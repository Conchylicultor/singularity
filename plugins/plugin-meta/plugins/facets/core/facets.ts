   * ONE FIELD, NOT TWO, and that is the whole point — do not flatten it back into

   * contributions silently vanish. That is not hypothetical — it is how a
   * `docs/plugins-details.md` missing reorder's entire `Contributes:` block got
   * committed, and how it made `main` un-pushable four commits later. A runtime
   * assert used to catch it here; pairing the two makes the state unspellable
   * instead, so there is nothing left to assert.

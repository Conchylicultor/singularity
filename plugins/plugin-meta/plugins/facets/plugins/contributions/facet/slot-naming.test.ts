// These tests replace a guard that no longer exists. The facet used to throw
// when it was handed barrels in a process where no slot-declaration pass had
// run, because reading a derived `contributions` array that early answers with a
// silently smaller set. The barrels and the naming of the pass over them now
// arrive as ONE value (`ExtractContext.imported`), so that state is unspellable
// and there is nothing left to assert.
//
// What is worth testing instead is what the facet DOES with that naming — and
// note what is no longer true of these tests: not one of them depends on how
// many passes have run in this process. Each mints its own naming and reads
// answers only out of that one. Process-global state deciding a reader's answer
// is the disease the pairing cures; a test that reintroduced the dependency
// would be testing the thing that was removed.

// A plugin dir that cannot exist, so the static half of `extract` reads no files
// and the tests stay hermetic — no tree build, no barrel imports, no disk.

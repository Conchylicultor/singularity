 * How a resource's mode reads wherever it is shown — `"push"`, `"keyed"`, or
 * `"keyed, window"` / `"keyed, point"` when the descriptor declares a bounded
 * membership, and `", unbounded: <reason>"` appended for a collection-shaped
 * Postgres value that declared why it is not a collection.
 *
 * One function rather than four spellings, because the four surfaces (doc,
 * detail pane, contributions table, PR diff) each render the same fact and a
 * membership added to one of them would otherwise be missing from the rest.
 * A window and a point resource are both `mode: "keyed"` at runtime, so without
 * the suffix none of the surfaces can tell a bounded resource from the legacy
 * unbounded keyed form the working-set contract is migrating away from.

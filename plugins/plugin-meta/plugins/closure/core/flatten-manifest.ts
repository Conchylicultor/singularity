/**
 * Resolve a manifest's `extends` chain into a single flat manifest. The result's
 * `entryPoints` + `selectedContributors` are the UNION of this manifest's own,
 * every transitively-extended composition's, and the base-exclusions row's, with
 * `extends` cleared (`[]`). Everything the engine consumes
 * (`resolveComposition`, the causality queries, the `composition-closure` check)
 * operates on a flattened manifest, so `extends` is a pure pre-resolution
 * rewrite — never a special case downstream.
 *
 * Conservative + total, mirroring the rest of the engine:
 * - **Diamond/cycle-safe** — a `visited` set over composition NAMES means each
 *   composition is folded in at most once, so `a extends b`, `b extends a`, or two
 *   paths to the same pack all terminate and union cleanly.
 * - **Unknown names pass inertly** — an `extends` entry with no matching manifest
 *   in `registry` contributes nothing (exactly like an unknown plugin id in
 *   `entryPoints` flows inertly through `expandEntrySeeds`). Whether the name
 *   resolves is the `composition-closure` check's job, not resolution's.
 *
 * `name` and any other fields are carried from the root manifest unchanged.

  //
  // Looked up by `name` because that is how `extends` already resolves a

  // registry: a synthetic registry that has none flattens exactly as before,
  // inertly — same rule as an unknown `extends` name.

 * inspecting, shared across every Studio surface (the explorer tree-row bands and
 * the plugin-detail sections live in different panes of the same app). Like the
 * pane route store, the value lives in a single module-level instance whose state
 * is held in closure variables and read back through instance methods (NOT a
 * module-level `let` read directly by the `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot), so the
 * `scoped-store/no-module-mutable-store` shape does not apply.
 *
 * The graph is supplied by `useCompositionData()` (which deserializes it once); the
 * membership recompute keys on both the active manifest reference and the graph
 * reference, so swapping either re-resolves exactly once.

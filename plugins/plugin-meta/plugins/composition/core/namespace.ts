// The composition-name vocabulary: what a composition may be CALLED, and which
// of those names a composition may also be SERVED under.
//
// This file's only import is `@plugins/infra/plugins/namespace/core`, which is
// itself zero-import — so the reachability that matters is preserved. Build-time
// tooling (codegen, the CLI, the checks), the server, and the browser all need to
// ask the same questions — "is this a legal composition id?" and "may
// a serve build provision a namespace for it?" — and a module whose closure
// touches no runtime API is reachable from every one of those runtimes. The
// vocabulary used to live in codegen's `plugin-registry-gen.ts`, which imports
// `fs` at module scope, so web and server could not reach it and each
// hand-rolled its own approximation.

// A composition id is one LABEL of a namespace — `<composition>.<checkout>` joins
// two of them — and it is also a per-name registry file segment, which is what
// makes it path-safe by construction. So the grammar is NOT restated here: it is
// `NAMESPACE_LABEL_RE`, owned by the namespace plugin and pinned to the
// gateway's own regex by the `namespace:grammar-in-sync` check. Deliberately not
// re-exported under a composition-flavoured alias either — a second name for one
// rule is how the third copy got written last time.

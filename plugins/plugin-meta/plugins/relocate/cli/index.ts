 * `./singularity plugin move <from> <to>` — relocating or renaming a plugin as
 * ONE tested step instead of a bespoke sed session per move.
 *
 * `plugin` is a GROUP: it routes and never runs, so bare `./singularity plugin`
 * prints its subcommand help by construction. The declaration is data; the
 * body sits behind its own lazy `import()`, so every other `./singularity`
 * invocation pays for this file alone (`cli:command-declarations-light`).

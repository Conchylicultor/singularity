// Host-scoped boot warm-up for the two in-memory plugin-tree caches. The full
// facets build is ~5s of pure CPU (every plugin × every facet extractor) and
// both memos die with the process, so on main — which restarts on every deploy —
// the first Studio/plugin-view request of each process paid the whole build
// synchronously (slow-op: GET /api/composition/data, 5–42s per cold hit).
// Pre-building here moves that cost off the interactive path into the drain's
// throttled post-boot window. `host` scope: worktree backends skip it — their
// Studio surfaces are rarely opened, and N×-worktree boots would multiply a 5s
// CPU burn exactly when the host is busiest. They keep the lazy cold path.

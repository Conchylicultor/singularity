/**
 * Build-scoped, read-once, parallel in-memory FS snapshot for facet extraction.
 *
 * The facet-extraction pass re-reads the whole plugin source tree several times
 * over (once per file-walking facet) via synchronous `readFileSync` /
 * `readdirSync`, monopolizing the single event loop for many seconds. This walks
 * the needed directories ONCE, asynchronously and in parallel (OS-saturating,
 * non-blocking), reading every source file a single time into memory. Wired into
 * the extract loop via `runWithFsSnapshot`, it makes the (still-synchronous)
 * facet `extract()` functions touch zero disk.
 *
 * Coverage mirrors what the parse-utils scanners read: `walkFiles` surfaces
 * `.ts`/`.tsx`, and `readIfExists` additionally reads `package.json`. We record
 * every directory we descend into (so an absent file resolves to `null` with no
 * syscall) and read exactly those file kinds. Any directory NOT covered here is
 * transparently re-read from disk by the helpers, so the snapshot only ever
 * speeds things up — it can never change a scanner's result.

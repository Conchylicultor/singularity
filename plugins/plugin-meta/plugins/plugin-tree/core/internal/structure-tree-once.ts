/**
 * The STRUCTURE-ONLY plugin tree (steps 1–3 of `buildPluginTree`: the walk,
 * each barrel's description/flags, the hierarchy — no facets, no barrels
 * imported), built once per `pluginsRoot` for the life of the process and
 * handed to every caller as the SAME frozen value.
 *
 * WHO IT IS FOR. One-shot processes that ask the same question many times —
 * above all a check pass, where ~100 checks share one JS thread and six of them
 * used to rebuild this tree each, back to back. The structure is a pure function
 * of the checkout's plugin folders and barrel headers, which nothing in such a
 * process writes, so one build answers them all.
 *
 * WHO IT IS NOT FOR. A long-lived server: the memo never invalidates, so a
 * plugin added after the first call is never seen. A backend reads
 * `getStructureTreeCached` from this plugin's `server` barrel, which rebuilds on
 * a filesystem watcher. The codegen trees (`buildBarrelFreeTree` /
 * `buildEnrichedTree`) are its facet-carrying twins, cached the same way.
 *
 * FROZEN, because it is shared: a check that sorted `roots` or deleted from
 * `byDir` would silently change what every later check reads, in whatever order
 * the run happened to schedule them. Nodes, their records and arrays are
 * `Object.freeze`d (a write throws — modules are strict), and the two maps'
 * mutators throw. A caller that needs a different shape builds its own from it.
 *
 * Check code must come through here (or a codegen memo), never call
 * `buildPluginTree` itself — enforced by the `plugin-tree/no-uncached-tree-in-checks`
 * lint rule.

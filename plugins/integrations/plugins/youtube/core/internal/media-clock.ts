// ── A smooth media clock over a jittery playhead ─────────────────────────────
//
// An embedded player reports its time in steps: the IFrame API posts the
// current time a few times a second, and a reader extrapolating between posts
// jumps by tens of milliseconds whenever a post lands. Something slaved to that
// playhead — a synth playing along — hears every jump as a slip. The model
// below turns the readings into a continuous clock: a line (when, where, rate)
// that is refitted on every new reading and SLEWED toward it, at most 5 % faster
// or slower than the rate, so a small disagreement is absorbed over time
// instead of jumped. A large one (a seek) snaps.

/** Disagreements past this many seconds are jumps (a seek), not jitter: snap. */

/**
 * The single "fix my Gmail connection" affordance — the one place that maps an
 * unmet prerequisite to the control that actually resolves it, in situ:
 *
 * - `disabled`     → flip the Settings toggle (no navigation)
 * - `disconnected` → the Google OAuth connect popup
 * - `scopes`       → the Gmail scope-grant popup
 *
 * Consumers (Mail's landing empty-state, its sync-status banner) render this
 * rather than routing the user to Settings to work it out for themselves — and
 * they get the affordance without importing `@plugins/auth`, which this
 * integration exists to broker on their behalf.
 *
 * `reconnect` forces the grant affordance even when local state looks healthy:
 * a server-side auth failure (revoked/expired grant upstream) is invisible to
 * the browser's cached scope list, so `blocker` is null while sync is in fact
 * dead. Re-running consent is the fix in both cases.

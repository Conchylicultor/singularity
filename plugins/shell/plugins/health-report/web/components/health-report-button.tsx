 * - not known yet → a grey dot, pulsing, until every row has reported;
 * - the dot also pulses while a row is transitioning (reconnecting).
 *
 * Clicking opens the report. The button owns its own status store and mounts
 * one probe per status row, so the dot is coloured whether or not the report is
 * open — mount exactly one of these per page. Its density is the ambient
 * `ControlSize` of wherever it is placed.

 * collapsed floating bar's build, …) — draws a ring around the dot and joins
 * the tooltip. The button names no source; the host gathers them.

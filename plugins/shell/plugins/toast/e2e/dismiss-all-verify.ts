// Verifies the toast stack's "Dismiss all" affordance end-to-end: seeds a
// pile-up of real toasts, asserts the button appears (and only once the stack
// is plural), asserts the number it prints IS the stack, asserts it never
// overlaps the front toast, and asserts one click clears the whole stack.
//
// It also asserts the property underneath all of that: that every toast the app
// fires actually reaches the DOM. A burst is watched by a MutationObserver and
// posted-vs-inserted is compared, because a toast lost on the way to the screen
// is invisible to every other check here — the count and the stack agree, both
// short.
//
// The toasts are real ones: the script POSTs notifications through the app's own
// `POST /api/notifications` endpoint from the page context, and the bell plugin
// turns each arrival into a toast. Nothing is stubbed. Each seeded notification
// is dismissed by id at the end, so the run leaves the worktree as it found it.

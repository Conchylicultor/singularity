 * It must never repeat. `Observer.create` merges by id against
 * `ToastState.toasts` (sonner 2.0.7, `dist/index.mjs:145`) — an array sonner
 * never prunes — so a reused id republishes, and thereby resurrects, a toast
 * that died minutes ago. A string is disjoint from sonner's own numeric
 * counter by construction, and the session prefix keeps an HMR reload (which
 * restarts `seq` under a still-live sonner module) from colliding with the
 * ids the previous module instance handed out.
 *
 * It must also never be falsy: `toastFunction` resolves `data?.id || counter++`
 * (`dist:374`), so an empty-string id would silently get a sonner id instead,
 * and the ledger — keyed by the id the body was given — would count a toast
 * that no dismiss can ever reach.

 * lifetime, and making the enclosing sonner `<li>` dismiss on click.
 *
 * Registering here rather than at enqueue time is the ledger's whole invariant:
 * an enqueue sonner drops never mounts and so is never counted, and every exit
 * a toast has (timer, close button, swipe, action button, programmatic
 * dismiss, the host unmounting) converges on this one unmount — so none of

/**
 * The toast ledger's DOM contract: `useLiveToastCount()` equals the number of
 * `[data-sonner-toast]` elements on screen, through every path a toast takes in
 * and out of the DOM.
 *
 * Two cases are regressions and are expected to FAIL against the enqueue-time
 * ledger this replaces — "a toast no <Toaster/> ever rendered" (defect A) and
 * "a toast fired from an effect above the toaster" (defect B).
 *
 * Sonner is mounted here as a bare `<Toaster/>`, not the plugin's
 * `<ToasterHost/>`: the host exists to carry theme scope, colour mode and the
 * measured action strip, none of which the ledger has an opinion about, and all
 * of which would drag the theme engine and the ui-kit into a test about a Set.
 *
 * Pinned against sonner 2.0.7; every `dist:<n>` below is a line in that
 * version's `dist/index.mjs`.

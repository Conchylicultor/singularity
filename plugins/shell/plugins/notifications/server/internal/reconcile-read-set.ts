// The `notifications` table has exactly one live-state reader — the
// `notifications` resource. Assert that invariant on boot: evict any stale
// `notifications` edge that a past mis-attribution baked into another resource's
// read-set. The read-set index is append-only + persisted + re-seeded, so a
// historical mis-attribution never self-heals otherwise (see
// research/2026-07-07-global-read-set-notifications-attribution-noise.md). This is
// a durable guard — it also catches any future regression on the same table.
//
// Called from the plugin's onReady, which runs AFTER live-state-snapshot's
// onReadyBlocking seed (the onReadyBlocking barrier fully completes before any
// onReady), so the in-memory index is populated and the persisted column is safe
// to touch. Cosmetic cleanup: a failure is reported loudly but must NOT crash
// boot, mirroring live-state-snapshot's own graceful-degradation hooks.

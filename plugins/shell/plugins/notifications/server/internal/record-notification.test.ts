/**
 * Suite for the bell's re-surface semantics — the half of the reports engine's
 * re-alert floor that lives in SQL. `writeNotification`'s ON CONFLICT set
 * decides, per dedup hit, whether the row comes back as a fresh unread alert
 * (`createdAt < now - resurfaceAfterMs`) or only coalesces. That CASE is the
 * thing `RENOTIFY_FLOOR_MS` steers, so it is driven here against a throwaway
 * Postgres (db-test-fixture) seeded with the REAL migration chain, rather than
 * restated in the test.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/shell/plugins/notifications`

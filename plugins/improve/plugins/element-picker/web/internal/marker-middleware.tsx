 * data and it stamps them on the one element it draws around each contribution.
 * A wrapper would land wherever this plugin happened to put it, and that is
 * exactly how the picker used to lie — the wrapper sat inside the layout cell a
 * row slot draws, so a click on the cell (all the slack around a small widget:
 * most of what there is to hit when the widget is a 4px progress bar in a 24px
 * row) climbed past the whole contribution and answered with the enclosing pane.
 * As data there is no placement to get right, here or in any future consumer.
 *
 * Registering here rather than in `ui-context` keeps it opt-in: it describes
 * *every* slot contribution repo-wide, and that cost should only be paid when
 * the element-picker is actually in the app composition. `<UiRegion>` — a
 * handful of explicit call sites — has no such constraint and lives in the
 * primitive.

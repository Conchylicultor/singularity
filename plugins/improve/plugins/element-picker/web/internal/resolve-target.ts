/**
 * Hit-testing for the inspector overlay — "what is under this pixel?".
 *
 * `document.elementFromPoint` answers a *different* question: "what would
 * receive a click here?". It honours `pointer-events`, which encodes the app's
 * **interactivity policy** — but picking is inspection, not interaction. Every
 * element the app has made non-interactive is invisible to it:
 *
 * - a disabled control (`disabled:pointer-events-none` on the button variant),
 * - a button's icon glyph (`[&_svg]:pointer-events-none`),
 * - click-through layers (`Overlay clickThrough`, decorative `Pin`).
 *
 * A pick on any of those silently resolved to the nearest *interactive
 * ancestor* and reported plausible-but-wrong metadata for a container the user
 * never pointed at — the failure mode that made the picker's own button
 * (disabled while picking is active) report the action bar's wrapper `div`.
 *
 * So the browser's hit test only **seeds** the search: from the element it
 * returns we descend to the deepest visible descendant whose box actually
 * contains the point, ignoring `pointer-events` entirely.

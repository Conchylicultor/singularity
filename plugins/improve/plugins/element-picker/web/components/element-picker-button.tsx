/**
 * The Improve pill's picker segment (`[✦ Improve | ⌖]`): pick an element, then
 * insert it into the Improve draft, opening the popover if it isn't already.
 * Identical in effect to the in-form `TaskDraftPickerButton` — one insertion,
 * added to whatever is already drafted — differing only in that this one
 * doesn't need the popover open to start. A ghost segment, like the Improve
 * button it is joined to: no fill and no outline, its icon in the bar's quiet
 * resting tone (inherited from the bar row), brightening on hover (ghost's
 * `hover:text-foreground`).

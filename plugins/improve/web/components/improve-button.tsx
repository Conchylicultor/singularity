 * The Improve pill: the Improve button (opening the draft popover) joined with

 * same draft, such as picking a UI element — as one split capsule. Every
 * segment is a ghost: a quiet bar button, no fill and no outline, so the pill
 * reads as one labelled action rather than a framed box inside the bar's own
 * capsule. Only the Improve label is in the text colour; the icons (its sparkle
 * and the companions) keep the bar's quieter tone, like its other icons, and
 * brighten on hover.

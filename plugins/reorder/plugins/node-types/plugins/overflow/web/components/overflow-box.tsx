/**
 * The `overflow` container node type's box. Two forms, keyed on edit mode:
 *
 * - **live** — an `AdaptiveBar.Collapsed`: the bar's item/panel machinery with
 *   the measurement taken out, so every member relocates unconditionally into
 *   the `⋯` panel. Membership here is AUTHORED in the slot's config, which is
 *   exactly what "no width has a say in it" means.
 * - **edit mode** — a labelled inline box (mirroring `HeaderBox`) so an author
 *   can see and drag the bucket's members. A closed panel would hide them from
 *   the pen's drag affordances, so the two branches stay separate on purpose.
 *
 * Each member renders **its own declared form**: an `IconButton` declares the
 * `"row"` rung and becomes a labelled `PanelActionRow`; anything richer renders
 * as itself and stays usable. That is the whole point of the bar — the old
 * `<ActionPresentation mode="menu">` wrapper transformed every member into a
 * menu row, so a member that was not a plain action had nowhere to go.
 *
 * Renders **nothing** when the bucket is empty — and *empty* means "no member
 * actually rendered", not "no member is authored". An item action returns `null`
 * for a row it does not apply to (Close on an already-closed conversation, Move
 * to top on the row that is already top), so a bucket holding five authored
 * actions can still come to nothing on a given row. Two different emptinesses,
 * answered in two places:
 *
 * - **no authored members at all** — the guard below, and the box renders no DOM
 *   whatsoever (not even the bar's always-mounted panel).
 * - **members that all rendered nothing** — the bar's own answer. Each member is
 *   mounted exactly once into its own container, so `childElementCount === 0`
 *   says it drew nothing; such a member is `hidden`, is never eligible for the
 *   panel, and the `⋯` follows the panel's occupancy rather than the member
 *   count. No trigger is painted for a bucket that came to nothing on this row.
 *
 * That replaces action-presentation's `probe` pass, which answered the same
 * question by instantiating every member a SECOND time to draw nothing and be
 * counted — and only ever counted `IconButton`s, so it was blind to a member
 * that hand-rolled its markup. The double mount (its own comment admitted "a
 * member exists twice while its menu is open") is gone with it: one instance,
 * always.

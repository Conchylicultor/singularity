 *
 * NOTHING here reads the generated `reorderable-slots.generated.ts`. That is not
 * a preference: the manifest is now derived from the declarations by importing
 * web barrels, so a web barrel that imported it at module-load would freeze the
 * PREVIOUS run's copy in the codegen process (Bun's ESM cache) and no later
 * write could refresh it. The server keeps reading it — it cannot see web slots,
 * and its barrels are imported after the manifest is written.
 *
 * `useConfig`/`useSetConfig` match a config registration by descriptor
 * *reference identity* (`reg.descriptor === descriptor`), so the descriptor
 * passed to `ConfigV2.WebRegister` and the one the middleware looks up MUST be
 * the same object. `descriptorFor` is memoized per slot id and never replaces an
 * entry, which is what guarantees that across repeated declaration passes.

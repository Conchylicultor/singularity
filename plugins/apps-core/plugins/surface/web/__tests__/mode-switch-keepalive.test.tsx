// What the whole fix is about: switching the surface mode must NOT remount the
// open tabs. The regression it pins is a host that returned its tab container
// wrapped in a portal for one mode and bare for another — two different children
// at one tree position, which React reconciles by deleting the subtree and
// building a new one, taking every tab's scroll, uncommitted edit and iframe
// with it.
//
// Four assertions, because three of them can pass while the bug is back:
// mount/unmount counts and the instance id prove REACT kept the component, and
// the DOM node object proves nobody re-parented the node underneath it (a
// stable-container relocation would keep React happy and still reload an
// iframe).

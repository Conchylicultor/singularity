/**
 * The one place a {@link PlacementFrame} role becomes CSS. A mode declares the
 * role; this host owns the mechanics, so the two can never drift apart and a
 * mode cannot spell a geometry the host does not know how to unwind.
 *
 * - `pane` — fills the surface box it is rendered in.
 * - `window` — a free box positioned by the mode's own `Chrome` (floating's
 *   geometry push). `overflow-hidden` is part of the ROLE, not one mode's taste:
 *   a window frame that leaks past its own rounded corner is a bug in every
 *   conceivable window mode.
 * - `viewport` — `fixed`, against the real window. `z-overlay` and NOT `z-max`:
 *   with the backdrop's transform dropped (see `escapesSurface` below) the
 *   container sits in the ROOT stacking context, alongside every body-portaled
 *   popover, so a higher band would paint its opaque background over every
 *   popover/dropdown/dialog opened from inside the fullscreen app. `z-overlay`
 *   still covers all app chrome (`z-nav`) and the surface backdrop, and
 *   `z-popover` overlays still paint above it.
 *
 * It is a module const rather than an inline class literal for the same reason
 * `<ViewportOverlay>`'s own recipe is: this module is the OWNER of these
 * mechanics, and an owner is deliberately opaque to the `no-adhoc-*` rules that
 * redirect everyone else to it. Those rules harvest literals from class-name
 * attributes and `cn()` arguments; a plain object read through an identifier is
 * neither, so no per-site disable is needed here (`<Card>` / `<Surface>` /
 * `<ViewportOverlay>` all stay clear of their own lint the same way).

 *
 * This body is GENERIC: it names no specific placement. Every placement (docked /

 * of `TabSurface`). It pushes dynamic inline style (floating's geometry box /

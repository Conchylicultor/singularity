/**
 * The solo (fullscreen) surface mode: only the focused tab, full-viewport. It
 * asks for the `viewport` frame, which is the whole statement: the host both
 * positions the container against the window and drops the `transform` off its
 * backdrop while this mode is active, so the box resolves against the viewport
 * instead of the content area (the exact mechanics, and why the frame's z-band
 * is `z-overlay` and not `z-max`, live on `FRAME_CLASS` in the host). The tab
 * itself does not move: the container stays exactly where it is in the tree,
 * which is what keeps the app inside it mounted (its scroll, its edits, its
 * iframes).
 *
 * Mutual exclusion with windows mode is guaranteed one level up, structurally:
 * the surface is in exactly ONE mode, and each mode renders every tab under its
 * own descriptor. Solo does not set `visibleWhenUnfocused`, so only the focused
 * tab is painted and it declares no Backdrop/Foreground — so entering solo drops
 * the desktop wallpaper + window dock. There is simply no window to overlap it.

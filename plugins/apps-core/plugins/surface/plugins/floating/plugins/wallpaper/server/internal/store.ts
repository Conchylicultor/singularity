// Machine-global wallpaper store, at `apps/desktop/wallpaper/` — this plugin's
// area inside the desktop meta-app's one data dir (`apps-core/data-dirs`). The
// wallpaper is the desktop's content, not an app of its own, so it takes a
// subdir there rather than declaring an `apps/*` dir. A SINGLETON: there is
// exactly one current desktop wallpaper, so the image always lands at the same
// path (a fixed name) and is overwritten on each save. The mime is sidecar
// metadata so the image route can serve the right content-type after a restart.
//
// Until main has moved them, the bytes still sit at the old `apps/wallpaper/`.
// That is the desktop dir's business, not this file's: its `movedFrom` entry
// resolves this area to the old location in every process that is not the host
// singleton, so the store reads and writes the same bytes before and after.
//
// Functions, not consts — the subdir handle included: `DataDir.path` is
// resolved per read, because the data root is env-overridable (and the pending
// move settles at runtime), so a value frozen at module eval would capture
// whatever was true when this module was first imported.

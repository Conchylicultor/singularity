/**
 * The desktop dock (taskbar) for floating windows — the floating placement's
 * {@link PlacementDef.Foreground}, rendered once above all windows whenever the
 * floating Foreground is mounted. A macOS-style centered, translucent bar: one
 * chip per **window on the active virtual desktop** (active member's app icon +
 * title, suffixed ` (N)` when the window groups several tabs). The focused (and
 * visible) window reads as active; minimized windows dim, since they have fully
 * left the desktop. It is the restore target once a window is minimized.
 *
 * Its LEFT segment hosts the {@link WorkspacePager} — the per-desktop pager,
 * whose pills are miniature desktops (each window drawn at its real position) —
 * separated from the window chips by a thin divider, so the whole thing reads as
 * one cohesive bottom shelf (KDE / ChromeOS pattern) rather than two competing
 * centered bars. The pager organizes windows; like the dock it is still
 * windows/organization-only, never an app launcher (see this plugin's CLAUDE.md
 * passive-backdrop invariant). The bar therefore always renders while the
 * Foreground is mounted — even when the active desktop has zero windows, the user
 * must still see and switch desktops.
 *
 * The pager's mini-desktops need the desktop's pixel size to place a free window
 * (a snapped window resolves resolution-independently). We measure the dock
 * anchor's `offsetParent` — the desktop backdrop, a `position: relative` box —
 * via {@link useElementSize}'s `ResizeObserver` and hand it to the pager.
 *
 * Click follows the taskbar convention: the already-focused, non-minimized
 * window minimizes (toggles back to the dock); any other (or a minimized) window
 * un-minimizes, raises to front, and focuses its active member. Each chip is a
 * {@link ToggleChip} (the canonical stateful pill — icon + truncating label +
 * active state) so the dock writes no raw layout mechanics; the chips wrap via
 * {@link Cluster}.

 * The default rail: an icon rail (`APP_RAIL_WIDTH`) beside the app content. Sets
 * `--app-rail-width` (the rail's own width, read by AppRail) and places the
 * rail as a flex sibling of `body`, so the body starts after the rail. The app
 * shell's sidebar — fixed but bounded to `body` — pins to `body`'s left edge
 * with no extra offset. Pixel-identical to the pre-region app rail.

 * The app chrome's theme — the rail, the tab strip, the action bar and the
 * toasts, plus every popover opened from them. A fixed theme: it is the same
 * whichever app is focused and whether the page is light or dark, so an app
 * with its own look is framed by the same neutral frame as every other one.
 *
 * Beyond colours it names only what makes it read as quiet chrome: its two
 * heights, lighter control labels (12.5px, regular — a tab's title and a
 * button's label alike), font smoothing that draws light text at the font's
 * own weight, and Lucide icons. The font, the rest of the type scale, radii
 * and spacing are the defaults every app uses, so the chrome is set in the
 * same face as the apps it hosts.

# tabs

## Shell history: snapshots, not URLs

The shell has one source of truth per tab (each tab's pane store) and **one
linear browser-history timeline that is a pure projection of them**. A history
entry is a **complete snapshot of what the user was looking at**:
`{ tabId, appId, route | pending }`. Nothing reads the URL to decide identity —
the URL and `history.state` are write-only projections; `popstate` is the one
place they are read back.

`TabsProvider` installs the **shell history adapter** (`shell-history-adapter.ts`)
into the pane primitive's `HistoryAdapter` seam (`setHistoryAdapter`):

- **`commit`** stamps the focused tab's `{ tabId, appId }` onto every entry the
  pane store writes, and announces `shell:navigate`. This is the ONE sanctioned
  low-level `window.history` writer in the tabs layer.
- **`restore`** (real browser back/forward only) reads the snapshot back and
  rebuilds it with zero URL parsing: refocus the tab by `tabId`, re-sync its app
  in place if `appId` differs (a fresh store bound to the snapshot's app —
  **never** minting a tab, so a closed-tab entry applies to the focused tab and
  back/forward can't grow the set), then `handleLocationChange()` restores the
  route. Legacy / `{}` entries (pre-deploy, or the apps-layout redirect) fall
  back to `matchAppForPath(URL)`.

**Push vs replace.** Every user-initiated change to what's on screen **pushes**
(pane open/close, `navigate()`, rail click, open-tab, **focus-tab** — Back
traverses tab focus too). **Replace** only for corrections that must not be
independently reachable: boot's initial composite stamp, the canonicalization
redirect, and close-tab neighbor refocus. Restoration never writes history.

**One app-identity source for chrome.** Chrome outside a surface (rail
highlight, theme scope, `:root` tokens) reads the focused tab's app from the
`focusedApp` module store (`apps-core/web` → `setFocusedApp`/`useFocusedAppId`),
published on every focus/app change and synchronously during a restore — never
by parsing the URL. So the theme can never diverge from what the focused surface
shows. The canonicalization redirect (apps-layout) stays URL-driven
(`matchAppForPath`) — that is a legitimately different question.

Because `tabId`s are sessionStorage-stable, a snapshot stamped before a reload
still matches after it, so back/forward keeps working across reloads.

## In-app links: one URL resolution, two destinations

`navigate(url, { newTab })` is the only way to open a pane, in this tab or a
fresh one — `openTab(appId)` can reach an app's *index* only, so it can't
express "open THIS pane in a new tab". Keeping it one function keeps both
destinations on one URL resolution (dead-link + unresolved-pane checks
included). A new tab is always fresh, even when the target app is the focused
one.

`appLinkProps(url)` spreads onto any control to give it browser link gestures
(click = here, ⌘/Ctrl- or middle-click = new tab), reading them via
`primitives/link-gesture` — the same reader the pane primitive's Expand uses. Do
NOT reach for `<a href>`: these URLs address *in-app* tabs, so an anchor's
middle-click cold-boots a whole second SPA in a browser tab instead.

`navigate` is also installed into the pane primitive's `app-nav-sink` here, so a
pane that declares a home app can be promoted into it. Pane sits below tabs and
cannot import it, hence the sink.

## Keep-alive means a background tab still has listeners

Every open tab stays MOUNTED — unfocused ones are `display: none`, and the
floating placement shows several at once. So a `window`-level `keydown` a pane
registers is live in background tabs too, and one Escape reaches all of them.
`useSurfaceFocused()` is the gate: it compares the caller's `useSurfaceTabId()`
against `focusedTabId`, and answers `true` outside any surface (chrome has no
background-tab ambiguity, and returning `false` there would kill the handlers
the hook exists to keep honest).

## App instances: three different things called a "tab"

Keep these apart — they are three layers, and the persisted state hangs off the
middle one:

| Concept | Identity | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **Browser tab** | `getTabId()` (`primitives/scope/tab-id`) | one sessionStorage namespace |
| **App instance** | one running SPA app-state, `getAppInstanceId()` (`primitives/scope/app-instance`) | its tab set, focus, surface mode, window geometry |
| **In-app tab** | `tabId` in this plugin's tab set | one pane store |

One browser tab hosts a *sequence* of app instances over its lifetime. Every
cross-document load either **mints** a new instance or **adopts** an existing
one, and that decision — not the browser tab — is what decides whether the user
sees their previous tabs. Persisted keys are therefore
`app-tabs:<tabId>:<gen>` / `app-windows:<tabId>:<gen>`, never the bare
2-segment form. Design: `research/2026-07-24-global-app-instance-boundary.md`.

**The decision table** (owned by `primitives/scope/app-instance`, restated here
because it is what the tab set means):

| Load | Instance | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|
| Bookmark / address bar / link from another app (`navigate`) | **mint** | one tab seeded from the URL, default surface mode, no window geometry |
| Reload (`reload`) | adopt (entry's, else last-active) | unchanged |
| Back/forward across documents (`back_forward`) | adopt the entry's instance | that whole instance — all its tabs, its focus, its surface mode |
| Nav type unavailable (jsdom, older engines) | treated as `reload` | unchanged — unknown must never destroy |
| In-app navigation | n/a (no document load) | unaffected |

Two signals decide it, and both are needed: the **navigation type** decides
*fresh vs. preserve* (it is a property of the load and cannot be clobbered),
while **`history.state.appInstance`** decides *which* instance to adopt. A
history entry therefore **names its instance** alongside its tab — the composite
is `{ tabId, appId, appInstance, route | pending }`. Where the entry's instance
is not this one, `restore()` distrusts its `tabId` entirely and falls back to
URL reparsing; where the entry's `tabId` disagrees with the persisted
`focusedTabId` on a back/forward boot, **the entry wins** (a history entry is a
complete snapshot).

Consequences worth remembering:

- The two-tabs-after-a-bookmark bug is fixed **by the storage key alone**: on a
  `navigate` boot the key names a fresh generation, so `loadPersistedTabs()`
  returns null and the existing seed-one-tab-from-the-URL path runs. Surface
  mode resets for free through `persisted?.mode ?? ""` — boot seeds the
  unresolved `""` (it runs during render, so it must not sample the placement
  registry) and `TabsProvider` resolves it to the registered default reactively,
  against `usePlacementCapabilities()`, on every render.
- Old generations are **not** swept on a fresh boot: Back into an older instance
  is a cross-document load that re-boots from storage, so the retained
  generation count is a real UX knob (how many bookmark hops back restore in
  full). Past it, a back/forward boots a single-tab instance from the entry's
  own snapshot, reusing its `tabId`.
- Nothing here is a device preference. Surface mode and window geometry are
  **instance state** and reset with the instance. (`persistent-draft` is
  deliberately the other way — it is localStorage, shared by design.)

### The pre-instance key migration (temporary)

Sessions opened before generations existed hold 2-segment `app-tabs:<tabId>` /
`app-windows:<tabId>` keys. Both consumers read those **gated and consuming**,
never as a bare `??` — the two halves defend the same silent failure (the
pre-deploy state reappearing in an instance that should have started clean) from
opposite sides. The gate is `mayAdoptLegacyPayload()` from
`primitives/scope/app-instance`, which owns the predicate and its rationale (in
particular why `isFreshAppInstance()` alone is *not* it); the consume
(`removeItem`) is the consumer's half, stopping any later fresh instance in the
same browser tab from finding the blob. Both call sites are marked for removal.

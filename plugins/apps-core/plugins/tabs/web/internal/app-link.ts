 * Turn any control into an in-app link to `url`: plain click navigates here,
 * ⌘/Ctrl- and middle-click open `url` in a new browser tab. Spread it onto the
 * control.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <IconButton icon={MdOpenInNew} label="Open the run" {...appLinkProps(url)} />
 * ```
 *
 * The browser-tab answer is the browser's own convention for those gestures,
 * which is what a user's hand already expects of anything that looks like a
 * link. The URL is app-rooted, so the new tab cold-boots straight into it. A new
 * IN-APP tab is a deliberate act instead — an explicit menu entry calling
 * `navigate(url, { newTab: true })` — never a modifier on a click.
 *
 * Still a button rather than an `<a href>`: the gestures come from
 * `link-gesture`, which is also what the pane primitive's Expand reads.

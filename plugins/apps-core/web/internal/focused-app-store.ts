// parsing the URL — so the "theme says app A while content shows app B"
// divergence class becomes structurally impossible. `TabsProvider` publishes it
// on every focus/app change (and boot); the shell history adapter publishes it
// during a back/forward restore, in the same mutation that repoints the focused
// tab — so chrome and content can never race the URL.
// eslint-disable-next-line scoped-store/no-module-mutable-store -- page-global by design: exactly one app is focused per page; mirrors focusedSurfaceId/surfaceMode. Published by the single TabsProvider + the shell history adapter, outside any per-surface tree, so it cannot be a per-surface scoped store.

 * Fetch upstream and measure how far behind local `main` is.

 * three git commands either way — this is them written once, so the command a
 * user runs by hand and the report that wakes them up can never disagree about
 * what "behind" means.
 *
 * It fetches. That is the point of calling it: the remote-tracking ref on disk
 * is as old as the last fetch, and a count against a stale ref is a number that
 * looks current and is not. Nothing else is written — no merge, no checkout, no
 * ref of ours moves.
 *
 * The fetch is the one call that may fail without it being a bug (see
 * {@link isCouldNotAsk}); every local git call after it is `spawnExpectOk`, so
 * a `main` that does not exist or an unreadable object store throws with git's
 * own words rather than coming back as zero commits behind.

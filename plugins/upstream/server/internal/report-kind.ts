/**
 * The `upstream-updates-available` report kind: **the repo this checkout was
 * cloned from has commits you do not have.**
 *
 * It exists because a clone user has no other way to learn that. Everything
 * else in this app is local — worktrees branch off local `main`, main rebuilds
 * itself when that ref moves — so upstream could move for months in silence.
 *
 * **It files no task.** An update is not a failure and not an emergency; it is
 * news. Reports already mint an investigation task on demand, so the user gets
 * a row in the bell and an Investigate button, and the merge happens when they
 * decide it does. `renderTask` below is what that button hands the agent.
 *
 * Variant `info` for the same reason: nothing is broken.
 *
 * ### One row, forever
 *
 * The fingerprint is a CONSTANT. "You are behind upstream" is one standing
 * fact whose count rises, not a new problem per commit — and a fingerprint
 * derived from the newest sha would mint a fresh row and a fresh alert every
 * time upstream moves, which is exactly the cross-fingerprint fan-out the
 * reports ceiling exists to collapse (see `plugins/reports/CLAUDE.md`). So
 * every detection lands on the same row, and the upsert refreshes its payload:
 * the row always names today's count and today's newest commits.
 *
 * Read the row's own `count` column as "how many days running this has been
 * true", NOT as a number of commits — the commit count lives in the payload.
 *
 * The cooldown is a week. Without one the bell row would be read once and never
 * resurface, and a user who ignores a five-commit gap should hear about it
 * again when it is a hundred; with the job running daily, a week means the
 * standing fact re-rings occasionally rather than every morning.

/**
 * Daily: has the repo this checkout was cloned from moved ahead of local
 * `main`? If so, record ONE report — the bell rings, Debug → Reports holds a
 * row, and that is all.
 *
 * **It files no task, and it merges nothing.** An update is news, not work
 * assigned: the user presses Investigate when they want it, and the task minted
 * then carries the merge instructions (`./internal/merge-prompt.ts`). Nothing
 * here writes to the working tree or moves a ref of ours; the only side effect
 * is a `git fetch` inside `fetchUpstreamStatus`.
 *
 * Main-only, by leaving `perWorktree` unset on the schedule. "Is there an
 * update?" is a question about the clone, not about one agent's branch, and
 * every worktree asking it would fetch the same remote N times a day to file
 * the same single row.
 *
 * On the author's own checkout there is no upstream — the remote it publishes
 * to is its own — and the job returns having done nothing.

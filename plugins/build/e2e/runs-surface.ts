/**
 * Verification pass for the merged **Runs** surface, driven through the browser.
 *
 * Written because four claims about this surface could not be made from
 * `screenshot.ts`:
 *
 *  1. **The Builds tab.** `screenshot.ts --click "Builds"` hits the Debug
 *     sidebar's own "Builds" nav item — it tries `role=button` before
 *     `radio`/`tab`, and the sidebar entry is a button. Here the tab strip is
 *     addressed by its own role, so the collision cannot happen.
 *  2. **Nested buttons.** A backup row holds two real controls (the disclosure
 *     and, on a failed target, Grant access). Those are only legal because the
 *     backup arm contributes no `open`, so `rowActivation` resolves the row to a
 *     plain container instead of a `<button>`. That is a DOM fact and needs the
 *     DOM to check.
 *  3. **Paging across an arm boundary.** The keyset cursor walks from one
 *     ledger's rows into another's; a duplicated or dropped row shows up only
 *     after scrolling past the boundary.
 *  4. **The pin.** `pinnedView` must render no switcher — a pinned host that
 *     still painted one would let a click there write the shared selection it
 *     ignores.
 *
 * Manual only; nothing runs this automatically. Run it after `./singularity
 * build` with:
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/build/e2e/runs-surface.ts
 *   ./singularity run plugins/build/e2e/runs-surface.ts --headed
 *
 * Assertions are written against MARKERS that belong to exactly one run kind,
 * not against row counts off a hand-picked selector: the DataView list exposes
 * no stable row attribute, and a selector guessed from today's markup would
 * turn a future refactor into a false failure.
 *
 *   build   → the namespace chip `att-…` (only builds project a namespace here;
 *             backups and deploys are host-global and read null)
 *   deploy  → `website on <ip>`, the deploy arm's own label
 *   backup  → the `N sources` chip

 * it carries none. So "a button that reports a pressed state, whose whole label

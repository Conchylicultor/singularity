/**
 * Verification pass for the **Logs** section of the build toolbar popover.
 *
 * Three claims that only the real DOM can settle:
 *
 *  1. **It starts shut.** The popover opens on the deployment chain, the Build
 *     control and the run list; the log stream is one chevron row until asked
 *     for. A screenshot shows the row but cannot say whether the body is
 *     genuinely absent or merely scrolled out of sight — the point of the change
 *     is that the body is not mounted at all, which is also what drops the log
 *     socket.
 *  2. **The copy button is a SIBLING of the disclosure, not a child of it.**
 *     The header is one click target; a copy button nested inside it would be
 *     invalid HTML and unreachable by keyboard. Only the DOM knows.
 *  3. **Opening it really streams.** The section fills with the build channel's
 *     ring buffer, so the region is non-empty after one click.
 *  4. **Nothing in the header moves when it opens.** The copy button is taller
 *     than the label's line, so a button that came and went took the row from
 *     28px to 36px and slid the chevron and the label down with it. Only
 *     geometry read off the live layout can say the jump is gone.
 *
 * Manual only; nothing runs this automatically. Run it after `./singularity
 * build` with:
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/build/e2e/popover-logs.ts
 *   ./singularity run plugins/build/e2e/popover-logs.ts --headed

/**
 * The build's step-view fallback — what is left of `run-build.test.ts` after the
 * migration, and the one thing in it that is still build's own.
 *
 * That suite covered `readBuildTerminal`, `isPidAlive` and the `close?`
 * composition. All three now belong to the supervised-run primitive and are
 * tested there (`supervised-run/core/internal/terminal.test.ts`), against the
 * same real files and real pids — so keeping a second copy here would be two
 * suites asserting one rule, which is how they drift.
 *
 * What is genuinely build's is the OTHER half of `build-logs-<id>.json`: the
 * step transcript the UI renders, and what happens when a build died before
 * writing one. `recoverBuildArtifacts` used to reconstruct it from the parent's
 * pipe; the recovery is now a read over the child's own transcript, so this is
 * where it is pinned.
 *
 * Driven against real files at the real resolved paths, like the suite it
 * replaces — the module reads `currentWorktreeName()` at call time and cannot be
 * pointed at a fixture dir.

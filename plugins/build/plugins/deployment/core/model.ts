 *   imported from.
 * - `web` — the frontend bundle this backend serves, pinned by the `.build-commit`
 *   / `.build-graph` trailers the build stamps into the dist.
 * - `tab` — the bundle one browser tab is actually running, pinned by the globals
 *   baked into it. The server cannot know this one; the client composes it in.

 * `server` and `web` are the DEPLOYABLE carriers — the two a build can move. A

 * one. The three reasons this actually happens are all determinate states, not
 * transient read failures:
 *
 * - a release bundle has no checkout, so nothing has a commit at all;
 * - a dist published before the pin existed carries no trailer;
 * - the checkout moved during the plugin-import wave, so the process is a mix of
 *   two trees and NO single commit is honest ("mixed boot").
 *
 * `graph` is the content identity of the composed web module graph. It is
 * `unresolved` on the `server` carrier for a category reason rather than a
 * failure — a server process carries no module graph — which is exactly what the
 * unresolved arm means: the answer is determinate, and it is "there is nothing
 * to determine".
 *

 * target?", measured on the server and carried here as a plain fact so the

/**

 *
 * A discriminated union rather than a bag of nullable fields, because the four
 * arms genuinely carry different evidence:
 *
 * - `converged` — every deployable carrier is at `target`. The chain is the walk
 *   from `target` to itself: exactly one row, for HEAD.
 * - `behind` — the chain runs from the oldest deployable pin up to `target`,
 *   inclusive of that pin's own commit so a carrier badge has a row to sit on.
 *   Building this list is git work, which is why it is computed on the server
 *   and shipped rather than re-derived by every consumer.
 *
 * Both answerable-and-on-the-line arms carry a `chain`, and that is deliberate:
 * a converged deployment used to carry a bare `target` sha and no rows, which
 * forced the client to hand-draw a row the normal renderer could not produce.
 * Two ways to draw one row meant two copies of "which carrier goes where", and
 * they drifted. One shape, one renderer.
 * - `diverged` — some carrier sits on a commit that is not an ancestor of
 *   `target` (a rebase or force-push under a running app). There is no line to
 *   draw, so no chain is carried.
 * - `unknown` — there is no `target` to be behind. A release bundle has no
 *   checkout, so the question is genuinely unanswerable; the field is ABSENT on
 *   this arm rather than null, so no consumer can read a target that isn't one.
 *   The carrier pins are still carried — they are facts even when the target is
 *   not.

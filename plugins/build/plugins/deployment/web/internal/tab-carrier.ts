/**
 * The `tab` carrier — which bundle THIS browser tab is actually running.
 *
 * It is composed client-side and is deliberately absent from the server's
 * `deployable` list, because the server genuinely cannot know it: two tabs open
 * against one backend can be running two different bundles, and only each tab
 * can name its own. It is also not a thing a build can move — a reload is — so
 * keeping it out of `deployable` is what stops a tab nobody reloads from
 * minting builds for ever.
 *
 * Both pins come from globals the build bakes into `index.html`
 * (`compose.ts` → `__SINGULARITY_GRAPH__` / `__SINGULARITY_COMMIT__`, which
 * `import.meta.env.VITE_BUILD_GRAPH` / `VITE_BUILD_COMMIT` compile to). Neither
 * is baked into a hashed artifact: either would churn every artifact hash on
 * every build.

/**
 * A baked global has three states, and collapsing any two of them is a lie:
 *
 * - **absent** (`undefined`) — no build stamped this page at all, i.e. a dev
 *   server. This is the case `use-stale-frontend` guards with its `"dev"`
 *   sentinel, and for the same reason: an absent pin means *unknown*, and must
 *   never read as a mismatch against whatever the server reports.
 * - **empty** (`""`) — a build stamped the page but could not name the value
 *   (compose injects `""` rather than omitting the global, so a consumer reads
 *   "unknown" instead of throwing on an undeclared identifier).
 * - **a value** — the bundle can name itself.
 *
 * The first two are `unresolved`, with distinct reasons: they are different
 * facts about the world, and the reason is what a user reads on the chain.

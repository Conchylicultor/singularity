 * (`{signal: null, armFailure: null}` when the host recorded nothing), which is
 * exactly the distinction this function needs: while the request is in flight it
 * must not claim there is no record.
 *
 * The invariant across every arm: **when we cannot name the sender, we say so.**
 * Rendering nothing would make "killed by something we could not identify" look
 * identical to "nothing killed it", which is the ambiguity this whole feature
 * exists to remove.

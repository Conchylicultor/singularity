// before it restarts this backend, so a value memoized at process start would
// disagree with the served bundle for the whole swap→restart window.
//
// The build stamps this with the commit it sampled BEFORE reading a single
// source file, so it names the tree these bytes actually came from — not
// whatever the checkout moved to while the compile ran. That distinction is the
// whole point: a `git rev-parse HEAD` taken after the compile once made a stale
// frontend read as current and cost a catch-up build.

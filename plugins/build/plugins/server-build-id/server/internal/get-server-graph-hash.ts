// memoized at process start would disagree with the served bundle for the whole
// swap→restart window and leave the "Server updated" reload button stuck.
// Resolving through the same live symlink the gateway serves from is what makes
// the reported value always the one in the browser's hands.
//
// Unlike the build id this pin is a function of the composed graph, so two
// builds of an unchanged tree return the same value — a tab holding it is not
// asked to reload for a rebuild that changed nothing.

 * How a build run ended, as one closed set. Four of the six arms are *not*
 * defects — only `failed` is a build that ran to a verdict and gave a bad one:
 *
 * - `superseded` — its tree was replaced mid-run, so it never had a subject
 *   (see `BUILD_EXIT_SUPERSEDED`'s docblock).
 * - `interrupted` — its owner was hard-killed by a newer build's restart, so
 *   there is no artifact and no verdict.
 * - `killed` — a signal arrived from outside the build (SIGTERM/SIGINT/…): a
 *   human, a supervisor, another agent. Says nothing about the code.
 *
 * Everything that renders or reasons about a run's outcome goes through
 * `buildStatusOf`, so no call site branches on exit codes again.

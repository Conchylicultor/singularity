// Reset a served composition to its genuine first-launch state — a NARROWER
// `reapAttempt` (cf. debug/worktree-cleanup/server/internal/reap.ts). A served
// composition is live at http://<namespace>.localhost:9000 with its own DB and
// config dir, both named by that namespace. This keeps the spec + dist + code
// (so it stays served) and wipes ONLY that one namespace's DB + config back to
// exactly what a serve build provisions on a fresh serve, then restarts the
// backend — so the author sees the real new-user experience.
//
// EVERYTHING here is scoped to THIS BACKEND'S CHECKOUT, and has to be: a
// composition is served from whichever checkout built it, so the id `sonata`
// names `sonata` from main and `sonata.att-x` from a worktree — two namespaces,
// two databases, two config dirs. `REPO_ROOT` is the checkout this backend runs
// out of, so `namespaceFor(id, checkoutRef(REPO_ROOT))` is the one this surface
// is talking about, and the git layer the config is re-propagated from is the
// same tree that composed it.
//
// Why config is RE-PROPAGATED, not just deleted: a bare `rm -rf` of the config
// dir would fall back to *code* defaults, not a genuine first-launch. Re-running
// propagateConfigToUser restores the shipped *git-layer* defaults compose-serve
// installs (`serveOne` calls the same function), so the reset lands on the exact
// first-launch config, not a code-default approximation.
//
// OUT OF SCOPE — central secrets / auth tokens: they live in one global encrypted
// store (~/.singularity/state/secrets/) shared by every namespace by the
// single-instance-per-user architecture, carry no per-composition dimension, and
// are deliberately untouched here (see research/2026-07-02-global-adr-single-
// instance-per-user.md).
//
// Never touches main: `assertServableCompositionNamespace` rejects the reserved
// {central, singularity, main} namespaces, and three more provenance guards below
// prove the target is a compose-serve-owned namespace before any data is touched.

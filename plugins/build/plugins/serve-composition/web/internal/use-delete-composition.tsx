/**
 * Deleting a composition — the whole concept, in one place.
 *
 * A composition is not just a config row: building it mints a namespace, and a
 * namespace is a live address, a Postgres database, a config dir and a built
 * frontend. Dropping the row alone leaves all of that on disk forever AND makes
 * it invisible, because every composition-aware surface is keyed off the row that
 * just vanished. So this asks the server what the composition owns, shows the
 * person exactly what they are about to lose, and gives it back before removing
 * the row.
 *
 * `remove(id)` in `plugin-meta/composition` stays the pure synchronous config
 * edit its name promises. Burying a reclaim inside it would put "delete
 * everything this composition owns" in a function whose call sites think they
 * are editing an array; the concept lives here instead, and both Studio delete
 * buttons call this, so they cannot drift.
 *
 * The returned function **never rejects**: `Button` auto-pends off a returned
 * thenable but attaches only `.finally()`, so a rejection would escape as an
 * unhandled rejection. It awaits only the inventory read (so the button pends
 * while we find out what is at stake, rather than rendering "owns nothing"
 * before we know) and then hands off to the dialog, which owns its own lifetime,
 * its own error display and its own retry.

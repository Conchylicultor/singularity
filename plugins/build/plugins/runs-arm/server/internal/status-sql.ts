 * This is the one genuinely duplicated rule in the arm, and it is duplicated for
 * a reason that cannot be designed away here: the union query has to decide a
 * row's status *in Postgres*, inside an `ORDER BY`-able projection, so a
 * TypeScript predicate over a fetched row is not available at the point the
 * decision is needed. Two encodings of one rule is a drift hazard, so:
 *
 * - Both read the SAME exported constants. Nothing is re-typed as a literal, so
 *   the numbers cannot drift even if the branches do.
 * - `status-sql.test.ts` drives a table of `(finishedAt, exitCode)` samples —
 *   every branch, and both sides of every boundary — through the TypeScript
 *   function and through this expression on a real Postgres, and asserts they
 *   agree. A branch that drifts fails that suite.
 *
 * Branch order matters and mirrors the function exactly. Note the NULL
 * behaviour is load-bearing on the last comparison: `null > 128` is NULL in SQL,
 * which falls through to `else 'failed'` — the same answer as the function's
 * `exitCode !== null &&` guard, reached a different way.

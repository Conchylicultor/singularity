/**
 * The anti-drift suite for the one rule this arm has to write twice.
 *
 * `buildStatusOf` (TypeScript, over a fetched row) and `buildStatusExpr` (SQL,
 * inside the union's projection) decide the same thing about the same two
 * fields. Nothing in the type system can tie a `case … end` string to a chain of
 * `if`s, so this is the strongest available guard: every branch of the rule, and
 * both sides of every boundary it draws, driven through BOTH encodings on a real
 * Postgres and asserted equal.
 *
 * The expression is evaluated over parameters rather than over `build_runs`, so
 * the suite needs no table, no migration chain and no fixture rows — only a
 * server that can answer `SELECT`. That is also why `buildStatusExpr` takes its
 * two columns as arguments instead of closing over the table.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/build/plugins/runs-arm`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

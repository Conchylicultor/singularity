/**
 * A database with no `build_runs` table in it — the machine's VERY FIRST build.
 *
 * The base `singularity` database is created empty when the cluster starts, and
 * its schema arrives only when the backend restarts and migrates at the end of
 * the build that is running now. So the CLI's ledger write lands on a database
 * that exists and has no tables, and Postgres answers `42P01` where a
 * never-deployed checkout would have answered `3D000`. Both mean the same thing
 * — no ledger here yet — and both must degrade to the named `"unavailable"`
 * outcome rather than failing a build the ledger is only observing.
 *
 * `createTestDb()` hands back an UNMIGRATED database by construction: the
 * fixture applies schema only when the caller calls `runMigrations` itself (as
 * `stale-holder.test.ts` does). Not calling it IS the scenario.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/build/plugins/run-ledger`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

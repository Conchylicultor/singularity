// Settling a DEAD holder of `build_runs_inflight_uniq`, at the moment the lock
// is actually blocking someone.
//
// Only two paths in `./singularity build` close its own row (the ok verdict and
// the failure-verdict funnel). An early `process.exit`, a throw unwinding to
// `runCli`, a catchable signal and a SIGKILL all leave it open — and the exit
// hook cannot close it, because it runs only synchronous code and the close is a
// database write. The backend's supervised-run reconciler would reap it, but only
// on backend boot, and a failed build never restarts the backend. So the open row
// used to block every later build of the namespace until some build got far
// enough to restart it.
//
// The fix is that WHOEVER LOSES THE CLAIM decides whether the holder is dead,
// with the same rule the supervised reconciler applies (`settleRun`):
//
//   terminal = build's own terminal record ?? (run alive ? STILL RUNNING : hard kill -1)
//
// "Run alive" is `isRunAlive`: the holder pid OR its process group. A build the
// backend started is a supervised run whose row pid is the shim — the leader of
// the group the real `./singularity build` lives in — so a shim killed alone
// must not read as a dead holder. A plain CLI build's pid is covered by the
// pid half of the same probe.
//
// Race-safety: this runs only AFTER an insert lost to the index, and closes only
// a row whose build provably ended — a dead process does not come back. Two
// claimants settling the same row is harmless (the guarded UPDATE matches for
// one of them), and both retries go back through the index, which still picks
// exactly one winner. A recycled pid can only read as ALIVE, which is today's
// "lost" outcome, never a live build closed.
//
// Eval-safe for the CLI like the rest of this leaf: supervised-job/core touches
// no db and no jobs queue, and paths/core is node:os/node:path resolution only.

// claim-time settle in `stale-holder.ts`) — NO config_v2 / notifications /
// namespace-bound db / jobs queue / events.

  //
  // The reason is a hard ordering fact plus a drizzle behaviour that
  // together make the ORM form structurally unusable HERE:
  //
  //   1. This row is minted by the `./singularity build` CLI
  //      (bin/commands/build.ts, just before `generateAppSources`), which
  //      GENERATES the migration; the migration is not APPLIED until the
  //      backend restarts at the very end of the build. So the CLI always
  //      runs NEW code against the schema the PREVIOUS build left behind.
  //
  //   2. `db.insert(table).values({…})` names EVERY column in the drizzle
  //      table definition and passes DEFAULT for the ones the caller
  //      omitted. Measured with `.toSQL()`:
  //
  //        insert into "build_runs"
  //          ("id","trigger","commit_hash","namespace","targets",
  //           "started_at","finished_at","exit_code","pid")
  //        values ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5,default,default,default,$6)
  //
  //      Omitting a field does NOT keep its column out of the statement.
  //
  // So the rule is about the TABLE, not the field: the CLI cannot use the
  // ORM insert on a table whose drizzle definition has gained ANY column
  // the deployed schema lacks. The next column added here would break this
  // write again the moment it is added — the statement below cannot, because
  // it names its own columns and grows only when a human adds one, one
  // release AFTER the migration that creates it has been applied. That
  // ordering is the whole discipline: add the column, deploy, then name it.
  // (`targets` is the column that taught us this, at the cost of two failed
  // builds; it is deployed now, so it is named.)
  //
  // Parameterised (drizzle's `sql` template emits $n placeholders), never
  // concatenated.
  //
  // `targets` MUST go through `sql.param()`. An array interpolated bare
  // into a `sql` template is drizzle's `in (…)` list form — it expands to
  // one placeholder PER ELEMENT wrapped in parens, so `${r.targets}` emits
  // `($5, $6)`, a row expression, and Postgres rejects it with
  // `42804 column "targets" is of type text[] but expression is of type
  // record`. `sql.param()` binds the whole array as ONE parameter, which
  // node-postgres serialises to a Postgres array literal; the placeholder's
  // type is then inferred from the target column, so no `::text[]` cast is
  // needed. Both forms were measured with `.toSQL()` and round-tripped
  // against the deployed table.

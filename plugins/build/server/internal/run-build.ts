 * install, one codegen, one checks pass, one transcript, one `build_runs` row
 * with N chips. Rebuilding three drifted compositions is therefore one enqueue,
 * not three queued behind each other's `.build.lock`.
 *
 * **`.min(1)` rather than a thrown guard at the top of a function.** An empty set
 * is a caller bug, not "build the main app": it would spawn `--composition` with
 * no ids and mint a row whose `targets` is `{}` — a run that is an attempt for
 * nothing, so no composition's termination clause could ever see it. The schema
 * is parsed at `.enqueue()`, which is where the caller is, so the mistake is
 * unspellable rather than merely rejected inside a detached child.

/**
 * Auto-build is a CONVERGENCE loop on "this checkout's HEAD is what is
 * deployed", not a queue of push events. `triggerBuild` DROPS a request that
 * arrives while a build is in flight — and a push landing mid-build is precisely
 * when one does — so the request cannot be remembered, it has to be re-derived.
 * This is that re-derivation.
 *
 * **It takes no argument.** That is the whole point. The old design carried a
 * baseline (the commit the finished build was for) from the caller that started
 * the build to the caller that saw it end — but on a main auto-build those are
 * not the same process: the build restarts the very backend that spawned it, so
 * the baseline died with it. Here there is nothing to carry, so nothing can be
 * lost.
 *
 * Called at five edges — the target moving (`buildRunJob`, on the durable
 * `refAdvanced` trigger), a build reaching terminal (the supervised-run kind's
 * `finish`, in `run-state.ts`), this backend starting (`onReady`), the
 * `compositions` config changing, and the `build.composition-tick` cron.
 *
 * The terminal edge used to be TWO — `triggerBuild`'s `finally` for a build
 * whose starting backend survived, and `watchInflightBuild`'s `settle` for one
 * it did not. A build restarts the backend that spawned it, so the first almost
 * never fired; they are now one callback the supervised-run supervisor invokes
 * from whichever backend is alive when the exit marker lands.
 *
 * Because the decision is stateless and idempotent (the
 * `build_runs_inflight_uniq` partial index already makes a redundant trigger a
 * no-op), an extra edge is free and a missed edge degrades to "converges at the
 * next edge". Under the old design every net was load-bearing, which is why all
 * three failing at once produced a permanent miss (2026-08-19).
 *
 * The loop now covers the compositions this checkout SERVES as well as its own
 * app: a served namespace runs the dist and the server tree of whatever commit
 * last happened to build it, so without this it drifts silently. It converges by
 * the same mechanism and inherits the same guarantees — the two extra edges
 * above exist only because a cadence has no push to hang off, and the last
 * clause the compositions add is a rate limit, never a queue.

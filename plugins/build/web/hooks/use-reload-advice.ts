/**
 * Whether this tab should be reloaded, and why. Every reason has one answer
 * (reload), so they are one signal:
 *
 * - `stale` — the server now serves a different frontend than the one this tab
 *   is running.
 * - `outdated` — the server refused `count` of this tab's live resources as a
 *   contract mismatch judged `skew`: this bundle asks for data in a shape the
 *   server no longer speaks, so those reads cannot load until a reload. It is
 *   stronger than `stale` (something is already failing), so it wins;
 *   `stale` rides along.
 * - `broken` — at least one plugin failed to load in this tab, so part of the
 *   app is missing until a reload re-fetches it. The strongest reason, so it
 *   wins over both; `stale` rides along (an outdated tab is stale too) so the
 *   copy can name both.
 *
 * A plugin that failed during the background (deferred) tier shows NO banner —
 * this is its only app-wide surface. Core-stage failures land in the same set
 * and additionally keep their boot banner. Likewise a resource refused for
 * skew renders only its own failed read; this is what says "reload".

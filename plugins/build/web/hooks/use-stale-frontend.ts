// pin in the deployment description. Fires even for a tab that *loaded* an
// already-stale `index.html`, because the comparison is between two identities
// of the bytes rather than between two moments in time.
//
// The graph hash is a function of the composed module graph, so a rebuild that
// changed nothing republishes the same value and no tab is asked to reload — the
// per-run build id this replaced was new on every build by construction.
//
// The `baked !== "dev"` guard keeps it inert wherever the global is not injected
// (a dev server), where an absent pin would otherwise read as a permanent
// mismatch.

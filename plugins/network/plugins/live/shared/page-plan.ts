// The paged read's plan, as pure data — `useLiveCollectionPages` feeds it what each

// A page is a KEY RANGE read with a limit: `(after, until]` in the order, at
// most `limit` rows. The pages tile the order (each page's `after` is the
// previous one's `until`; exactly the last has `until: null`). One structural
// operation keeps them small — SPLIT a full page at a row's key — and one
// keeps them few — MERGE two small neighbours. Liveness follows the viewport:
// a page near what is on screen is subscribed, one far from it is released
// and keeps showing the rows it last held (stale) — up to a STALE BUDGET of
// rows per reader, past which a released page drops its rows and is drawn as
// one height-keeping placeholder, subscribed again once it is near the
// viewport. Depth is unbounded; what is live is bounded by the viewport, and
// what is held by the viewport plus the budget.

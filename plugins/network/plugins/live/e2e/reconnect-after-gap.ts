/**
 * A reconnect after a subscription gap replays a FRESH value, end to end on a
 * deployed build.
 *
 * The bug (research/2026-09-27-global-live-substrate-gaps.md, gap 1): the
 * live-state server used to answer a reconnecting tab's replay with
 * `up-to-date`/`up-to-date-batch` from memory even when the truth changed
 * while the tab's WebSocket was down and nobody else was subscribed — the
 * per-pk version counter it compared against was never bumped for an
 * untracked tuple, so an echoed version could still match. The fix
 * (`registerSubOnSocket` in resource-runtime/core/runtime.ts) makes every
 * subscription span open with a FRESH version on the global 0→1 transition,
 * so a replay that arrives after the old socket's `close` was processed can
 * never short-circuit — it always takes the full path and gets a real
 * `sub-ack`.
 *
 * Resource under test: the notifications bell's `notifications` collection
 * (`plugins/shell/plugins/notifications`) — a `liveCollection` window
 * (bounded, DB-backed, preloaded at boot), changeable from outside the page
 * with one HTTP call (`POST /api/notifications`), harmless and reversible
 * (the created row is dismissed in a `finally`).
 *
 * Mechanism: the shared socket's e2e tap (`tapSharedSocket`,
 * `@plugins/primitives/plugins/networking/e2e`) — the socket lives in a
 * SharedWorker, out of Playwright's `routeWebSocket` reach — so the app behaves
 * normally except for the one thing this script controls:
 *
 *   1. drop the connection (`tap.drop`) — the backend sees a real close and
 *      releases the tab's subs, ending the tracking span for every tuple it
 *      held;
 *   2. HOLD the reconnect — `tap.hold` (armed before the drop) parks every new
 *      connection attempt in the worker until `tap.release`;
 *   3. make the HTTP change while the reconnect is held, wait ~1s, then
 *      release;
 *   4. assert the page shows the change within a few seconds, and record
 *      which frame answered the `notifications` replay on the new connection
 *      — the fixed server must answer `sub-ack` (fresh data), never
 *      `up-to-date-batch`.
 *
 * WRITES: creates one notification via the app's own endpoint and dismisses
 * it in a `finally`, whatever the run's outcome.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/network/plugins/live/e2e/reconnect-after-gap.ts [--headed]

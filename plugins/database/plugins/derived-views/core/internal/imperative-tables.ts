// Public tables created imperatively (outside drizzle's tracked schema), so they
// are NOT present in the drizzle snapshot. The `orphaned-db-tables` check treats
// these as declared, and the sites that create them reference these constants so
// the allowlist can never drift from reality.
//
// That last invariant is STATICALLY ENFORCED by the `imperative-create-table-
// allowlisted` check (plugins/database/plugins/migrations/check/): every real-code
// `CREATE TABLE` must name one of the IMPERATIVE_PUBLIC_TABLES constants on its
// line, so an unallowlisted imperative table cannot land at the push gate (the
// DB-side orphaned-db-tables check only catches it later, on a reachable DB). To
// add an imperative table: add its name constant below, add it to the
// IMPERATIVE_PUBLIC_TABLES record BY SHORTHAND (`{ MY_TABLE }`, never
// `{ ALIAS: MY_TABLE }` — see that record's doc comment), and interpolate that
// constant on the CREATE TABLE line at the create site.
//
// This list is for tables in the REAL worktree DB only. A test that just needs a
// scratch table must NOT be added here: provision a throwaway database with
// `createTestDb` (@plugins/database/plugins/db-test-fixture/server) and create the
// table on that instead. Such a database is dropped in teardown and is never what
// orphaned-db-tables scans, so the check exempts those create sites — while an
// entry here would make orphaned-db-tables treat a test fixture's name as declared
// schema of a database it does not exist in.
//
// Lives in the derived-views CORE leaf — the shared sink every consumer already
// depends on (migrations → derived-views, change-feed → derived-views,
// database/server → derived-views, and the migrations check). It is deliberately
// NOT in `@plugins/database/core`: importing that from migrations/derived-views
// server code (which `database/server` depends on) would close a cross-plugin
// import cycle. The derived-views core leaf has no such back-edge.
//
// Pure module: no imports that pull in a DB pool, so it stays import-safe for
// tooling/check subprocesses (where SINGULARITY_WORKTREE is unset).

 *     the constant on its `CREATE TABLE` line (the table name itself never
 *     appears there).
 *   - `table-defs-in-schema-glob` — a `pgTable(...)` READ handle outside the

 * TEXT, with two independently hand-rolled array-literal parsers that could
 * silently disagree. Writing each entry as shorthand (`{ FOO }`, not
 * `{ BAR: FOO }`) is what makes each key the identifier a call site must spell,
 * so the names are declared data instead of a parse.
 *
 * `imperative-create-table-allowlisted` PROVES the shorthand invariant: every

 * value. A non-shorthand entry — or a constant missing from the barrel every
 * create site imports it from — fails there, loudly, at the push gate.

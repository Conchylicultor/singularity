// REVERSE dependency order (dependents before dependencies) and recreate in
// forward dependency order (dependencies before dependents) so Postgres never
// rejects a drop for an existing dependent or a create for a missing source.
//
// The whole thing runs in one transaction inside `onReadyBlocking` (before the
// server-ready barrier, no traffic yet): any failure throws and blocks boot
// loudly rather than serving against a half-rebuilt view layer.
//
// `db` is passed in (like runMigrations) so this module never imports
// @plugins/database/server — that would form a cycle (database/server calls us).
//
// `views` is passed in too, never read from `View.getContributions()` here. That
// table is filled only by a booted backend's `collectContributions`; a process
// that never boots (the `migration-applies-clean` check) gathers the same set
// from the server barrels instead. Reading it here made the check's dry-run
// rebuild zero views and pass without testing any.
//
// SKIP WHEN UNCHANGED. The DROP+CREATE holds an AccessExclusive lock over each
// view until commit. During a hot-swap restart the *previous* backend is still
// serving reads of those same views against the same DB, so the exclusive
// window deadlocked concurrent readers (the tasks loader, the allow-files poll
// — see the per-query deadlock retry in database/server). The view layer is a
// pure function of source, so we fingerprint the compiled DDL and skip the
// rebuild entirely when it matches what is already live — removing the lock
// window from the steady-state restart path. The rebuild (and its brief
// deadlock risk) now only runs on a genuine view edit, not every restart.

// STRING, and which this query casts to `text` anyway; the value is compared as a
// BigInt below, never as a number. `op` is a `char(1)` whose only three writers
// are the trigger function's I/U/D, so the enum is the check that was previously
// a bare assertion. `ids` is the one genuinely nullable column: a bulk statement
// with no single-column PK writes NULL, which the replay routes as FULL.
//
// `keys` / `unchanged` are a routed table's key layout and known-unchanged
// column set — written by `live_state_notify_routed()` exactly as it NOTIFYs
// them, and NULL for every other table. `keys` is `jsonb` (decoded to its object), parsed by
// the same reader as the live payload so the replay routes exactly what the
// NOTIFY would have.

// true by construction and prevents drift, and THAT INVARIANT requires preserving
// `row.ids` for every op (the live listener never strips them). A genuinely id-less
// bulk statement still arrives with `row.ids === null` → FULL; a legacy entry
// recomputes in FULL regardless of ids (`applyLegacyFullChange`); a routed entry
// gains the same scoped delivery it gets on the live path.

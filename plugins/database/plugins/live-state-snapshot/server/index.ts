Two persist modes (a FULL recompute replaces; a persisted alias's trailing window lowers the floor), an hourly compact job, and a boot catch-up that seeds each persisted alias from its row and replays the changelog by scope — or, when history was pruned past the floor or a rollup was healed, recomputes every persisted key.",

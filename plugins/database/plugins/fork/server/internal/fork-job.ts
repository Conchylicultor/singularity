// exists) and atomic-publish, so a retry is safe; `runAttempts: 5` retries a
// failed fork with a durable backoff (~3, 7, 20, 55 s) between attempts.

// Lives in its own `database/fork` plugin rather than `database/admin` because
// `infra/jobs` already depends on `database/admin` (for `connectionString`);

// A throwaway, isolated database on the ALREADY-RUNNING gateway-owned cluster,
// for DB-backed test suites. The whole value of these tests is running the REAL
// SQL (triggers, NOTIFY, xid8 monotonicity, ON CONFLICT upsert, text[] round-trip,
// replay ordering) against a real Postgres — a fake `db` would prove nothing — so
// we provision an isolated database via admin's public barrel (the same primitives
// forkDatabase / the backup sources use), hand back a drizzle handle plus a raw
// libpq connection string, and drop the database after.
//
// `drop()` is the FAST path, not the guarantee. It runs in the suite's `afterAll`
// and so reclaims the database on every path the process survives — and on no
// other. The backstop for a killed run is the name itself: it is minted through
// `mintTestDbName`, which stamps it disposable and dated, and the
// `database.test-db-sweep` job (db-test-fixture/plugins/sweep) reclaims what a
// dead process left behind. See `../../core/internal/scratch-name.ts`.

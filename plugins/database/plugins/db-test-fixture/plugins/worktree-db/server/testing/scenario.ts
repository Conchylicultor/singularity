 * union is a property of drizzle's own `transaction` signature, not of tasks.
 *
 * It is deliberately the wide union and not the narrow `db.transaction`
 * callback arm. A batch (`runStatusBatchOn`) hands its own callback the union,
 * so a scenario body typed to the narrow arm cannot be handed the batch's
 * executor — which is exactly how the two copied-by-hand harnesses this one

 * CALLER's connection and so ASSUMES the schema rather than installing it. A
 * database that has never hosted a booted backend has none, and the failure is
 * a bare Postgres `3F000` that names nothing in this repo. That is precisely
 * how four tasks-core tests were failing.
 *
 * A worktree database no longer arrives in that state — the fork keeps
 * graphile's migration watermark (`ExcludeSchemaDataFromFork({ schema:
 * "graphile_worker", keep: ["migrations"] })` in jobs' server barrel), so it is
 * born queue-capable. This gate stays because it is cheap (one connect, one
 * SELECT) and because it is the harness's job to state its own precondition
 * rather than inherit one from how the database happened to be provisioned —
 * a hand-made database, a graphile version bump, or a future provisioning path
 * all land here.
 *
 * A rejection is deliberately NOT cached: the usual cause is a cluster that is
 * not up yet, and a second run in the same process should get a real attempt
 * rather than a replayed corpse of the first one.

 * statement fails with "current transaction is aborted" instead of doing what
 * the test asked. So a case whose failure mode is a constraint violation or a
 * bad cast needs its own savepoint — do not simply add it to a scenario.

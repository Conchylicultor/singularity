/**
 * Reclaims throwaway test databases whose test process died before its
 * `afterAll` could drop them.
 *
 * This is the backstop half of the fixture's lifetime. `createTestDb`'s `drop()`
 * is what runs on the normal path; it cannot run at all when the run is killed,
 * and before this job existed nothing else ever did — five killed runs over two
 * weeks in August 2026 left seven databases on the shared cluster, still there a
 * month later, invisible to every cleanup surface on the host because their
 * names told nobody what they were.
 *
 * TWO independent conditions, and a candidate needs both:
 *
 *   1. The name parses as one this fixture minted (`__testdb`). Nothing else
 *      mints that suffix, so this can never match a real namespace — and a
 *      suffixed name that does NOT parse throws rather than being skipped, since
 *      it means the grammar has torn.
 *   2. It is past its TTL *and* has no active connections. Either alone is
 *      unsafe: a fresh mint is briefly connection-less between `ensureDatabase`
 *      and the pool opening, and a suite paused under a debugger is old but very
 *      much alive.
 *
 * EVERY DROP FILES A REPORT. A sweep that deletes quietly is indistinguishable
 * from data going missing, and the facts worth keeping (which suite, which pid)
 * live in the name, which the drop destroys — so the report is both the receipt
 * and the only surviving evidence. Deduped per suite, so a burst collapses onto
 * one row whose count grows.
 *
 * Main-runtime only (no `perWorktree`) and `singleton` — databases are a global
 * cluster resource, so one sweep covers every worktree, exactly as
 * `database.fork-temp-sweep` does for `__forking` temps.

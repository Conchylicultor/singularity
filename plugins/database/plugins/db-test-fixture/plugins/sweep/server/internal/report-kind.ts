/**
 * The `test-database-leaked` report kind: **a test run died, and the sweep just
 * cleaned up after it.**
 *
 * WHY A REPORT AND NOT A LOG LINE. Dropping a database is a destructive act; a
 * destructive act nobody is told about is indistinguishable from data quietly
 * going missing. `removal-audit` states the same rule from the other direction —
 * *"a durable line in a JSONL nobody opens is exactly how 22 deleted checkouts
 * went unnoticed for a week"* — and that was for something the app did not even
 * do itself. This sweep DOES the deletion, so it owes a receipt.
 *
 * The report is also the only surviving evidence: the database is gone, and its
 * name (which carried the suite and the pid) went with it.
 *
 * Deduped per `prefix`, because that is the unit anyone acts on — "the
 * page_forest_test suite's runs keep being killed" is one problem, not N.
 *
 * Variant `warning`, not `error`: the sweep working is the system working. What
 * it reveals — a test run being killed rather than finishing — is the thing
 * worth a look, and it may well be a human pressing Ctrl+C, which is fine.
 *
 * NOT `duressExempt`. This is housekeeping, not an outage alarm; if the box is
 * in trouble, shedding this is exactly right — the condition is not urgent and
 * the next sweep re-files it.

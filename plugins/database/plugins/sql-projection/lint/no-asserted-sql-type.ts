/**
 * no-asserted-sql-type
 *
 * ``sql<T>`…` `` in a drizzle projection declares a type nothing produces. A raw
 * SQL expression carries `noopDecoder` — the identity function — so whatever the
 * driver decoded is handed to typed code as if it matched `T`. `tsc` is
 * satisfied, the code reads as typed, and a mismatch surfaces as WRONG
 * BEHAVIOUR, never as an error. It is the `pool.query<Row>(sql)` hole
 * (`sql-rows`) one layer down, inside the row rather than around it.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. `sql<Date | null>` over a `timestamptz` column really
 * delivers a `string`: `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` overrides the pg type parsers
 * so TIMESTAMPTZ / TIMESTAMP / DATE / INTERVAL arrive as their raw string,
 * leaving the mapping to drizzle's own column types — which a raw projection
 * does not have. Three of this repo's projections said `Date` and held a string;
 * two consumers had grown a `const toDate = (v) => v instanceof Date ? v : new
 * Date(v)` hedge around it, applied to every timestamp they touched.
 *
 * There is nothing to add for the *positive* case, which is what makes this
 * cheap: drop the type argument and an unmapped projection is `SQL<unknown>` —
 * honest, and unusable downstream without handling it. `tsc` already demands a
 * decoder the moment you want a usable type. The only thing that has to go is
 * the spelling that lets you name a type WITHOUT one, and there are two of them:
 *
 *   sql<T>`…`              the type argument on the tag
 *   sql`…`.as<T>("alias")  drizzle's deprecated SQL.as<TData>(), identical
 *
 * The second has zero occurrences in this repo today and is banned anyway, for
 * the reason `no-unparsed-sql-rows` keys on "rows were read" rather than "a
 * generic was written": a rule that closed only the first would push the next
 * author onto a spelling that is exactly as unsafe.
 *
 * No exemption by shape. ``sql<string>`count(*)` `` is true only by luck (int8
 * decodes to a string, int4 does not), and `.mapWith(String)` says the same
 * thing while making it true.
 *
 * NOT type-aware, matching the closest precedents (`no-unparsed-sql-rows`,
 * `no-raw-bun-spawn`, `no-narrow-zodtype`) — and self-contained by necessity: a
 * contributed rule file is loaded by jiti, which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*`
 * alias, so the rule can name no type from the repo.
 *
 * See research/2026-08-25-database-mapped-sql-projections.md.

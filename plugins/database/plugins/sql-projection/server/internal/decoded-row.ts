/**
 * `decodedRow` — a raw statement's row, decoded the way drizzle's builder
 * decodes a selected row.
 *
 * A builder query (`db.select({ … })`) decodes each field through its column
 * or its `.mapWith()` decoder (drizzle's `mapResultRow`). A raw statement
 * (`db.execute(sql`…`)`) — a union whose outer order keys are expressions, a
 * recursive CTE: shapes the builder cannot render — hands back the driver's
 * values UNDECODED: a `timestamptz` as its string, a `numeric` as text. The
 * projection that built the statement already knows each field's decoder, so
 * the row is decoded from the same declaration:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const rows = await executeRows(db, {
 *   query,                                            // SELECT … AS "id", … AS "createdAt"
 *   row: decodedRow({ id: tasks.id, createdAt: tasks.createdAt, label: String }),
 *   label: "runs.union",
 * });
 * //    ^? { id: string; createdAt: Date; label: string }[]
 * ```
 *
 * - **The exact key set** (A31 of
 *   research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md): a row
 *   missing a projected field, or carrying one the projection does not name,
 *   fails the parse — a statement and its projection that drifted apart (a
 *   renamed alias, a column a `SELECT *` grew) can never be read as a row with
 *   a silently absent or stray field.
 * - **A NULL skips the decoder**, as in drizzle's own mapping — but only where
 *   the field's type admits it: a column that is not NOT NULL (its type adds
 *   `| null`, as drizzle's select type does) or a `nullable(…)` decoder. Any
 *   other field (a NOT NULL column, `Number`, `parsed(…)`) types as non-null,
 *   so a NULL there is a zod issue on the field — never a `null` typed as a
 *   `Date`. (A union arm's typed-NULL column is how one gets there: declare
 *   the field `nullable(…)`.)
 *
 * A decoder that throws (`parsed`'s `SqlProjectionError`) propagates as is —
 * it names the projection; a key-set mismatch is a zod issue on the field,
 * which `sql-rows` reports with the result's column OID.

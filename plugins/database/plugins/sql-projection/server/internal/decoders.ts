/**
 * The two decoders that drizzle does not ship, and why each has to exist.
 *
 * In drizzle every *column* carries a decoder (`mapFromDriverValue`), so its
 * declared type and its runtime mapping come from the same object and cannot
 * disagree. A raw ``sql`…` `` projection is the one field kind whose decoder is
 * `noopDecoder` — the identity function — which is what makes ``sql<T>`…` `` a
 * pure assertion: whatever the driver produced is handed to typed code as if it
 * matched.
 *
 * `.mapWith(decoder)` is drizzle's own answer, and it is the right one:
 * `mapWith<TDecoder>(d): SQL<GetDecoderResult<TDecoder>>` **computes** the type
 * from the decoder, so the type cannot be chosen independently of the runtime
 * behaviour. What is missing from `.mapWith` alone is exactly two things:
 *
 *  - **nullability.** `GetDecoderResult<Column>` is the column's data type with
 *    no `| null`, and drizzle short-circuits `null` before ever calling a
 *    decoder (`utils.js` `mapResultRow`: `rawValue === null ? null : decode`).
 *    So a column decoder alone cannot spell `SQL<Date | null>` — {@link nullable}
 *    does, and its job is mostly type-level.
 *  - **checking a composite shape.** `Boolean` / `Number` / `String` coerce, and
 *    there is no coercion for "an array of strings" or "one of these six
 *    literals" — which is precisely the incident class: `array_agg` over a
 *    `name` column produces `name[]` (OID 1003), for which pg has no decoder, so
 *    the raw Postgres literal *string* arrives where `string[]` was declared.
 *    {@link parsed} is what catches that.
 *
 * A decoder can therefore make the declared **shape** true by construction, but
 * it can never police nullability — that stays the author's claim, spelled with
 * {@link nullable}.

// A plugin leaves ITS OWN table's ROWS out of the nightly backup by adding
// `ExcludeFromBackup({ table, reason })` to its server `contributions`. The
// archive keeps the table's DDL; a restore gives an empty table.
//
// A SEPARATE DECISION FROM `ExcludeFromFork` (./fork-exclusion), on purpose.
// The fork asks "does a fresh worktree need these rows?"; the backup asks "does
// losing these rows cost anything?". The answers often differ: `mail_sync_state`
// stays in every fork (a worktree still needs the account's sync state) yet is
// left out of backups, together with the Gmail corpus it watermarks. So neither
// token implies the other.
//
// A kept table must not have a foreign key to a left-out one: the restore would
// fail re-adding it, so the backup refuses (`BackupPlanError`, ./backup-plan).
// Leave the linking table out too, or replace the link with a plain id.
//
// `reason` MUST SAY ONE OF TWO THINGS:
//
//   - **The rows expire anyway.** `traces` is 7-day debugging evidence swept
//     nightly; a restore a week later would find it gone regardless.
//   - **How the rows come back.** A cache rebuilt from a file or an upstream
//     source (the chord trainer's song index reloads from its snapshot; the
//     mail corpus is refetched from Gmail by the next sync).
//
// Anything a human authored, or that nothing can rebuild, does not qualify.
// And because a restore hands the owning plugin an EMPTY table, that plugin
// must treat empty as a normal state (rebuild, or simply show nothing), never
// as corruption.
//
// Table-level only. Nothing needs a schema-level form today; it can be added the
// way the fork's was.

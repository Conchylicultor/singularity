 *
 * These statements do work proportional to a DATABASE, not to a row, and some
 * of it is waiting nobody here controls:
 *
 * - `CREATE DATABASE` copies its template block by block, and waits for the
 *   lock on the database object behind any other create / drop / rename.
 * - `DROP DATABASE … WITH (FORCE)` terminates the database's sessions and waits
 *   for them to exit, then removes every file of a database that can be
 *   gigabytes (a fork, a composition's data).
 * - `ALTER DATABASE … RENAME` waits for that same database-object lock — behind
 *   a sweep dropping the same temp, for instance.
 *
 * Under a loaded host (a build, forks and restores running at once) each can
 * legitimately outlast a minute. Ten minutes still turns a truly silent
 * connection into a report instead of a fork job that holds its slot for hours.

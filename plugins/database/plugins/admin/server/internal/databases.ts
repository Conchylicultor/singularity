 * Two producers, both of which build the whole name out of hex/base-36 and
 * underscores, and both of which end the name with the suffix that names the
 * sweep responsible for reclaiming it: `forkTempName`
 * (`f_<sha8>_<rand8>__forking`, swept by `database.fork-temp-sweep`) and
 * `mintTestDbName` (`<prefix>_<pid>_<base36>__testdb`, swept by
 * `database.test-db-sweep`). A scratch database that no sweep can recognise is
 * one nothing ever reclaims, so the suffix is not decoration — it is the whole
 * of each sweeper's admission test. Capped at 63 like a namespace, and for the
 * same reason — Postgres truncates `datname` at 63 bytes silently, so a longer
 * name addresses a database other than the one it spells.
 *
 * A separate arm rather than a widened single regex: these are not namespaces
 * and must never be routable as one, and keeping them apart is what lets the app
 * arm below BE `NAMESPACE_RE` rather than a superset of it.

// A DEDICATED host-wide gate for the DB fork's `pg_dump | pg_restore` pipeline —
// until this gate, the fork was the ONLY heavy launch step with zero admission
// control (the job pool alone permitted 4 concurrent dump|restore pairs).
//
// Why a gate at all when the dump/restore CLIENTS are darwinbg-demoted
// (spawn-priority): the heavy server-side work — COPY parsing, index builds —
// runs inside Postgres backends, children of the postmaster, which our spawn
// demotion cannot reach. Bounding concurrent forks caps that un-demotable
// work at ~`size` cores. Size 2 keeps a single/double launch flowing while a
// launch storm queues (attributed, see below) instead of stacking restores.
//
// The acquire-wait is charged to the enclosing profiler entry (the
// `database.fork` job span) as the named `db-fork-acquire` layer, and the gate
// registers a gauge — mirroring worktree-mutate + host-read-pool — so added
// queueing shows up attributed in get_runtime_profile / slow-ops / the flight
// recorder, never as anonymous slowness.
// See research/2026-07-07-global-background-work-priority-isolation.md.
//
// Size + CPU cost are declared ONCE in host-admission/core's reserved-pool table
// (size 2), so this pool and the `host-budget` check read the same numbers. NO
// env override: `size` names the flock SLOT FILES, so it MUST be identical in
// every process — a constant (or a pure function of stable host facts) is what
// prevents a mis-sized process from silently exceeding the bound.
const { size: forkSize, cost } = RESERVED_POOLS["db-fork"];

// The `db-fork-acquire` occupancy gauge is auto-registered by `defineHostPool`
// with TRUE host-wide occupancy.
const gate = defineHostPool({ id: "db-fork", size: forkSize, cost });

// `signal` is optional and ambient — the `database.fork` job passes its
// `ctx.signal`. It cancels a pending acquire and, once held, releases the slot as
// soon as the body is abandoned rather than when it finally settles.
//
// The second half is only honest because `forkDatabase` kills the dump/restore
// children on the same abort: releasing a gate while the heavy work it bounds
// keeps running would silently put that work outside the bound. Whoever passes a
// signal here owes the same to whatever it spawns.

// Atomic publish: the fork populates a per-invocation temp DB (unique name from
// forkTempName) and the LAST step renames it to the canonical `<target>`. The
// canonical name therefore only ever exists once the fork fully completed — an
// interrupted fork leaves at most a disposable temp, never a half-baked
// canonical DB.
//
// Lock-free concurrency: each invocation forks its OWN unique temp, so two
// concurrent callers never clobber each other; the final RENAME arbitrates
// (first writer wins, losers drop their temp). No advisory lock or semaphore.
//
// Idempotent: a completed fork (canonical exists) is a no-op. This is the
// precondition that makes durable retry (the `database.fork` job) safe.
//
// `exclusions` is REQUIRED rather than read from the contribution registry here.
// `getContributions()` answers `[]` in any process that never booted the server,
// so a registry read inside this function would make `./singularity db fork`
// silently produce a full ~2 GB fork that looks like it worked. A required
// parameter forces every caller to name where its exclusion set came from; see
// `forkExclusions()` in ./fork-exclusion, which fails loudly on the empty case.
// `signal` is optional and ambient (no current caller passes one: the
// `database.fork` job runs detached with no deadline). It cancels the host
// `db-fork` acquire, and once the slot is held it kills whichever of
// dump/restore is running, the temp DB is dropped, and the call throws
// `signal.reason`. That ordering is the point — the temp is reclaimed BEFORE the
// abort is reported, so cancelling a fork never trades a released gate slot for
// a leaked `f_*__forking` database.

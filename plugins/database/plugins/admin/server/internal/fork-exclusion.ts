// A plugin opts ITS OWN table's ROWS out of the worktree DB fork by adding
// `ExcludeFromFork({ table, reason })` to its server `contributions`. The table
// is created in the forked DB with its full DDL but no rows.
//
// WHEN TO USE THIS — and the trade you are making. A worktree DB is forked from
// main so an agent starts with the tasks, conversations and pages it needs to do
// its job. Excluding a table says "a fresh worktree has no use for main's rows
// here, and will never re-populate them." That is the correct trade for two
// kinds of table:
//
//   - **Host-local observability.** Traces, slow-op aggregates, crash reports,
//     model-call logs, notifications. These record what happened on the machine
//     that produced them; an inherited row is at best noise in the fork's own
//     debug pane and at worst a phantom (main's undismissed notifications
//     appearing in a fresh worktree's bell). They are also, by volume, most of
//     the fork — `traces` alone is 949 MB of a 2057 MB source database.
//   - **Derived state rebuilt on boot.** The live-state snapshot + changelog are
//     a cold-boot accelerator; `boot-init.ts` degrades to a full recompute when
//     they are absent.
//
// It is the WRONG trade for anything a human authored or an agent must read.
// `reason` is required so the decision is a reviewed, documented one rather than
// a silent data-loss footgun — the exclusion is invisible until someone wonders
// why a table in their fork is empty.
//
// EXCLUDE DERIVED STATE TOGETHER WITH ITS SOURCES. A persisted live-state value
// is computed FROM other tables; keeping the snapshot while emptying a table it
// read makes the fork serve a value that disagrees with the rows behind it. That
// is why `live_state_snapshot` and `live_state_changelog` are excluded alongside
// the observability tables rather than kept as an optimisation.
//
// This token lives in `database/admin` rather than beside the fork JOB in
// `database/fork` because `database/fork` imports `shell/notifications` (to
// report a failed fork) and `shell/notifications` is itself a declaring plugin —
// hosting the token there would close a cycle. `admin` reaches only two leaf
// plugins, so no declaring plugin can ever cycle back into it.
//
// Collected by the framework at boot before any `onReadyBlocking` runs (same as
// the `View` and `ExcludeFromChangeFeed` contributions), so the fork job sees
// every exclusion regardless of module import order.

// Schemas a plugin's runtime creates for ITSELF rather than declaring as drizzle
// tables — a job queue's bookkeeping, a sync engine's replication state.
// Inheriting their CONTENTS is not merely wasteful, it is wrong: the rows
// describe the producing database.
//
// THE DECLARATION STATES WHAT SURVIVES, NOT WHAT GOES. The schema's DDL is
// always kept and its rows are always dropped; `keep` names the few tables whose
// rows come across anyway. There is deliberately no way to spell "remove the
// schema itself":
//
//   - Nothing can be left dangling. Publications and event triggers are
//     database-level objects that `pg_dump` emits regardless, and each one
//     naming a now-missing schema is a `pg_restore` error. Zero is exactly that
//     case — its `_zero_metadata_0` publication and `zero_ddl_*_0` event
//     triggers live outside its schemas and point back in — and removing the
//     schemas broke the restore on seven statements.
//   - Nothing is born incomplete. A schema that is deleted needs an owner to put
//     it back, and "who recreates it" has no spelling in a contribution — it was
//     prose in a `reason` string. `graphile_worker` is what that cost: a
//     freshly-forked database could not accept a transactional job enqueue until
//     a backend had booted against it.
//
// `keep` is what makes dropping the schema unnecessary. Graphile records its
// migration watermark in `graphile_worker.migrations`, INSIDE the schema; empty
// every table and graphile boots believing it is unmigrated and re-issues
// `CREATE TABLE` against tables that already exist. Keeping that one table — and
// only that one — gives a fork a schema graphile already considers installed,
// with no inherited jobs and no inherited crontab watermarks.
//
// `keep: []` is required rather than optional: "nothing in this schema comes
// across" is the decision being asked for, and an omitted field is not a
// decision.
//
// `schema` is a glob (`zero*` matches the whole `zero`, `zero_0`, `zero_0/cdc`,
// `zero_0/cvr` family). It is matched by US against the source catalog, never by
// `pg_dump` — see ./fork-plan, which also refuses a schema no declaration
// matches at all.

// A drizzle table object is preferred over a magic string so a rename is

// EXISTS` rather than by a migration (the live-state snapshot + changelog),
// which have no table object to pass — the same reason `derived-tables`'
// contribution takes a string.
//
// That tsc-checked spelling is also why the two contributions above stay two,
// now that both only ever empty tables: `ExcludeFromFork` can take a table
// OBJECT because the table is ours, and `ExcludeSchemaDataFromFork` cannot,
// because a foreign runtime's schema has none. Merging them would mean giving up

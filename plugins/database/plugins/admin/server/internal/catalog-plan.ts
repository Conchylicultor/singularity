// Everything schema-level (globs, `keep`, unclaimed schemas) is a fork question

// `admin`, so a test edge back would close an R6 cycle).

/**
 * The shape of one catalog row, PARSED rather than asserted.

 * type `array_agg(relname)` produces, since `pg_class.relname` is `name`, not
 * `text`. So an uncast `array_agg` arrives as the RAW literal
 * `"{_private_jobs,migrations,…}"`: a string, which every array operation
 * accepts and silently misreads. `for (const t of tables)` walks it one
 * character at a time and emits `"graphile_worker"."_"`, `…"."p"`, …; every one
 * of those matches nothing, `pg_dump` says nothing, and the fork copies the
 * whole schema. That is the exact class of silent miss the planners exist to
 * remove, reintroduced one layer lower — and it survived a real fork, which is
 * how it was found.
 *
 * The `::text` casts below are the fix; the parse is what makes the fix
 * enforced rather than remembered. The read goes through `queryRows`, the one
 * door every raw-SQL row read in the repo takes, so a column that disagrees with
 * this schema names itself and its pg type OID.

//   - `{ into, outOf }` → only a change INTO one of `into` or OUT OF one of
//     `outOf`. Typed against the column's own value type by the declaring
//     side (entities' `TouchedBy`), so a misspelled value is a tsc error.
//   - `{ exceptKeys }` → a jsonb OBJECT column: any change of value other than
//     to the listed top-level keys (`(NEW.c - keys) IS DISTINCT FROM (OLD.c -
//     keys)`). For a presentation key riding inside a content payload (a page's
//     icon inside its block data) that must not count as an edit of the record.
//     The keys are typed against the column's object type, so only a key the
//     value can carry is accepted.

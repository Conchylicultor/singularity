// Abandoning a connection.
//
// A missed deadline means the connection's socket may be dead in a way `pg`
// cannot see — in the incident, its fd had been closed by someone else. By the
// time the deadline fires that fd NUMBER is free and probably reused by some
// other resource (a pipe, a temp file, another pg socket). Closing the client
// (`client.end()` → `stream.destroy()`, which pg-pool's `_remove` and
// `release(err)` always do, and which pg's and pg-pool's own
// `connectionTimeoutMillis` do too) would close THAT resource: a new victim per
// incident, possibly another pooled socket, so a cascade every deadline.
//
// So the client is ABANDONED: detached from its pool, never closed. The cost for
// a call that was merely slow is one leaked server connection; a late reply can
// only resolve an already-settled call, a no-op, because nothing hands the
// client out again.

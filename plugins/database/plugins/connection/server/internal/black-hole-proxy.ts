// Test support: a call whose bytes vanish, against a REAL Postgres.
//
// The incident the deadline guards
// (research/2026-09-11-global-live-updates-frozen-by-stray-fd-close.md) is a
// call whose bytes disappear: the socket stays "open" from pg's side, no
// `error`/`end` ever arrives, and the promise waits forever. This proxy
// reproduces exactly that — a TCP server in front of the cluster whose
// forwarding can be switched off, so bytes are swallowed rather than refused.
// Switched off BEFORE a connection opens, it accepts the TCP connection and
// never answers the startup packet: a connect that hangs.
//
// Exported so a suite that owns a connection (the job queue's enqueue pool, …)
// can prove its own wiring carries the deadline, without a copy of this.

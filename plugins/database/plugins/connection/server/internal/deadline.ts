// waited forever.

 *   `phase` is `connect` (opening it) or `query` (a statement on it).
 *   `sql` is the query's label exactly as its `<sql>` profiler span records it,
 *   or `[connect]` for the connect phase; `origin` is the innermost
 *   runtime-profiler entry that issued the call (a resource, route or job
 *   label), `null` when context-less (boot, migrations); `reason` is the
 *   enclosing `withQueryDeadline` scope's reason, `null` under the default bound.
 * - `abandon-cap` — an abandon (on `pool`) landed after `cap` connections were
 *   already being held; this one is detached but no longer retained (see
 *   `abandonClient`). `abandoned` counts every abandon since boot.
 *
 * `at` is epoch ms (`Date.now()`).

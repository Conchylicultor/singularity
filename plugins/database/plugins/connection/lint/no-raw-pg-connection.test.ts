/**
 * Tests for the `no-raw-pg-connection` lint rule.
 *
 * Backend code must build every database connection through the connection
 * plugin, so each call carries a deadline. The rule flags `new Pool` /
 * `new Client` from "pg" in every import shape, and a `connectionString` handed
 * to graphile-worker (which would build its own raw pool) — outside the
 * connection plugin, tooling directories and tests.

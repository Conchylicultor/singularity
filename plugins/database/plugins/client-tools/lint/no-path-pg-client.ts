/**
 * no-path-pg-client
 *
 * The Postgres client tools are vendored (plugins/database/plugins/client-tools),
 * built from the same release as the embedded server. Spawning one by bare
 * name looks it up on the PATH instead: that silently needs a system Postgres
 * install (it is what made Homebrew a prerequisite), and gets whatever version
 * that install is — an 18.6 client once ran against the 18.3 cluster.
 *
 * Flags a string literal `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` / `pg_dumpall` as the FIRST
 * element of an array literal passed straight to a function call — the argv
 * shape every spawn helper takes (`spawnCaptured(["pg_dump", …])`,
 * `Bun.spawn([…])`, `backgroundArgv([…])`). The fix is `pgClientBin("pg_dump")`.
 *
 * Only a call argument: a list of tool NAMES (`const TOOLS = ["pg_dump", …]`,
 * `new Set([…])`) runs nothing and is not a PATH lookup.

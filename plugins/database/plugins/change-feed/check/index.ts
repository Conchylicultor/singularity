    "Every write to a table with a change producer (`defineChangeProducer`) goes through the producer's `mutate` — the only write that reaches live readers, since a produced table has no trigger. Flags a drizzle insert / update / delete on the table's binding (under any alias) that is not the builder a producer's `mutate` callback returns, and a raw SQL write (insert / update / delete / truncate / merge) naming the table. Test fixtures are out of scope and the migration runner is exempt (migrations' `exempt/index.ts`). See research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8.md (A11).",

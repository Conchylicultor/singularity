// Route one change and record it as a `route` span labelled by the changed
// table, so Debug → Slow Ops and get_runtime_profile can see the routing step
// between the change (Postgres's NOTIFY, or an in-process producer's flush) and
// the runtime's recompute.
//
// The duration is the synchronous routing work only (dependent-view lookup +
// `applyDbChange` for the table and each view). `sinceChangeMs` — the time from
// the trigger firing to routing done — is a measure, not the duration: it also
// counts how long the writing transaction stayed open after the statement,
// which is not routing's cost.
//
// A leaf span, not an entry: routing is synchronous and opens no child spans,
// and staying synchronous keeps a throwing route a thrown exception rather than
// a rejected promise.

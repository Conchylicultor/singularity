// Relation bases (C30 of research/2026-10-06-global-scoped-change-routing-p8-v3.md):
// the base tables a read of a relation depends on — the relations a write to
// which can change what the read returns.
//
//  - A base table is its own base.
//  - A view's bases are the union of the bases of every relation it reads
//    (`view_table_usage`, views-on-views followed transitively).
//  - A rollup (derived-tables) carries no trigger: a write to it is always
//    caused by a write to one of its sources, so its bases are its sources'.
//
// The bases are always base tables: a view or rollup is never its own base (no
// change is ever routed under its name), so `relationBases("agents_v")` is
// `["agents"]` and a base table's is itself.
//
// The graph is read once at boot, in change-feed's `onReadyBlocking` (after the
// derived-views and derived-tables layers committed), and is fixed for the
// process: the view set and the rollup set only change across a deploy. A read
// before it is set throws — a boot-order bug, never "no bases".
//
// Known limit: a view reading through a function body (plpgsql) is invisible to
// `view_table_usage`, so the tables that body reads are not among its bases.

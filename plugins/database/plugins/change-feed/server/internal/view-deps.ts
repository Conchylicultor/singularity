// Bridges the impedance mismatch between where changes ORIGINATE and where the
// read-set OBSERVES them. Triggers fire on base tables (you cannot put a row
// trigger on a view), but a legacy loader may read from the derived-views layer
// (`tasks_v`, `agents_v`, …) — so the L3 read-set records the VIEW name, not
// the base table.
//
// This module reads, once at boot (after derived-views are rebuilt), the
// forward view graph: each public view → the relations it DIRECTLY reads (a
// view reading another view is an edge here). `./relation-bases` expands it,
// transitively and through the rollups, into the base tables a read of each
// relation depends on.

// `information_schema.view_table_usage` types its name columns as the
// `sql_identifier` domain, which Postgres resolves to its base type on the wire —
// a scalar `name` (OID 19), which pg decodes to a string. Measured, not assumed.
//
// Both ends are filtered to `public`: the graph is keyed by bare name (as the
// read-set and the feed are), so a view reading another schema's same-named
// table must not be confused with the public one.

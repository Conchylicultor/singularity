// Boot-time invariant (A1′): every table a routed live-state resource's routes
// name has a change source — a table the change-feed ACTUALLY installs a
// trigger on, or one a mounted in-process change producer feeds (./producer).
//
// A ROUTED resource (`routes` / `reach`, compiler-emitted) is reached ONLY
// through its routes, so every route's table must fire, whatever its map. The
// change can only come from a table the change-feed put a trigger
// on (see ./triggers `coveredTables`) or whose producer emits it — the caller
// passes the union as `coveredTables`.
//
// WHY this is a bug, not a warning. If the named table has NO trigger — because
// it was excluded (ExcludeFromChangeFeed), is a feed-exempt derived-table rollup,
// is a VIEW name instead of its base table (the documented footgun in
// resource-runtime; a routed compiler also refuses a view `from` itself), or is a
// typo / dropped table — it never fires pg_notify, never appends a changelog row,
// never drives a recompute. So the declared delivery can never happen: the
// resource silently degrades to hydrate-on-mount while its declaration positively
// claims live scoping. Nothing else in the system reveals the mismatch — the
// read-set ceiling pane shows the resource as fully covered, because coverage is
// computed from the declaration, not from whether a trigger actually exists.
//
// The single authoritative question is "is the table in the set of tables we
// installed triggers on, or a produced one?" — which subsumes the ExcludeFromChangeFeed case AND
// catches the typo / view / rollup / nonexistent variants of the exact same
// dead-scope failure mode. We still classify each violation by WHY it is
// uncovered, because the remediations differ (an excluded table can have its
// exclusion dropped; a rollup must be keyed off its source; a typo/view is just a
// wrong string).
//
// This is the sibling of `warnOnCoverageGaps` (triggers.ts): both reconcile the
// change-feed against its consumers at boot because a static `./singularity check`
// can reach neither a live DB nor the server-only contribution/registry sets. This
// one THROWS (blocks boot) rather than warning, because a routed resource on an
// untriggered table is always a definite bug with a clear fix, never transient
// drift — the covered-tables set is exactly what `rebuildTriggers` just installed,
// so any real base table a resource legitimately reads is present by
// construction, and a miss is never a false positive.

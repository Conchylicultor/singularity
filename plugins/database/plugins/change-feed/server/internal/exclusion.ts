// A plugin opts ITS OWN table out of the L4 change-feed by adding
// `ExcludeFromChangeFeed({ table, reason })` to its server `contributions`.
// The change-feed installs no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE trigger on an excluded table,
// so a write never fires pg_notify, never appends a `live_state_changelog` row,
// and never drives a live-state recompute.
//
// WHEN TO USE THIS — and the trade you are making. The change-feed's value is
// that missed invalidations are *structurally impossible*: every committed write
// invalidates whatever live-state resource reads it, with zero hand-wiring. By
// excluding a table you give that up FOR THAT TABLE — any resource that reads it
// becomes hydrate-on-mount (it loads current truth when a client subscribes, but
// no longer live-updates while open). That is the correct trade for **high-churn
// observability counters read on open** (deduped slow-op aggregates that UPDATE a
// hot row thousands of times a minute): wiring per-statement live-UI invalidation
// onto them turns a debug pane nobody is staring at into the single largest
// source of changelog churn + notify cascade in the whole system — instrumentation
// that costs more than what it instruments. It is the WRONG trade for any table
// backing a user-facing live surface. `reason` is required so the decision is a
// reviewed, documented one, not a silent staleness footgun.
//
// Collected by the framework at boot BEFORE any onReadyBlocking runs (same as the
// `View` contribution), so `rebuildTriggers` sees every exclusion regardless of
// module import order.
//
// A LIVE surface over a high-churn table is not an exclusion: declare the table a
// change producer instead (`defineChangeProducer`, ./producer) — the backend that
// writes it routes each write itself, coalesced at the source, with no trigger,
// changelog row or NOTIFY. An exclusion is for a table read on mount only.
//
// INVARIANT (enforced at boot by ./route-coverage): no routed live-state
// resource may name an excluded table in a route. Its delivery fires only on a
// change to that table, which an excluded (trigger-less) table
// can never produce — so the policy would be dead config that silently degrades
// the resource to hydrate-on-mount. A surface that reads an excluded table should
// be an endpoint read on open, like the Slow Ops pane's `listSlowOps` (a live
// value over it would never update); one that must stay live makes the table a
// change producer — or, for an aggregate recomputed on the writer's own cadence
// rather than per row, is served external and notified by that writer (the
// latency ledger's summary, on its minute flush). The no-db-backed-notify check
// derives that exemption from this declaration, per table: a DB-reading value
// served external passes only in the plugin that excludes a table, and only when
// its call names that table — so pass `table: <identifier>` literally.

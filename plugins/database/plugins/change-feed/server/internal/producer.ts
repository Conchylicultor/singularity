// An in-process change producer: the change source of a table the feed installs
// NO trigger on (see research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8.md
// P5). A table whose writes are all made by this backend, at a rate where a
// per-statement trigger + changelog row + NOTIFY costs more than what the table
// records (a deduped crash counter UPDATEd thousands of times a minute), declares
// a producer instead: its writes route straight into the live-state cascade from
// the process that made them, coalesced at the source.
//
// THE PRODUCER OWNS THE WRITE VERB. There is no `emit` to call after a write —
// `mutate` runs one insert / update / delete builder on the producer's OWN table
// (a builder on another table is a tsc error), appends `RETURNING <pk>` itself
// and emits exactly the PKs the statement returned: an insert or update (an
// upsert included) is a `U`, a delete a `D`. So "a write followed by no emit"
// and "an emit naming the wrong rows" have no spelling. The executor is the POOL
// (`ProducerExecutor`), which a transaction handle does not satisfy: every
// producer write is one autocommit statement, so its emit is after commit by
// construction — a caller's open transaction cannot host one (and later roll
// it back under an emitted change).
//
// VOLATILE. A producer change has no changelog row and no NOTIFY: a coalesced
// change still pending when the process restarts (or is hot-swapped) is lost.
// Clients resubscribe and load in full, so nothing stays wrong past a
// resubscribe; inside one live subscription a lost emit heals the window's
// membership (its next membership refill re-sorts through `windowIdsOf`) but not
// the values of rows already in the client's base. Hence the guards:
//
//  - A6 (live-state-snapshot): no L2-persisted reader of a produced table, so
//    "lost" never becomes "persisted wrong" (boot throws on static evidence;
//    a persist naming one is refused).
//  - A12: `mutate` on a producer that is not MOUNTED (its `declare` among the
//    collected contributions) throws — its table then has a trigger, so its
//    writes would be fed twice, or routed by a process that never booted it.
//  - A13: `mutate` outside the SERVING backend (`bootMode !== "serve"`) throws.
//    An exec child (a supervised job body, a CLI) has its own runtime and no
//    subscribers, so its emit would be silently lost; it files through the
//    outbox, and the backend's own writer emits.
//  - A11 (`change-feed:producer-writes` check): a write to a produced table
//    that does not go through `mutate` (a drizzle insert/update/delete outside
//    a builder callback, a raw SQL write naming the table) fails the check.
//
// COALESCING. A producer may coalesce at the source: a pending `Map<id, U|D>`
// (last op wins), flushed once per fixed window armed on the first buffered
// change and never re-armed — a true rate cap, which the runtime's debounce is
// not (any flush cycle drains it). The flush routes the deletes, then the
// upserts; `changedAt` is the earliest buffered emit, so the measured latency
// includes the window. An `interactive` write flushes the whole buffer as soon
// as its statement resolves (somebody is waiting to see it). Above
// `PRODUCER_IDS_CAP` distinct ids the flush routes `ids: null` instead — one
// bounded FULL per reading tuple.
//
// ROOT CONTEXT. The window's timer and every flush run in the async context
// captured at module eval (`AsyncLocalStorage.snapshot()`), never the writer's:
// a writer inside `runWithoutProfiling` (every observability write is) would
// otherwise hide the `route` span and the whole flush cycle it schedules from
// the profiler.

/**

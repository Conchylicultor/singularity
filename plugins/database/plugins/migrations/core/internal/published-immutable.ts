/**
 * Published migrations are immutable — the rule, in one spelling.
 *
 * For every published ref R (`publishedMigrationRefs`), every migration file
 * present at `merge-base(HEAD, R)` must exist in the working tree
 * byte-identical. Diffing against the merge-base rather than R itself is what
 * tells "this branch changed a published file" from "this branch is just
 * behind R": a stale branch has every file of its merge-base untouched.
 *
 * Covered: every `.sql` (its sha8 is the runner's ledger key in every deployed
 * DB) and every `meta/*_snapshot.json` (a link of someone's snapshot chain).
 * Not covered:
 * - `meta/_journal.json` — derived from the `.sql` names and regenerated on
 *   every build, so it legitimately changes whenever a migration is added.
 * - `meta/_*_answers.json` — create-vs-rename history for a migration's
 *   authoring; neither the runner nor drizzle reads a published one, so an
 *   edit changes no database and no chain.
 *
 * Also asserted for every published `.sql`: its filename sha8 is the sha256
 * prefix of its content — the invariant the runner's identity rests on —
 * except the closed set of historical files below that landed before it was
 * enforced and can never be renamed.

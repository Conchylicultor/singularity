/**
 * The ONE definition of "published" for migrations.
 *
 * > A migration is published once it exists on any `main` this checkout knows
 * > of: local `main`, or `refs/remotes/<any>/main`.
 *
 * - Author: `main` + `origin/main`.
 * - Clone: local `main` holds the user's own migrations, `origin/main` (or
 *   `upstream/main`) the author's.
 * - Fork: `origin/main` + `upstream/main`.
 * - An upstream-merge branch: upstream's migrations are on `upstream/main`, the
 *   user's on `main` — both immutable, so push's normalize resets neither.
 *
 * The union needs no remote classification, so it is offline and side-effect
 * free — checks call it. It deliberately does NOT go through the remotes
 * plugin's `resolvePublishTarget` (may run a dry-run push) or
 * `resolveUpstreamRemote` (may add a remote). Erring toward "published" is the
 * safe direction: the worst case is a branch migration that already sits on
 * some remote's `main` is not consolidated — and it really is out there.
 *
 * See research/2026-09-30-global-clone-migrations-published-set.md.

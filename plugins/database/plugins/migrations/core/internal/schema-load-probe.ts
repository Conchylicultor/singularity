/**
 * Every schema-glob file that drizzle-kit's synchronous `require()` cannot
 * load, as `{ file, error }` — empty when all of them load.
 *
 * drizzle-kit swallows a schema file that throws at load and exits 0 having
 * generated a migration WITHOUT that file's tables: a silent drop, whatever the
 * error is. Asking its output which errors it printed only catches the kinds
 * someone listed. So the one question — "does each file load?" — is answered by
 * loading each one, the way drizzle-kit does, before trusting a generation.
 *
 * One subprocess (`scripts/require-probe.ts`) replicates drizzle-kit's load:
 * run from this plugin's dir (its module/tsconfig resolution) with exactly
 * drizzle-kit's environment — which is to say, no runtime namespace. A schema
 * file that resolves one at module eval would break real generation, so the
 * probe must not be handed one the real run does not have.
 *
 * Read by `schema-files-loadable` (every check pass) and by
 * `generateMigration` (before every drizzle-kit run). Throws when the probe
 * itself produces no parseable answer: an unanswered question is not "no
 * failures".

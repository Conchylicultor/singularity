/**
 * CODEGEN config for `drizzle-kit generate` — and ONLY that subcommand.
 *
 * `generate` is a pure filesystem operation: it diffs the discovered schema
 * files against the snapshots in `./data` and writes SQL. It opens no
 * connection, so this file needs no database. It used to call
 * `readDatabaseConfig()` and throw without `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, which made a
 * filesystem codegen step LOOK database-entangled — the reason migration
 * generation appeared impossible on a host with no local cluster.
 *
 * drizzle-kit's `Config` type still demands credentials, so we hand it an
 * explicit non-connecting sentinel. `.invalid` is the reserved TLD (RFC 2606):
 * it is guaranteed never to resolve, so if a dialing subcommand is ever pointed
 * at this config the connection fails LOUDLY instead of silently reaching a real
 * database — the host's own, or worse, the wrong worktree's.
 *
 * Consequently the dialing subcommands (`push`, `migrate`, `studio`, `pull`) are
 * UNSUPPORTED through this config and must never be wired up: migrations are
 * applied by the runner in `server/internal/runner.ts` (on boot) or by
 * `./singularity apply-migrations`, both of which build their own connection.
 *
 * That invariant is enforced twice over, and neither half is a text scan.
 * `core/internal/drizzle-cli.ts` OWNS the argv — the binary name and `generate`
 * are one literal there, and callers pass typed flags, so no argument shape can
 * express another subcommand. The one remaining way to reach the tool, spelling
 * its name into your own spawn, is caught by the
 * `drizzle-cli-safety/no-adhoc-drizzle-cli` lint rule.

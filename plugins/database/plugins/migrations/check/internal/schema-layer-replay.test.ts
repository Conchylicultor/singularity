/**
 * Fresh-install guard: the WHOLE real `data/` directory, replayed from an empty
 * database through the boot schema layer with the real derived layer (every
 * view, rollup table and derived-`updatedAt` trigger main declares), applies.
 * A fresh install and a release both start from an empty base DB, so a phase
 * group, a claim or a derived object that only works on top of an existing
 * database would break them and nothing else.
 *
 * The derived inputs are gathered exactly as `migration-applies-clean` gathers
 * them (this process never boots either), which is why the suite sits here.
 *
 * Requires the running embedded cluster (`./singularity build` first).

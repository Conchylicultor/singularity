// The one connect bound for every direct DB connection a check opens.
//
// It is a wall-clock timer, and it counts on the CHECK PROCESS's own event loop
// — the single JS thread a full check pass shares between ~100 concurrently
// started checks. That thread stays saturated for the first 8–16 s of a pass
// (observed 2026-09-10: not even the most trivial check finished before 7.5 s),
// so a 5 s bound expired against a healthy Postgres that had answered in
// milliseconds: the process simply could not read the answer before its own
// timer fired, and the check aborted the whole run.
//
// 60 s equals Postgres's own `authentication_timeout`: past it the server has
// already dropped a connection that sent nothing, so a longer client bound buys
// nothing. It also bounds the checks that previously had no connect timeout at
// all and could hang forever.

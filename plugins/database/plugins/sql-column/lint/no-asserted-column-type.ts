/**
 * no-asserted-column-type
 *
 * `text("status").$type<"a" | "b">()` and `jsonb("data").$type<T>()` declare a
 * type nothing produces. Unlike
 * `.mapWith`, `$type` changes **no runtime behaviour at all** — it is purely a
 * type assertion — so a row holding anything else is handed to typed code as if
 * it matched, and every downstream `switch` falls through. It is the
 * `pool.query<Row>(sql)` hole (`sql-rows`) and the ``sql<T>`…` `` hole
 * (`sql-projection`) one layer lower: on the column itself.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical here. Two of this repo's five sites already carry a
 * `tolerantEnum(...)` hedge at the live-state resource boundary — created, per
 * its own doc comment, because "a single stale row would otherwise throw a
 * `ZodError` on the WS push path and blank the entire list". That guard sits on
 * the WIRE, so it protected the browser and nothing else: two server-side
 * readers went straight to the raw column and would have thrown a `TypeError`
 * on a registry lookup for a legacy value the guard exists to absorb.
 *
 * There are two spellings that let you narrow a text column's type WITHOUT a
 * decoder, and both are banned:
 *
 *   text("x").$type<T>()          the assertion
 *   text("x", { enum: [...] })    the type derived from a runtime list
 *
 * The second is better — the type comes from real data rather than from an
 * unrelated type, so it cannot drift — but drizzle emits no CHECK constraint for
 * it, so the stored value is still unverified. Both of its call sites had also
 * duplicated a literal list their own `shared/schemas.ts` already held, so the
 * migration left one `z.enum` feeding the column and the wire schema alike.
 *
 * The sanctioned door is `parsedText(name, schema)` from
 * `@plugins/database/plugins/sql-column/server`, whose `T` is inferred from the
 * schema argument and from nowhere else. It emits byte-identical DDL (drizzle-kit
 * reads `getSQLType()`, which is `"text"`), so adopting it generates no
 * migration.
 *
 * The jsonb tier is the same hole wearing a disguise, and it is in scope now.
 * `jsonb("x").$type<T>()` at least hands back a real JS value — Postgres
 * genuinely decodes the JSON — so what goes unchecked is only the SHAPE, which
 * reads as mostly fine. It is not, and the remedy differs in one way worth
 * saying at the call site: `parsedJson`'s schema NORMALIZES (a `z.object`
 * strips keys it does not declare, on read and on write), so an open bag wants
 * a `z.record` and a closed shape wants a `z.object`. That choice is the whole
 * of porting a site.
 *
 * Scoped by the chain's ROOT: it fires only when the `$type` / config sits on a
 * literal `text(` / `varchar(` / `char(` / `jsonb(` call. A bare `jsonb("x")`
 * with no `$type` stays legal — it reads back `unknown`, which is what the
 * column holds. `defineEntity`'s generic `b.$type()` is out for good: its type
 * came from a field's own `FieldDef` and its fix belonged in the
 * `fields.storage` capability, where it landed; the call no longer exists.
 *
 * NOT type-aware, matching the closest precedents (`no-asserted-sql-type`,
 * `no-unparsed-sql-rows`, `no-narrow-zodtype`) — and self-contained by necessity:
 * a contributed rule file is loaded by jiti, which cannot resolve the
 * `@plugins/*` alias, so the rule can name no type from the repo.
 *
 * See research/2026-08-25-database-decoded-columns.md and
 * research/2026-08-26-global-decoded-jsonb-entity-columns.md.

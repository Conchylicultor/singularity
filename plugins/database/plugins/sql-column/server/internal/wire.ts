/**
 * A column type's WIRE form: what one of its values becomes when a row crosses
 * the JSON wire to the browser.
 *
 * Most columns need nothing — a `text`, a number, a boolean or a timestamp is
 * already a JSON value (or one `JSON.stringify` makes, like a `Date`). A few
 * are not: a `bytea` comes back from `pg` as a `Buffer`, which JSON spells as
 * `{"type":"Buffer","data":[…]}`. Such a column type declares its wire form ONCE,
 * here, and everything that projects the column onto the wire
 * (`network/live`'s `serveCollection`) applies it — in JS, per row, never in SQL
 * (Postgres' `encode(…, 'base64')` folds lines at 76 characters).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const byteaType = customType<{ data: Uint8Array; driverData: Uint8Array }>({ … });
 * export const bytea = (name: string) =>
 *   withWire(byteaType(name), { schema: z.string(), encode: stateToBase64 });
 * ```
 *
 * The codec's wire type rides on the built column's TYPE (a phantom brand on its
 * `columnType`, which drizzle carries from the builder through `pgTable`), so a
 * consumer can demand that a row schema's field be the wire type — a field
 * typed as the stored bytes is a tsc error there. At runtime the codec is
 * recorded against the built column, which is what {@link columnWireCodec}
 * reads.

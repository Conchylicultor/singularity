/**
 * The zod schema a `parsedText` / `parsedJson` column decodes through, as
 * DATA a reader can ask a built column for.
 *
 * A column's decoder is the schema it was handed — so anything that must tell
 * two decoders apart (query-resource's persisted-compile definition, A18 of
 * research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md) has to read
 * the schema, not the column's name or SQL type: a change to the schema moves
 * what a read of the column produces while leaving both untouched.
 *
 * Recorded the way `withWire` records its codec (`./wire.ts`): the builder's
 * `build(table)` is shadowed on the ONE builder the factory returns, so the
 * schema is attached to the column it builds whatever the builder chain did in
 * between (`.notNull()`, `.default()` return the same builder).

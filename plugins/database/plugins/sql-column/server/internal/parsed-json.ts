/**
 * A `jsonb` column whose shape comes from a decoder that actually runs.
 *
 * `jsonb("x").$type<T>()` is the same pure assertion `text("x").$type<Union>()`
 * was — `$type` is `return this` and changes no runtime behaviour — with one
 * difference that reads like a defence and is not: Postgres genuinely decodes
 * the JSON, so the *value* really is a JS value. What was never checked is its
 * **shape**. A row written by older code, by hand, or by a worktree on different
 * code is handed to typed code as if it matched `T`.
 *
 * {@link parsedJson} is {@link parsedText}'s sibling and works the same way: the
 * column's select type is `z.infer` of the schema it is handed, `T` is inferred
 * from that argument and from nowhere else, and the same schema runs on every
 * read *and* every write. Everything `parsed-text.ts` documents about the
 * `this`-bound label, nullability, and the encoder's reach applies verbatim.
 *
 * ## It normalizes, it does not only check
 *
 * A `z.object` **strips keys it does not declare** — on read and on write alike.
 * So a row carrying an extra key comes back without it, and a write carrying one
 * stores it stripped. That is the point rather than a side effect: it is what
 * makes the declared type *true* instead of merely asserted. Where every key
 * matters, say so in the schema (`.passthrough()`, or a `z.record`, which keeps
 * every key by construction).
 *
 * ## What it costs — the schema is the dial
 *
 * A zod parse costs what the **schema's** depth costs, not what the payload's
 * size costs. `traces.snapshot` is the largest jsonb value in the repo (avg
 * 123 KB, max 536 KB), and its schema is eight scalars plus
 * `events: z.record(z.unknown())` — the engine deliberately never names a key.
 * Decoding one ~96 KB snapshot: `JSON.parse` (which pg already pays) 561 µs, the
 * real schema **1.7 µs**, a deep schema fully describing the same bytes 481 µs.
 *
 * So a schema that declines to describe a payload declines to pay for it, and
 * the opt-in dial is the schema itself. There is deliberately no second knob:
 * one that could disagree with the schema would be a knob for declaring a type
 * you do not check, which is the hole this closes.
 *
 * ## Two differences from `parsedText`, both forced by jsonb
 *
 *  1. `toDriver` returns `JSON.stringify(parsed)` — what drizzle's own
 *     `PgJsonb.mapToDriverValue` does (`pg-core/columns/jsonb.js:21`).
 *  2. **No string-branch on read.** `pg` decodes jsonb itself
 *     (`pg-types.getTypeParser(3802)` is `JSON.parse`), so `fromDriver` receives
 *     an already-decoded JS value and never a string. Drizzle's own
 *     `PgJsonb.mapFromDriverValue` re-parses a string and, on failure, **returns
 *     the raw string** — an absorbed failure, and ambiguous besides, since a
 *     jsonb column may legitimately hold a JSON string. The driver value goes
 *     straight to the schema instead: if it is ever a string where an object was
 *     declared, the schema says so, loudly, naming the column.
 *
 * `getSQLType()` is `"jsonb"`, drizzle-kit reads it into the snapshot with no
 * branch on the column class, and `"jsonb"` is on its native-type whitelist — so
 * this column is byte-identical in DDL and snapshot to `jsonb("x")` and swapping
 * one for the other generates no migration.

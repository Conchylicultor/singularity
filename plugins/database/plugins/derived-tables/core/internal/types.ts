// A rollup is a trigger-maintained materialized aggregate table — a
// "hand-rolled IVM" for an aggregate too expensive to recompute from scratch on
// every live-state load, yet not expressible as a plain derived view. It is
// DERIVED state: fully recomputable from its source tables, created imperatively
// on boot (never a drizzle migration), kept current by STATEMENT-level triggers
// on each source, and diffed against its sources on every boot.
//
// A rollup is DATA (`defineRollup`): the owner declares its table, its key, the
// one query that computes its rows, and the source tables whose writes move it.
// Every piece of SQL — the table, a maintain function and three triggers PER
// SOURCE, and the reconcile — is generated from that declaration, so the
// trigger set, the columns a trigger diffs and the source list the routing
// layer reads (`rollupSources()`) cannot disagree.

 * only its new keys: the hop table must then be a source of its own whose
 * `carry` is the key, that keys on or reads `match`, and that fires on update

# derived-tables

A **trigger-maintained materialized rollup** ("hand-rolled IVM") is the home for
an aggregate that is too expensive to recompute from scratch on every live-state
load, yet **not expressible as a plain derived view** (a "latest row per group",
a per-parent aggregate a hot view joins). It is the L3/IVM rung of the
live-state engine, built without the unavailable `pg_ivm` extension.

Like a plain derived view, a rollup is **derived state, not stateful schema**:
fully recomputable from its source tables, created imperatively on boot (never a
drizzle migration), kept current by STATEMENT-level triggers on its sources, and
diffed against them on every boot.

## A rollup is data: `defineRollup`

```ts
export const attemptConvAgg = defineRollup({
  table: _attemptConvAgg,            // drizzle READ handle (non-glob file)
  key: _attemptConvAgg.attemptId,    // its single-column primary key
  select: (scope) => `SELECT c.attempt_id, true AS has_conv, …
                        FROM conversations c WHERE ${scope("c.attempt_id")}
                       GROUP BY c.attempt_id`,
  sources: [{ table: _conversations, carry: _conversations.attemptId,
              reads: [_conversations.status, _conversations.endedAt] }],
});
// server definition: contributions: [DerivedTable(attemptConvAgg)]
```

- **The minted `Rollup<T>` carries its handle** (`rollup.handle`, the
  `table` passed in): a collection joining the rollup (query-resource's
  `RollupJoin`) reads its table from there, so the table read and the sources
  routed are one rollup's by construction.
- **`select`** returns the rollup's rows, exactly its columns by name;
  `scope(keyExpr)` restricts them to the keys being maintained (`true` in the
  reconcile's drift scan, `keyExpr = ANY(<keys>)` in a maintain function and
  the reconcile's write). Call it once.
- **A source** is a table whose writes move the rollup. `carry` is the source
  column naming the rollup row (the key, or — with `via: { table, match, key }`
  — a value one hop maps to it); `reads` are the other source columns the
  aggregate reads; `ops` narrows the statement kinds (default all three).
- **Everything is generated** (`core/internal/define-rollup.ts`): the
  `CREATE TABLE` from the handle's columns; per source one
  `<rollup>__<source>_maintain()` function and its
  `<rollup>__<source>_{i,u,d}` triggers; the reconcile. So the triggers, the
  columns an UPDATE diffs and the source list routing reads (`rollupSources()`)
  cannot disagree.
- **Asserted at module eval:** the table is an `IMPERATIVE_PUBLIC_TABLES` value
  (`assertImperativePublicTable`, C11 — the generated `CREATE TABLE` line carries
  that call, which is how `imperative-create-table-allowlisted` accepts it); `key`
  is the table's only pk column; every column belongs to the table it is used
  against; a carry (or via hop) has the key's type; one source per table; `select`
  calls `scope` once.
- **Asserted at install** (whenever a rollup's maintain functions are
  (re)installed): the `select`, compiled as a temp view, returns exactly the
  table's columns (the projection reads them by name, so an extra one would be
  dropped silently), and every column it reads is declared — on a source table
  its pk, `carry` or a `reads` entry, on a via table `match` or `key`; any other
  table is refused. Read off the view's `pg_depend` rows, i.e. what Postgres
  parsed. An undeclared read is a write no UPDATE re-aggregates (C1), which
  would leave the rollup stale until the next boot's reconcile. A whole-row
  reference (`row_to_json(c)`) records no column and is not seen.

### What a maintain function does

1. **Collect the carried values the statement moved.** INSERT: `new_rows`;
   DELETE: `old_rows`; UPDATE: `old_rows FULL JOIN new_rows ON <pk>` where the pk
   changed or `ROW(carry, reads…)` IS DISTINCT. The UPDATE trigger has **no
   column list** (C1): Postgres refuses transition tables on one, so the diff
   lives here — a write to a column the rollup does not read (`waiting_for`,
   `last_viewed_at`, …) re-aggregates nothing.
2. **Resolve them to keys** (through `via` if declared), sorted.
3. **A34: take a transaction-scoped advisory lock per key, in sorted order,**
   before aggregating. A concurrent writer of the same key waits until this
   transaction ends, and its own aggregate — a fresh statement — then sees this
   one's rows. Without it two writers each aggregate without the other's rows
   and the later upsert loses one (`migrations/check/internal/rollup-oracle.test.ts` pins it).
   Locks of two rollups taken by one RI cascade cannot be globally ordered, so a
   cross-rollup abort stays possible; it is a loud 40P01, never silent.
4. **Upsert the aggregate guarded** (`DO UPDATE … WHERE ROW(t.vals) IS DISTINCT
   FROM ROW(EXCLUDED.vals)`), so an unchanged row keeps its xmin, and **delete**
   a key the aggregate no longer has.

**A hop is read at trigger time.** An RI cascade that deletes the hop row (an
attempt delete cascading to its conversations) resolves nothing through it; the
hop table must then be a source of its own whose `carry` is the key
(`task_latest_conversation`'s `attempts` source, carrying `task_id` on update and
delete — step 21 of `research/2026-10-06-global-scoped-change-routing-p8-v3.md`;
before it, only the boot reconcile healed that case). A collection that JOINS such a rollup is refused
at module eval until it does: query-resource's A35 (`assertHopsCovered`)
requires each `via` table to be a source of the same rollup carrying the hop's
`key`, reading its `match`, firing on `update` and `delete` — without it the
reader's route would miss the old key exactly as the maintain function does.

## The boot install (`rebuildDerivedTables`)

Runs inside the migrations plugin's **one boot schema-layer transaction**
(`applySchemaLayer`, from the `database` plugin's `onReadyBlocking`), after the
migrations and `installDerivedUpdatedAt` and before `rebuildDerivedViews` (a view
may read a rollup). It takes `db` and `rollups` as arguments — never the database
barrel (a cycle) nor `DerivedTable.getContributions()` (empty in the
`migration-applies-clean` check, a process that never boots).

### Definition: only what changed

- **Table** — compared to its live shape (columns, types, nullability, key)
  every boot; created when missing, **dropped (CASCADE) and recreated** when it
  differs. A rollup is derived, so a shape change is a refill by the reconcile,
  never a migration; `rebuildDerivedViews` restores a view the CASCADE dropped.
- **Maintain functions** — `CREATE OR REPLACE`, no table lock, signature-gated
  per rollup (`functions:<rollup>` in `derived_table_object_state`), after the
  install-time `select` assert above.
- **Triggers — one source table per savepoint, in a fixed order (by name), only
  when that table's triggers changed** (C12 / D25; signature `triggers:<table>`
  plus the catalog: each trigger's name, function and shape — AFTER, FOR EACH
  STATEMENT, its one op, no column list — so a trigger altered by hand is
  reinstalled rather than left for A21 to refuse). A trigger change takes ShareRowExclusive on the source
  (`CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER`; only dropping a stale or legacy trigger takes
  AccessExclusive), held until the schema layer commits — savepoints release
  nothing. During a hot swap the old backend still writes those tables; the
  fixed order (attempts < conversations < pushes, the app's parent-before-child
  write order) means a writer in that order and the layer only ever wait for
  each other one way. A writer in the opposite order can close a cycle; Postgres
  aborts the layer, which fails loudly naming the table (`migrations/check/internal/rollup-boot-order.test.ts`).
  A steady-state boot takes no source lock at all.
- **Stale objects** — a trigger calling a managed maintain function that is not
  declared (a legacy hand-written `<rollup>_{i,u,d}`, a dropped source's) is
  dropped, then any unused managed function (`<rollup>_maintain`,
  `<rollup>__*_maintain`). Never a change-feed `live_state_*` or a
  `*_derive_updated_at` object.
- **A21** — every boot then asserts the catalog holds exactly the generated
  triggers: each on its source, calling its function, `AFTER … FOR EACH
  STATEMENT` on its one op, no column list.
- **State** — `derived_table_object_state`, one signature per object. The
  older builds' one-row `derived_table_state` (`id boolean, signature`) is kept
  in that shape and only **emptied** every boot: an older build booting on this
  database (main reverted past this layer, a branch on a fork of main) then
  finds no signature and reinstalls its legacy triggers beside these — harmless
  duplicates the next boot of this code drops as stale. Reshaping it would fail
  that build's `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id)` and with it its whole schema layer;
  leaving its row would make it skip and run with no trigger at all. Drop the
  table once no supported build reads it.

### Repair: the reconcile, every boot, diff-first (D21)

A rollup holds rows and can drift with its definition byte-identical (a
`TRUNCATE` fires no trigger; a source write the declaration missed; downtime and
bulk loads), so no definition signature can license skipping it. Per rollup, in
one transaction (a savepoint of the schema layer):

1. **`driftSql`** — read-only: the keys whose row differs from the aggregate,
   is missing, or has no aggregate. A clean boot stops here — it writes and
   locks nothing (before, it rewrote every row every boot).
2. **`lockSql(keys)`** — the maintain functions' A34 advisory lock per key, in
   the same sorted order, held until the schema layer commits.
3. **`reconcileSql(keys)`** — the maintain functions' own write over those
   keys, in a fresh statement (a fresh snapshot): re-aggregate, upsert only
   what differs, delete what has no aggregate; returns the counts.

The lock is what makes a heal safe against the old backend writing during a
hot swap: a maintain holding a key's lock commits before step 3 aggregates (so
step 3 sees its rows), and one arriving later waits for the layer and then
aggregates over the healed state. Without it, a maintain that found the drifted
row already equal to its new aggregate would write nothing, and the reconcile
would overwrite the row from a snapshot predating that write
(`rollup-oracle.test.ts` pins it). Its locks across rollups are taken rollup by
rollup (by table name); a writer holding another order can close a cycle, which
Postgres aborts loudly (40P01) — and only on keys that had drifted.

**It returns its counts, it does not publish them (C13):**
`rebuildDerivedTables` → `{ table, upserted, deleted, definitionChanged }[]` →
`applySchemaLayer`'s `{ pending, rollups }` → the database plugin publishes them
with `publishReconciledRollups` **after the layer commits** (the dry run and the
replay suite compute heals that roll back). `reconciledRollups()` reads them and
throws before that commit. live-state-snapshot asserts it in `onReadyBlocking`
(A20) and treats a heal as its backstop: a healed rollup changed rows with
nothing in the changelog, so every persisted L2 row is cleared there — before
readiness flips, so boot-snapshot never serves one — and every persisted key
is recomputed in `onReady`.

## Consumers of the collection

- `feedExemptTables()` — the rollup table names; the change-feed merges them into
  its trigger denylist (a rollup is a read-cache fed by its sources' changes,
  never an independent write surface).
- `rollupSources()` — rollup → the source tables whose triggers maintain it
  (C30), for routing a rollup's readers by its sources' writes.
- `Rollup.sources` — query-resource's rollup join routes each source (`carry`,
  its `carryType`, `via`, `reads`, `pk`), never the rollup table (A1).

## Boundaries

- `core/` — `defineRollup` and the `Rollup` / `RollupSpec` / `RollupReconcile`
  types. Pure: drizzle handles in, SQL text out, no DB.
- `server/` — the `DerivedTable` contribution, `rebuildDerivedTables(db,
  rollups)`, `feedExemptTables()`, `rollupSources()`,
  `publishReconciledRollups` / `reconciledRollups()`.
- `server/testing` — `installRollups(db, rollups)`: the boot install, for a
  throwaway test database.
- The DB-backed oracles (`rollup-oracle.test.ts`, `rollup-boot-order.test.ts`)
  live in `migrations/check/internal/`, beside the schema-layer suites: this
  plugin is upstream of `database` (through migrations), so a suite here
  importing `db-test-fixture` (→ admin → database) would close an import cycle.

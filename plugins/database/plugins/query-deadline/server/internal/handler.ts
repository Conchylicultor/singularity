 * failure inside it surfaces as an unhandled rejection, which the reports
 * plugin itself files. The ring and the push happen FIRST and never wait on it,
 * so the Database health row turns even when the report write is the thing
 * that cannot reach the database.
 *
 * Source `server-caught`: the deadline is an error the server caught in-process
 * and turned into a rejection — no monitor polled for it.

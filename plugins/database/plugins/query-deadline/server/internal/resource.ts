// dot whenever it changes.
//
// The push rides the same live-state flush that a lost query can freeze. That
// is safe by construction: the deadline is what unfreezes the flush (the stuck
// loader gets its error within one deadline), and the hit's notify is queued
// behind it. The "stalled right now" case is the Connection row's job.

/**
 * The shapes a SQL client must have to be usable here — declared
 * **structurally**, never imported.
 *
 * `pg` and `drizzle-orm` are both server-only, and the callers of this plugin
 * span three runtimes (server plugins, `check/` files, `cli/`). Naming those
 * packages — even with a type-only import — would make `core` stop being a
 * leaf.
 *
 * ## That the real types satisfy these was compiled, not asserted
 *
 * Structural typing is the whole bet here, so it was checked against the real
 * packages rather than reasoned about. Under the repo's `strict` +
 * `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, all six front doors typecheck with **no cast** on:
 *
 * - `pg.Pool`, `pg.PoolClient`, `pg.Client` → `SqlQueryable`. `pg`'s `query` is
 *   overloaded; the one that matches resolves to
 *   `(text: string, values?: any[]) => Promise<QueryResult<any>>`, whose
 *   `rows: any[]` is assignable to `rows: unknown[]` — which is why plain
 *   `unknown[]` works and no `readonly` widening was needed. `pg.FieldDef` has
 *   more members than {@link SqlField}, which assignability allows.
 * - drizzle's `NodePgDatabase` → `SqlExecutable<SQL>`. Note `db.execute()`
 *   returns a `PgRaw<T>`, not a `Promise` — it satisfies `Promise<SqlResult>`
 *   structurally, since drizzle's `QueryPromise implements Promise<T>`.
 * - `pg.QueryResult` and drizzle's raw result are both `SqlResult`, and `T`
 *   infers from the caller's schema through every door.
 *
 * The check itself was a throwaway file, deleted rather than kept: keeping it
 * would have meant importing `pg` and `drizzle-orm` into `core/`, which is the
 * exact property this header is about. The standing proof is the call sites.

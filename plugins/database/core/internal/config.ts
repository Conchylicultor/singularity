/**
 * THE reader for `~/.singularity/database.json`. Memoized for the process
 * lifetime; `CONFIG_PATH` is resolved at module load from `SINGULARITY_DIR`, so
 * a process that wants a different location must set `SINGULARITY_DIR` in its
 * own environment before this module is first imported (see the co-located
 * `config.test.ts`, which spawns a child for exactly that reason).
 *
 * ENOENT / malformed JSON are TOLERATED and fall back to `SYSTEM_PG_DEFAULTS`
 * ("no managed services, talk to a plain local Postgres"). That is deliberate:
 * the file is written by `./singularity start`, so its absence means "this host
 * has no embedded cluster", not "this call is broken". Callers that genuinely
 * need a live cluster must fail on the *connection*, where the error names the
 * real problem — not here, where it could only say "file missing".
 *
 * Two hand-rolled copies of this reader used to exist (the CLI's `bin/paths.ts`
 * and the `migrations-in-sync` check) with DIVERGENT semantics: the CLI's threw
 * on ENOENT while the other two fell back, so the same missing file produced a
 * crash or a default depending on which entry point you came through. Keep
 * exactly one reader here.

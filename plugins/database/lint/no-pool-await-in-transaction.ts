/**
 * no-pool-await-in-transaction
 *
 * `db.transaction(cb)` checks out ONE pooled Postgres connection and holds it
 * for the whole life of `cb`. Every `await` inside the callback therefore
 * extends the connection lease by however long that await takes — and under
 * event-loop lag (~1s p50 at host load ~50, measured) a 3-await transaction
 * holds its connection for ~3s instead of ~10ms. That 100–500× lease inflation
 * is what saturated the 16-connection pool during the 2026-07-09 incident.
 *
 * Worse than slow: an `await` on the POOL from inside a transaction is a
 * hold-and-wait shape — the transaction pins one connection while queueing for
 * a second one. With enough concurrent transactions that is a deadlock, not a
 * slowdown.
 *
 * The scope is not only `db.transaction(cb)`. A domain may wrap a transaction
 * behind its own chokepoint — `withPageForest(scopes, cb)`, the page editor's
 * forest-write lock — and the hazard is identical, so the openers are a table
 * (`TX_SCOPE_OPENERS`) rather than one hardcoded shape. A chokepoint whose
 * callback binds a CONTEXT object needs no extra machinery: naming `ctx` as the
 * executor binding makes `ctx.tx.select(…)` and `helper(ctx.tx)` pass under the
 * two conditions below exactly as `tx` does.
 *
 * So: inside a transaction-scope callback, every awaited call expression must run
 * on the transaction executor. It passes if the call is
 *   (1) a member chain rooted at the executor binding — `tx.insert(…)`,
 *       `tx.select().from(…)`, `tx.execute(sql\`…\`)`, `ctx.tx.insert(…)`,
 *       `ctx.forest()`; or
 *   (2) handed the executor binding as an argument — `insertForest(tx, {…})`,
 *       `nextRankIn(_conversationGroups, tx)`, `store.run(batch, () => fn(tx))`,
 *       `emit(payload, { tx: batch.tx })`, `writeForestTarget(ctx, a, b)`.
 *
 * A struct literal declared in the callback that carries the executor
 * (`const batch = { tx, before: new Map() }`) counts as the executor for (2),
 * so `flushStatusBatch(batch)` passes — the transaction is reachable from it.
 *
 * Anything else — `await db.select()…`, `await fetch(url)`,
 * `await listBlockingDepIds(taskId)`, an fs read, a gate acquire — is reported.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — the rule cannot see one hop down. A call that merely *receives*
 * the executor (directly or via a carrier struct) satisfies condition (2) even
 * if the helper ignores it and reads off the pool internally. The real instance:
 * `await cascadeBlockedDependents(conversationId, tx)` passes here, yet the
 * helper called `listBlockingDepIds(taskId)` with no executor and hit the pool.
 * That transitive class is closed by a different mechanism — making the executor
 * a REQUIRED parameter on those query helpers, so the leak is a tsc error rather
 * than a runtime hazard (Task 5b). This rule and the required-param convention
 * are two halves of one guardrail; neither is sufficient alone.
 *
 * See research/2026-07-09-global-interactive-lane-origin-based-db-gating.md
 * (Task 5) and its forensic companion
 * research/2026-07-09-global-interactive-lane-under-load.md.

/**
 * A call whose CALLBACK body runs while one pooled connection is checked out.
 *
 * `db.transaction(cb)` is drizzle's own. It is not the only one: a domain can
 * wrap a transaction behind a chokepoint — `withPageForest(scopes, cb)`, the
 * page editor's forest-write lock — and the callback then binds a CONTEXT object
 * carrying the executor (`ctx.tx`) rather than the executor itself. That is
 * exactly the "struct literal that carries the executor" shape condition (2)
 * already models, so the carrier machinery below needs no change at all: naming
 * `ctx` as the binding makes `ctx.tx.select(…)` root-matched and
 * `helper(ctx.tx)` argument-matched for free. Only the callback's ARGUMENT
 * POSITION differs.
 *
 * **Why a named registry rather than a structural rule.** A convention like
 * "any `with*(…, cb)` call opens a transaction scope" would over-match every
 * scope helper in the repo — `withHeavyReadSlot`, `withBrowser`,
 * `runInBackgroundLane` — none of which hold a connection, turning every
 * legitimate pool call inside them into a build failure. A type-aware match
 * ("is this parameter a `PageForestCtx`") is unavailable: a contributed rule
 * file is loaded by jiti, which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` alias, so the
 * rule cannot name the type. A table of openers is the honest middle — one
 * place, one line per chokepoint, and it generalizes the `.transaction`
 * hardcode this rule already carried rather than adding a second special case.

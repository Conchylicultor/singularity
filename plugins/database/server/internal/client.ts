// background gate, N transactions each holding a slot while awaiting a slot for
// their inner query deadlock the background lane permanently — the classic
// hold-and-wait cycle. Under two, the wait-for graph is acyclic by construction:
//
//     bg-tx → bg-query → pool connection → {interactive, boot}
//
// and the terminal holders always complete. Concretely: bg-tx holders pin at most
// BACKGROUND_TX_MAX connections and bg-query holders at most BACKGROUND_QUERY_MAX,
// so as long as
//
//     BACKGROUND_TX_MAX + BACKGROUND_QUERY_MAX ≤ POOL_MAX − RESERVED_INTERACTIVE
//
// at least RESERVED_INTERACTIVE connections always remain free — the bg-query
// holders can therefore always finish and release the slots the transactions are
// waiting on, and no cycle can close. That inequality IS the proof, so it is
// asserted below at module load rather than left in prose.

// happened to be open), never a genuine read dependency. Exported for co-located
// unit testing.
//
// HOW THE NAME IS SPELLED DOES NOT MATTER. Drizzle double-quotes every
// identifier it emits; a hand-written `sql` template usually does not, because
// that is how people write SQL. Both are matched, and they differ only in what
// happens after the match:
//
//   - a QUOTED name is taken as written, exactly as it always has been;
//   - an UNQUOTED name is only a candidate. Anything at all can follow FROM — a
//     CTE name, a subquery alias, a set-returning function — so a candidate is
//     kept only if it names a relation that really exists in the `public` schema
//     (`setKnownRelations` below). A phantom name in a read-set is not free
//     noise: the Debug → Read-set pane calls a resource a "silent FULL" the
//     moment its read-set holds a table the change-feed does not cover, so
//     unfiltered aliases would drown the one surface that exists to spot this
//     class of bug. While no relation set is installed — before boot loads it,
//     and on the central runtime, which never touches this pool — every unquoted
//     candidate is dropped, so capture is then byte-identical to the
//     quoted-only behaviour this replaces.
//
// Three guards on the unquoted branch, each with a live site in this repo:
//   - `IS DISTINCT FROM` is an operator, not a FROM clause, and what follows it
//     is an expression (`page-doc-order.ts` has one inside a live loader). It is
//     matched and then dropped, the same way `DELETE FROM`'s write target is —
//     matching it is what stops the bare `from` branch from picking its operand
//     up.
//   - a candidate immediately followed by `(` is a function call, not a relation
//     — `FROM unnest(…)` and `CROSS JOIN LATERAL (…)`, both in the chord
//     progress loader.
//   - a leading `ONLY` belongs to the clause, not to the name, so `FROM ONLY
//     tasks` captures `tasks`.
//
// A schema-qualified name keeps only its relation part when the schema is
// `public` (which is what the change-feed reports as `TG_TABLE_NAME`), and is
// dropped whole otherwise: the jobs list loader reads
// `FROM graphile_worker._private_jobs`, a schema the change-feed structurally
// excludes, so recording it would add a dependency that can never fire.
//
// One over-capture stays possible: a CTE named after a real table
// (`WITH tasks AS (…) SELECT … FROM tasks`) records a phantom dependency. That
// costs one extra recompute and never a missed one — the direction this index
// has always been allowed to err in.

/**
 * Proves the merged run surface is the LIVE `runs` union window (step 12 of
 * research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md), with no
 * reload:
 *
 *  1. a running backup seeded into `backup_runs` appears on the Backup pane,
 *     and its "Took" cell TICKS (the browser's elapsed time — the server's
 *     duration is NULL while it runs);
 *  2. the run finishes (status, finished_at, archive size): its row and the
 *     backup deep link (`/debug/backup/br/<id>`) update in place;
 *  3. a deploy run on a seeded server shows `<composition> on <server name>`
 *     on the Builds pane's Shipping tab; RENAMING the server relabels the row
 *     live — the label is a lookup over `deploy_servers`, routed by the
 *     server's change, not a correlated subquery nothing could route.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the NO-RELOAD one: a marker stamped on
 * `window` before the first live change must survive to the end.
 *
 * Seeded rows are deleted at the end (also on failure). Refuses main (it
 * seeds rows into the deploy's database).
 *

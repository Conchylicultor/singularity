    "The run-kind registry and the merged run space as ONE routed union window: defineRunKind binds a domain's own ledger into the `runs` collection as an arm (base fields typed against the row, its own columns against its liveArmColumns set; id and duration derived), and serveUnionCollection serves the window, its `:rows` point read (useRun) and `:groups` from every registered arm — a write to one ledger refills only the rows it changed. Names no run kind.",

/**
 * A kind's id chip, web half: the kind's `IdKinds.Presenter` AND its inline
 * chip, minted together so neither can exist without the other.
 *
 * ```ts
 * contributions: [
 *   ...idChip({ presenter: { kind: taskIdKind, useReferent, useOpen }, surfaces: ["transcript", "document"] }),
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Why a factory the family calls, rather than id-chip reading the presenter
 * slot and declaring the chips itself: a web slot is readable only through a
 * React hook, while `inlineChip()` must run at MODULE EVAL — the Lexical hosts
 * and the runs↔doc projection read the chip registry outside any render, and
 * every chip must also stand in the `InlineChip.Tag` declaration surface the
 * docs and the active-data checks read. A chip generated from a slot read
 * would be registered too late for the former and invisible to the latter.
 * So the family's barrel calls this once, and both halves derive from the
 * kind: the pattern is `idChipPattern(kind)` (never re-typed), the chip id is
 * the kind's prefix, and the model reads a resolved id (`modelText:
 * "resolved"`), whose server half is `idChipServer`.
 *
 * `component` overrides the generic chip (title + icon, opening via
 * `useOpen`) for a family with richer chrome (a status dot, a count).

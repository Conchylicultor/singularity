/**
 * A kind's id chip, server half — the twin of the web `idChip`, called from the
 * same family with the same `surfaces`:
 *
 * - `IdKinds.Referent` — the kind's `resolve(id)`, for any server reader;
 * - `InlineTokenReferentSource` over the chip's own pattern, so a model reading
 *   text that holds the id gets `<task id="…" title="…"/>` instead of an
 *   opaque id (the promise the chip's `modelText: "resolved"` makes);
 * - `Editor.InlineToken`, only when the chip belongs in `"document"`: a page
 *   block's doc can then hold the chip node, and the server must be able to
 *   read it back. Markdown-TRANSPARENT: a bare id has no character the inline
 *   markdown scan could misread, so masking it would only cost its marks.
 *
 * `referentTag` names the tag a model reads the resolved id as. It defaults to
 * the kind's label (`idReferentTag`); a family whose long-standing tag differs
 * (a `block-…` resolves to its PAGE, read as `<page …/>`) passes it, so the
 * model-facing text stays byte-identical across the move onto the kind.

/**
 * Pure renderer, reachable ONLY on a claim — `value` is a commit the object
 * database resolved, so there is no "unknown sha" branch here and no hand-rolled
 * `<code>` fallback. When the token does not resolve, `useCommitClaim` declines
 * and the host's arbitration chain owns what renders instead.
 *
 * The chip IS the tooltip trigger: `WithTooltip` clones its child with the
 * trigger's own props and ref, and `LinkChip`'s passthrough lands both on the
 * chip's own `<button>`. This used to need a spare `Inline` wrapper to clone
 * instead, back when `LinkChip` had a closed prop surface that dropped them.

/**
 * A chip that says it belongs in a document must have a server half.
 *
 * ## What breaks without it
 *
 * `inlineChip({ surfaces: [… "document"] })` is a promise about PAGES: the chip
 * appears in a page block, which means a page block's content doc can now hold
 * that chip's decorator node. On the server, `readStateRuns`
 * (`block-text-write/server/internal/block-doc-text.ts`) REFUSES any block whose
 * doc holds a decorator type it has no registered node for — so the block stops
 * being agent-readable and agent-editable. The chip renders perfectly; the
 * failure surfaces later and somewhere else, as an agent's `edit_page` /
 * `write_agent_note` throwing on a block that looks fine in the browser.
 *
 * The server half is ~8 lines (`Editor.InlineToken({ pattern, markdownSpan, node })`) and
 * nothing in the type system asks for it, because the two halves are two
 * plugins' two barrels. So it is asked for here instead — at check time, on the
 * build that ships the chip, rather than at an agent's first edit.
 *
 * ## Generic by construction
 *
 * Nothing below names a chip. The web side is every contribution to the
 * `InlineChip.Tag` slot (which only `inlineChip` can mint) that declared
 * `"document"`; the server side is every `Editor.InlineToken` contribution's
 * pattern. A fifth chip is covered the day it declares the surface, and a chip
 * that drops `"document"` drops out of the set — no list to update.
 *
 * The join key is the PATTERN SOURCE, which is exact rather than approximate:
 * both halves import the same `RegExp` constant from the family's own `core/`
 * (that is the whole point of `pattern.ts` living there), so the sources are
 * identical whenever the two halves really are two halves of one family. A
 * server contribution that protects DIFFERENT bytes than the chip matches is
 * not the missing half, and is correctly reported as missing.

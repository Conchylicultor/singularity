    "Google Maps JavaScript API as the map renderer: draws GeoMap overlays (pins as overlays holding each pin's contributed content, Google's own places hidden, paths as polylines, areas as polygons, strokes in resolved theme tones), frames them only when the set of positions changes, shows the live-map set-up action until a browser key is set, and replaces Google's silent grey map with an error card when the key is refused. Lazily loaded off the boot wave.",

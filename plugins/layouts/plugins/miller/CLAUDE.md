# miller

Miller-columns renderer for the pane chain. Replaces `<PaneRouter/>` at the
shell's main mount: instead of mounting only the root pane and relying on
nested `<Outlet/>` calls, Miller maps `match.panes` to a flat row of
columns. Walking deeper in the URL appends a column on the right; closing
a pane removes the rightmost column.

## Mental model: the chain as a column stack

The chain is an ordered list of panes (root → leaf, left → right). It is
**the URL** — every pane is a URL segment, so the chain and the browser
URL are always in sync. Miller renders each entry as one column.

### Two ways to change the chain

**Reset** — rebuild the chain from scratch. The new chain starts at the
target pane's required ancestry (derived from its `after` declarations)
and ignores whatever was on screen. Happens when there is no valid
position for the target in the current chain.

**Extend** — keep a prefix of the current chain and splice the target in.
Always truncates everything to the right of the insertion point first.
Three sub-cases, all handled by `useOpenPane` (caller-aware):

| Case | Trigger | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Open right** (default) | No special relationship | Truncate after caller, append target |
| **Wrap left** | Caller declares `after: [target]` | Insert target before caller, validate right |
| **Self-update** | Target is the caller | Update params in-place, truncate children |

**Opening on the right always overwrites all columns to the right of the
caller.** There is no way to open a column "beside" a sibling without
affecting the columns further right.

### Example walkthrough

```
Start:               conv1

Open task pane       conv1 │ task          (open right from conv1)
  from conv1 toolbar

Click conv link      conv1 │ task │ conv2  (open right from task)
  in task

Click file link in   conv1 │ task │ conv2 │ file   (open right from conv2)
  conv2

Click file link in   conv1 │ file          (open right from conv1 — everything
  conv1                                     right of conv1 is overwritten)

Open attempt view    attempt │ conv1 │ file (wrap left — conv1 has after:[attempt],
  from conv1                                 so attempt is inserted before conv1;
                                             right side validated and kept)
```

The last step illustrates **wrap left**: because `conversationPane` declares
`after: [attemptPane]`, `useOpenPane` detects that the caller (conv1) can
follow the target (attempt), inserts attempt before conv1, then calls
`validateChain` to keep the right side intact (`conv1 │ file` survives
because it was already valid).

### Implications for pane authors

- **Buttons in a conversation toolbar open panes to the right.** They use
  `useOpenPane` with no special options, so they always truncate the columns
  to their right.
- **To keep a pane's right context alive when inserting a parent**, declare
  `after: [parentPane]` on the child. That lets `useOpenPane` detect the
  wrap-left case and preserve the right side.
- **To force a full reset** (e.g. switching to an unrelated top-level view),
  call `openPane(target, params, { root: true })` or let the routing fall
  through to `buildFreshChain`.

## Public API

- `<MillerColumns/>` — the renderer. The shell mounts it once.

That's it. Pane authors don't import anything from this plugin. They
register panes with the regular `Pane.define` + `Pane.Register` flow, and
optionally set a default column width.

## Per-pane width

```ts
Pane.define({
  id: "tasks-root",
  path: "/tasks",
  component: TasksRoot,
  width: 320,
});
```

`width` is the column's default width in pixels (top-level on
`Pane.define`, separate from chrome so `chrome: false` panes can still
set it). Defaults to 400. The leaf column ignores its own width and
flex-grows to fill remaining space. Users can drag the divider between
columns to resize at runtime. Width state is **per-surface** (keyed by the
column's `PaneStore` via a `WeakMap`), so two mounted surfaces (desktop
multi-window / keep-alive tabs) resize independently; persistence is keyed by
`(tabId, paneId)` in `localStorage`, so a tab keeps its widths across reload
without bleeding across surfaces.

## Collapse

Each non-leaf column has a chevron button on its right edge (the resize
handle) that collapses it to a 32px-wide vertical bar with the pane
title rotated 90°. Click the bar to expand. Collapse state is **per-surface**
(keyed by the column's `PaneStore` via a `WeakMap`), so collapsing a column in
one mounted surface never collapses it in another; it is persisted to
sessionStorage keyed by `(tabId, paneId)` (`miller.collapse.${tabId}.${paneId}`),
so it survives navigation within a tab session and resets on full reload.

When a column is collapsed, its component subtree is unmounted. Panes
that need to stay alive across collapse (e.g. terminal sessions) are
not yet supported — see the open question in
`research/2026-04-30-plugins-miller-columns.md`.

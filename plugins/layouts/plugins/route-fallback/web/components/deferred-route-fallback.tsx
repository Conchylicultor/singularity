/**
 * The layout's fallback surface for a pane route that currently resolves to no
 * pane — the single home for the tri-state "pending / not-found / app-load-error"
 * distinction.
 *
 * WHY this exists: with deferred plugin loading, a cold deep-link into an app
 * (e.g. `/pages/page/<id>`) paints the app shell + surface immediately, but the
 * route's actual *pane* belongs to a plugin that loads a beat later (post-paint,
 * deferred tier). During that gap — and also when a URL is genuinely invalid or
 * its plugin chunk failed to load — the pane router matches nothing, so the
 * layout has no pane to paint. This surface reads the store's tri-state route
 * (`useRouteState`) plus the deferred-load signal to decide what to show:
 *
 * | route state              | loading            | health          | surface        |
 * | ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
 * | resolved [] (bare root)  | —                  | —               | null (blank)   |
 * | unresolved / resolved≠[] | !deferredComplete  | —               | spinner        |
 * | unresolved / resolved≠[] | settled            | load error      | app-load error |
 * | unresolved / resolved≠[] | settled            | healthy         | not-found      |
 *
 * A `resolved` NON-empty route only reaches here when its slots don't resolve to
 * registered panes (stale paneIds from an old bundle, or a still-loading plugin),
 * so once settled it gets the SAME not-found / error treatment as an unresolved
 * URL — never a permanently blank pane. Health = a load error under THIS app's
 * plugin subtree (`PaneLoadScopeContext`); an empty scope is always healthy.
 *
 * The `Loading` primitive has a built-in ~120ms delay-before-show, so a fast
 * deferred load unmounts this before it ever paints — no flash on the warm path.

/**
 * A sub-page rendered inline in its parent's content flow: icon + title, click
 * to open. Its own content lives under a different `page_id`, so this row is a
 * LEAF of the forest the editor reduces over.
 *
 * It is a *void* block — it owns no editable content. Like every other void
 * block it goes through `useVoidCaret`, which registers a focus handle so the
 * editor's focus system can land on it (`navigate()` skips blocks with no
 * handle, and selection / drag read from the same order). That handle carries
 * ONLY `focus`: no `truncateAt`, no
 * `appendRunsAtEnd`, no `focusOffset`. Those are the text-surgery seams a bound
 * text editor exposes, and their absence is what makes it structurally
 * impossible for Enter (split) or Backspace (merge) to ORIGINATE in a page row
 * — the hazard the reducer's guards then backstop.

  // reason: the caret has to live on a control `Row` synthesizes and re-creates

  // Enter/Space fall through to the row's native button activation (open the
  // page), and Backspace is deliberately NOT handled, because deleting a

  // ride an inline `RowActions` beside it, revealed off the row's hover group

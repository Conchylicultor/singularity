// Undo verification for the code block's plain-text surface, in a real browser.
//
// The bug this pins (research/2026-09-01-global-block-text-undo-participation.md):
// pasting inside a `/code` block could not be undone. The textarea declared no
// undo owner, so `resolveUndoOwner` walked up to the page body's
// `surfaceUndoProps` and ⌘Z resolved to the SURFACE stack — the binding called
// `preventDefault()`, killing the browser's own textarea history, while the only
// thing that recorded was a 500ms-debounced autosave. So a ⌘Z pressed in that
// window reversed an unrelated document edit and left the pasted text sitting
// there.
//
// Phase 3 is the reported bug itself: the ⌘Z is sent with NO delay after the
// paste, i.e. inside the old debounce window. Waiting there would let a broken
// build pass.
//
// Phases:
//   1. ``` converts a text block into a code block with a live textarea;
//   2. a typing run is one undo step;
//   3. a paste is its own undo step, undoable IMMEDIATELY (the reported bug);
//   4. redo replays the paste, then a second ⌘Z walks back to the typing;
//   5. undo past the block's own text reaches the structural stack, so the
//      document history stays one chronological stack rather than two.
//

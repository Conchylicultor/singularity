/**
 * The conversations this prompt block has launched, as a row of chips.
 *
 * Two reads, joined client-side: the link rows say WHICH tasks this block
 * launched, and `useTaskConversations` turns that set of tasks into their runs
 * off the already-boot-critical global `attempts` resource. Nothing is stored on
 * the block, so the row is correct after a reload and updates live as an agent's
 * status changes.
 *
 * Both halves are shared: the join is tasks-core's, the chip is
 * `ConversationChip`. This component owns only which tasks to ask about.
 *
 * Transient chrome (a handful of status chips beside a launch button), not a
 * homogeneous domain-record collection — hence `Cluster` + chips rather than a
 * DataView.

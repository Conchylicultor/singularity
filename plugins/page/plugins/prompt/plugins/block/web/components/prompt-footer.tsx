 * The prompt block's action row, contributed as `chrome.regions.footer` — the
 * block-after region, a full-box-width row below the editable line: the launch
 * control plus the conversations this block has already launched.
 *
 * ## Nothing renders on a read-only surface, for two independent reasons
 *
 * `editor` is absent exactly on the read-only surfaces (version-history preview,
 * the public site), and this region returns `null` there rather than degrading
 * to a static rendering, because:
 *
 * 1. Its content is **live agent state, not document content.** A
 *    version-history preview of last Tuesday showing today's conversation chips
 *    would be a lie about the snapshot.
 * 2. It would **crash, not degrade.** `LaunchedConversations` calls
 *    `useOpenPane` / `conversationPane.useRouteEntries()`, neither of which
 *    exists on the public-site surface.
 *
 * The marker (`chrome.regions.start`) does render there — so a prompt still
 * looks like a prompt in a snapshot, it just cannot be launched from one.

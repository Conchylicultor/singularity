//   50 (max 200). Only launches older than a block's 50th would drop out, and a
//   block's launches are a handful.
// - task side, "which page/block did THIS task come from?" — the `:rows` point
//   read by task id (`useLiveRow(promptBlockTasks, taskId)`), where
//   `found: false` is "not launched from a prompt block".
//
// **The row id is `taskId`, the table's primary key** (stored as `parent_id`),
// not `blockId`: the point membership intersects the ids a write touched — PK
// values — with each reader's id set, so keying on `blockId` would name ids no
// write ever reports. `blockId` is a plain filterable column instead.
//
// NOT preloaded: the block renderer and the task-detail origin section both
// mount route-scoped, so they hydrate post-mount via their sub-ack.

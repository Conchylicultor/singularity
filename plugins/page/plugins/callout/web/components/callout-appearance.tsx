 * actions, and a container with no per-instance appearance (the context card)
 * simply contributes no sections at all.
 *
 * `close` is the shell's dismiss: the popover's open state belongs to
 * `ContainerAnchor`, so a control that commits and should dismiss says so rather
 * than owning a second copy of that state. The swatches deliberately do NOT
 * close — picking colours in a row is a comparison, not a commit.

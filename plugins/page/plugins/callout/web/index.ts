    // NOT vestigial: it is where the handle lives, and the handle is what the
    // insert palette, the markdown pipeline, paste, the turn-into list and
    // `useAnchorTypes()` (the reducer's `anchorTypes`) all read. The row's paint
    // comes from the frame's `anchor` below.

    // registration so a type cannot claim anchorhood without actually painting a
    // box (`./singularity check page-editor:anchor-has-decoration`), and `menu`
    // rides on it for the same reason: the container's two surfaces (its glyph
    // and the rail popover on its borrowed line) cannot drift from who paints
    // the box. Both render the SAME appearance controls, deliberately — the
    // structural half of that popover (Collapse / Remove callout / Delete) is
    // generic and contributed by nobody.

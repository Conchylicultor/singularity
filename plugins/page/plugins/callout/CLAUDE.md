# callout

A callout is a **void container**. Its payload is `{icon, iconSvgNodes, color}`
and nothing else — no `text`. Its content IS its children, which are ordinary
blocks of any type that do not know they are inside it:

```
Callout            ← the anchor: appearance only, no line of its own
├── Text  "first line"
├── Heading
└── Bulleted list
```

That is the whole design, and every reported bug was a symptom of the previous
model, in which one row played container identity, appearance AND the first line
of content at once. Enter made a second callout (making another content line
meant making another container); converting the line to a heading destroyed the
box (the line's type *was* the container's identity). Neither is expressible now.

## The container shape is not declared here

`core/callout-block.ts` calls **`defineContainerBlock`**
([`page/container`](../container/CLAUDE.md)), not `defineBlock`. That factory
forces the two facts that are only correct together — `anchor: true`,
`wrapOnConvert: true` — and constrains its schema to a
shape without `text`, so a text-bearing callout is a compile error rather than a
runtime surprise. `acceptsText` is still *derived* from the schema
(`"text" in schema.shape`), so voidness is a fact of the payload and the write
boundary's strict parse rejects a stray `text` outright.

Read that plugin's doc for what each flag buys and why they cannot be declared
piecemeal. This file therefore declares nothing but the callout's identity and
its `{icon, iconSvgNodes, color}` appearance payload — and the two shells it
composes:

- **The frame** (`web/components/callout-frame.tsx`) paints the tint, over the
  anchor's row plus its whole visible subtree. A block renderer cannot do this
  itself: both surfaces render the forest as a flat list of sibling rows so a
  structural move only reorders keyed elements, which means a block's children are
  not its DOM children. `Editor.BlockFrame` is the seam for the other half — see
  `page/editor`'s `internal/block-frames.ts`. Contributing one is also what *makes*
  the callout a container: the framed-type set is derived from that slot's
  registered matches (`useFramedBlockTypes()`), so there is no second "I am a
  container" flag to drift from who actually paints a box.

  The frame declares the **tint and nothing else** — `ContainerBackdrop` owns the
  box's geometry (`absolute` insets from `inset`, never `h-full`, no horizontal
  offset of its own), which is why the tint bleeds to the content edge `C` rather
  than `C + BLOCK_INSET`, and why a stray padding or left border can no longer
  strand the enclosed rows' hover controls.

- **The anchor** (`web/components/callout-anchor.tsx`) is the icon, and it rides
  on the *same* `Editor.BlockFrame` registration (`BlockFrameMeta.anchor`) so a
  type cannot claim anchorhood without actually registering as a container.
  `./singularity check page-editor:anchor-has-decoration` pins the two halves
  together — a handle declaring `anchor: true` whose plugin supplies no component
  is an invisible container, not a cosmetic gap.

  It supplies a `glyph` and `sections` to `ContainerAnchor`; the shell owns the
  static-vs-interactive branch, the trigger and the popover, and the surface owns
  the geometry (a `BLOCK_INDENT`-wide column at `C`, seated on the first visible
  child's borrowed first-line centre, plus the drag listeners).

## The icon popover is APPEARANCE; the rail carries the block actions

It used to carry the whole block-actions menu, for one stated reason: an anchor
row renders no hover rail, so there was nowhere to hang a `BlockActionsMenu`.
**There is now** — the rail on the line the callout BORROWS resolves the callout
as its owner, so its `⠿` handle opens Collapse / Remove callout / Delete
generically (`page/container`'s *The glyph is appearance; the rail is structure*).
The callout contributes none of that: "Remove callout" derives from the handle's
own `label`.

What is left here is what only exists by virtue of the `{icon, iconSvgNodes,
color}` payload — colour, icon, Reset, in
`web/components/callout-appearance.tsx`. It renders in **both** places, by
design: as the `sections` handed `ContainerAnchor` and as the
`BlockFrameMeta.menu` on the same `Editor.BlockFrame` registration. Both go
through `CalloutAppearanceFor`, the one binding of `data → controls →
api.update`, so the duplication is in the SURFACES, never in the wiring.

The popover's open state belongs to whoever hosts it, so the sections dismiss
through the `close()` they are given rather than holding a second copy; the
swatches deliberately do not close (picking colours in a row is a comparison, not
a commit). The trigger `preventDefault`s its mousedown (the click lands beside a
live caret), and commits fire on `onMouseDown` — the same shape
`BlockActionsMenu` uses, for the same reason. `width="xl"` is the callout's own:
its sections host the full icon picker.

## What is deliberately NOT here

There is no callout-specific keystroke handling, and that is the point. Enter in
a child is an ordinary sibling split; Tab / Shift+Tab nest and un-nest with no
callout logic; arrow navigation skips the anchor because it registers no focus
handle; converting a child's type can never reach the container. The single
callout-shaped rung in the generic ladder is `unwrap` — Backspace at the start of
an anchor's first child — and it exists because the generic `isIndented` → outdent
rung would pop that child out *and adopt the remaining siblings as its children*,
silently re-nesting content nobody asked to nest.

The `Editor.Block` contribution is kept with the primitive's shared **null
renderer** (`ContainerNoRow`). `BlockRow`'s anchored branch never dispatches that
slot for an `anchor` type, so it is unreachable — but the registration is where
the HANDLE lives, and the handle is what the insert palette, markdown, paste, the
turn-into list and the reducer's `anchorTypes` all read.

The two e2e scripts are this plugin's real spec, and they are the regression
proof for any change to the container primitive:
`e2e/callout-container-verify.ts` (zero-height row with visible children, a
visible one-line box when childless, the icon's clickable box inside the
`[C, C+BLOCK_INDENT]` column, its centre within ~2px of the first child's
first-line centre, Enter yielding a sibling inside the tint, `/h1` on a child
leaving the container untouched, Tab in/out preserving the caret, Backspace at
the first child's start unwrapping) and `e2e/callout-wrap-verify.ts` (`/callout`
keeps the origin's id and caret; the wrap is ONE undo entry).

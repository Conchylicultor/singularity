 * How a reference to another page — a sub-page row, a link block, an inline

 *
 * A reference knows WHICH page it names. It can never know where that page
 * should appear, because that answer belongs to the surface the editor is
 * mounted in: the Pages app has Miller columns to open one beside another, the
 * website's editor toy is a single box with nowhere else to put anything, and a
 * read-only render has no navigation at all. So the host declares the answer
 * once and every reference below it reads it from here.
 *
 * Context rather than a prop on `<BlockEditor>`, which is what this replaced.
 * The editor's store is COMPOSITE — one feed per expanded nested page, unioned
 * into a single store — so a threaded callback had to be restated at roughly
 * twenty points between the host and the row that finally called it, and every
 * new intent would have restated all of them again. Context crosses the
 * composite store for free, so a second intent (`openAside`) costs one field
 * here and nothing anywhere else.

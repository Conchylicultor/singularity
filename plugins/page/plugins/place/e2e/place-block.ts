// Drives the `/place` block as far as a worktree can reach: the slash menu
// offers it, converting a block mints a place block, and the empty state says
// something true about whether a lookup is possible.
//
// It deliberately stops before searching. A search needs a Google Maps API key,
// and the key lives on the CENTRAL runtime, which always runs main's code
// (`cli/plugins/build/cli/run.ts`: "agent worktrees never change central's running
// code"). So on a branch the provider is not registered centrally, and the
// honest end of this script is the "not set up" affordance — not a result list.
//
// A transcript tool, not a gate: it logs what it saw and fails only when the
// block cannot be created at all — and when the conversion posts a row write the
// server rejects, which is the one thing the transcript reported for months
// (`Invalid data for block type "place": … 'text'`) without anyone reading it as
// a failure. See `research/2026-08-19-page-row-text-invariant-at-the-write-funnel.md`;
// `page/editor/e2e/convert-in-place-verify.ts` is the real gate for that rule.
//
// Usage:

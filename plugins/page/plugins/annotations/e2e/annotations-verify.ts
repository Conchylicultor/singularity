// Executable spec for the ANNOTATION FAMILY as a family — the four blocks that
// carry a page's human↔agent side-channel (`context`, `todo`, `agent-note`,
// `private-note`).
//
// Per-container behaviour (wrap, unwrap, Enter-in-a-child, nesting, the void
// write boundary) is already pinned by
// `plugins/context/e2e/context-container-verify.ts`, and every member is built by
// the SAME `defineAnnotationBlock` call, so this file deliberately does NOT re-run
// that suite four times. It checks only what is true of the family and of nothing
// else:
//
//  1. All four types are REGISTERED and VOID at the write boundary: `{}` is
//     accepted, a `text` key is a 400 (`handle.schema.strict()`).
//  2. Each paints ONE soft-tinted box — a fill and NO border at all — spanning its
//     own zero-height anchor row plus its whole subtree, and never the block that
//     follows it. The box is the card's own CONTENT box, so its left edge lands on
//     the same x as the first letter of the ordinary paragraph after the card,
//     rather than one `BLOCK_INSET` to the left of the prose as it used to.
//  3. The four boxes are visually DISTINCT — four different BACKGROUND colours.
//     With the dashed border and the gutter icon gone, the tint is the only mark
//     a card carries at rest, so hue is now the family's whole resting language.
//     A regression that collapsed two tints into one would leave every other
//     assertion here green.
//  4. Each card SAYS WHAT IT IS only when pointed at: its name sits in the box's
//     top-right corner, fully transparent at rest and revealed on hover. That
//     name is the seat the permanent margin glyph was replaced by, so "the card
//     is decorated" is now a claim about hover, not about paint.
//  5. All four are reachable from the `/` palette by the labels a user types.
//  6. `TODO ` typed at the start of a line WRAPS that line into a todo card, with
//     the prefix stripped and the line surviving as the card's first child — the
//     one member with a typed trigger, and the one thing here that is not shared.
//
// Convention: a box's owner is the FIRST row whose top sits on the box's top edge
// (a void anchor row is zero-height and precedes its first child in document
// order, so the anchor wins) — the same rule the context spec uses, for the same
// reason: frames are grid SIBLINGS of the rows they cover, so DOM ancestry says
// nothing about ownership.
//

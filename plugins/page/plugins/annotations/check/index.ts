 *
 * It is matched against the enriched tree's absolute dirs. If those two ever
 * disagree (a symlinked checkout resolving differently for git and for the

/**
 * Every block type defined under `page/annotations` declares BOTH of the page's

 * (`author`).
 *
 * `defineAnnotationBlock` (`core/define-annotation-block.ts`) makes both
 * REQUIRED, so an annotation written through it cannot be unmarked. What the
 * type system cannot see is a new annotation reaching for `defineContainerBlock`
 * — or `defineBlock` — directly: both are perfectly valid calls that produce a
 * perfectly working card, and the only thing missing is the pair of fields the
 * agent-facing read and write paths are built on. That card would then be an
 * ORDINARY container, falling through to the two absent-value defaults — and
 * those defaults are right for a PARAGRAPH, which is exactly what an annotation
 * is not.
 *
 * The two omissions fail in opposite directions, and both are worth naming
 * because the second one reads as harmless until it happens:
 *
 * - **no `audience`** — "absent means ordinary page content, visible to
 *   everyone", so an agent-facing read path SENDS the card. A `/private`-shaped
 *   block that leaks is precisely the failure this family exists to prevent, and
 *   it leaks silently, in the direction that cannot be undone.
 * - **no `author`** — "absent means the human's", so an agent-facing write path
 *   REFUSES the card, including one the agent itself is supposed to own. That is
 *   the fail-safe direction, and it is still a defect: a `/agent`-shaped card
 *   that forgot to say so becomes unwritable by the only party that ever writes
 *   it, and the symptom is a refusal nobody can explain from the card's own
 *   definition.
 *
 * The discriminator is presence of either field on the handle, because nothing
 * but `defineAnnotationBlock` sets them: `defineBlock` accepts neither and
 * `ContainerBlockOptions` declares neither, so presence IS the proof that the
 * type went through the factory that makes both declarations mandatory. The
 * VALUES are left to tsc (`BlockAudience` and `BlockAuthor` are closed unions) —
 * restating their literals here would be a second source of truth for sets the
 * types already close.
 *
 * Handles are read by IMPORTING the same web barrels the docgen tree imports —
 * the same technique as `page-editor:anchor-has-decoration`, whose module
 * comment explains why a static source scan cannot recover a handle's fields.

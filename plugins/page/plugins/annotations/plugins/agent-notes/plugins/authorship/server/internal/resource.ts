// Server half of the per-card authorship read: a db-arm value, so the loader's
// read-set (this table) is captured at the pool chokepoint and a stamp
// recomputes every subscribed card's tuple — a FULL recompute, with no scope
// policy to route on. That is correct, and the right trade: the table's key is
// the composite `(block_id, conversation_id)`, and a surrogate id column would
// buy per-row routing at the price of a meaningless key and a separate unique
// index to make `ON CONFLICT` work, while the recompute it avoids is one indexed
// single-block query over a handful of rows, on a table written once per agent
// note. Push drops the tuples whose result did not change.
//
// The order is TOTAL (`conversation_id` breaks a `created_at` tie): a value is
// delivered in the loader's order, its first record IS the creator
// (`useAgentNotesCreator`), and push compares bytes — so two recomputes over
// the same rows must not come back in two orders.

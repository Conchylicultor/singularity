// The `context` card is a VOID container — the callout's sibling, not its
// opposite.
//
// It shipped once as a TEXT-BEARING collapsible card with an editable title row,
// and that model was rejected: one row played container identity, appearance AND
// the first line of content at once, so Enter in the title minted a second card
// and the card's first visible line could never be a HEADING. The corrected model
// is the callout's — `anchor: true`, `wrapOnConvert: true`, payload
// `z.object({})` with NO `text`. The card renders no line of its own; its
// entire displayed content is its children, ordinary blocks of any type that do
// not know they are inside it. It is still collapsible: it folds to its BORROWED
// line, which is `page/container`'s behaviour and is specced in that plugin's
// `e2e/container-collapse-verify.ts`.
//
// Every claim below is invisible to a unit test of the pure grouping — a frame is
// a `pointer-events-none` SIBLING backdrop spanning grid lines, never an ancestor
// of the rows (wrapping them would remount a block's Lexical instance whenever it
// crossed the boundary) — so all of it is asserted against live rects on the real
// editable surface.
//
//  1. THE VOID SCHEMA IS ENFORCED AT THE WRITE BOUNDARY. A `context` payload
//     carrying a `text` key is REJECTED (`parseBlockData`'s top-level `.strict()`
//     ⇒ loud 400), while `{}` is accepted. The direct inverse of the old spec's
//     first assertion, and what proves the void model is real rather than
//     aspirational: `acceptsText` is *derived* from the schema, so a stray `text`
//     surviving the boundary would mean the card is still text-bearing whatever
//     the handle claims. The 400 is checked for its REASON too — an unregistered
//     block type 400s here as well, and would otherwise pass this trivially.
//  2. NO LINE OF ITS OWN. The card's row measures ~0px high with visible children,
//     and renders NO `contenteditable` at all. That is what puts its gutter
//     decoration and its first child on ONE visual line, and it is the precise
//     DOM-level death of the rejected title row.
//  3. CHILDLESS CARD IS A VISIBLE, HIT-TESTABLE ONE-LINE BOX. `computeFrameSpans`
//     spans a childless container over its own row alone; at zero height that
//     would paint a 0px frame over a 0px row — an invisible, unclickable,
//     undeletable ghost — so the row falls back to one empty line. Asserted FIRST,
//     deliberately: `pruneEmptyAnchors` is a forest-wide post-pass on
//     `applyBlockOp`, so the very next structural keystroke on this page dissolves
//     it (exactly as in the callout spec, for exactly the same reason).
//  4. THE USER'S ACTUAL COMPLAINT: THE FIRST VISIBLE LINE CAN BE A HEADING. A card
//     whose first child is a `heading-1` still paints its box around it, the
//     heading still renders as a heading, and the topmost line inside the box IS
//     that heading. Structurally impossible under the text-bearing model, where
//     the first line was the container's own title row. The highest-value
//     assertion in this file.
//  5. ENTER INSIDE A CHILD YIELDS A SIBLING INSIDE THE BOX. Exactly one new line,
//     a child of the SAME container, and NO second container box. The regression
//     the user reported — under the old model another content line meant another
//     container.
//  6. BACKSPACE AT THE START OF THE FIRST CHILD UNWRAPS. The container dissolves
//     and ALL its children are promoted into its slot (the `unwrap` op) — box
//     gone, content kept, nothing re-nested. Distinct from Delete, which removes
//     the container WITH its subtree. The generic `isIndented` → outdent rung
//     would pop the first child out and adopt its remaining siblings as ITS
//     children, which is why this rung exists at all.
//  7. `/context` ON AN EXISTING BLOCK WRAPS IT (`wrapOnConvert: true`): the origin
//     keeps its id, type, `data` and children and becomes the card's first child;
//     a brand-new row is minted for the anchor. Keeping the origin's id is the
//     load-bearing part — its content `Y.Doc`, its `Y.UndoManager` and its
//     registered focus handle are ALL keyed by block id.
//  8. NESTING: a `context` card as the MIDDLE child of a `callout` paints BOTH
//     boxes, the callout's strictly containing the card's (above and below, one
//     indent shallower) rather than partially overlapping it.
//  9. CONVERGE in a SECOND browser context (fresh socket, cold load): the wrap and
//     the Enter-minted child are persisted structure, not view state.
//
// Two measurement conventions, both load-bearing:
//
// - A box is matched to the block that OWNS it by its top edge AND its left
//   edge, both read off that block's own row. Paint says nothing about ownership
//   any more: a context card used to be told from a callout by its DASHED
//   border, and no box is dashed now — every container paints a soft tint and
//   nothing else. The left edge replaces it and is true by construction, because
//   a frame paints its own CONTENT box: its left edge is its row's content edge
//   plus one `BLOCK_INSET`, so a card nested in a callout starts exactly one
//   `BLOCK_INDENT` to the right of the callout's box. That is what keeps the two
//   apart in the case where the tops coincide — a card that is a callout's FIRST
//   child shares its box top with the callout's own, both anchor rows being
//   zero-height at the same y. Still not by any decoration selector: the anchor's
//   own control is this plugin's business, and a spec that named it would fail
//   for a cosmetic rename rather than for a regression.
// - Rects answer "what does the user see"; the blocks API answers "what is the
//   structure". Identity, type, and parentage claims (#6, #7) read
//   `GET /api/pages/:pageId/blocks` — a content edge one indent deeper is
//   evidence of nesting, not proof of a `parentId`.

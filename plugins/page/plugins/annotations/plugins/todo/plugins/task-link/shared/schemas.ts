// answers.

// The link of ONE TODO card, read by the card's `blockId`. The table holds 0 or
// 1 row per card — its primary key IS the card (see the table's comment: one
// task per card is a fact of the schema, not a rule the endpoint remembers) —
// so it is a lookup-only collection: no default window (nothing lists every
// card's link), minting `todo-block-task:rows` alone. A card reads its row with
// `useLiveRow(todoTasks, blockId)`, and `found: false` is "not dispatched".
//
// Bounded by construction: only a MOUNTED card subscribes, a load is one
// primary-key seek, and the `:rows` point routing schedules a write for the one
// card whose row it named rather than waking every mounted card.
//
// NOT preloaded (a lookup-only collection cannot be): the card mounts
// route-scoped with its page, so it hydrates post-mount via its sub-ack.
//
// **The row id is `blockId`, the table's primary key** (stored as `parent_id`):
// the point membership intersects the ids a write touched — PK values — with
// each card's id set, so keying on `taskId` would name ids no card subscribed to.

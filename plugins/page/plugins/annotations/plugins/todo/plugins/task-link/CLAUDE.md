# task-link

**The task a TODO card dispatched an agent onto**, the launch that creates it,
and the panel behind the card's glyph.

A sub-plugin of [`todo`](../../CLAUDE.md) rather than part of the card itself,
for the reason [`authorship`](../../../agent-notes/plugins/authorship/CLAUDE.md)
is a sub-plugin of `agent-notes`: the record is about the CARD and must survive
edits to it, and it is read by a second surface (the markdown a `read_page`
returns) that has no business mounting a React panel. The card's own `data` is
`z.object({})` and must stay so.

Design: [`research/2026-08-07-page-todo-agent-dispatch.md`](../../../../../../../../research/2026-08-07-page-todo-agent-dispatch.md).

## A block-keyed extension, not a copy of `/prompt`'s link table

`page_blocks_ext_todo_task(parent_id PK → page_blocks, task_id → tasks)`.
`defineExtension` synthesizes `parent_id` as the PRIMARY KEY, and **that is what
makes "one task per TODO card" a fact of the schema** rather than a rule the
create endpoint remembers to check — i.e. rather than a rule two concurrent
dispatches can both pass. A second dispatch is an upsert onto the same key.

[`page/prompt/link`](../../../../../prompt/plugins/link/CLAUDE.md)'s
`tasks_ext_prompt_block` is 1:N on the TASK side, and that is right *there* and
wrong here, because the two blocks mean different things. A prompt block is a
re-runnable instruction — each run is its own piece of work. A TODO card is ONE
piece of work that may take several tries, and "several tries" is a concept that
already exists: `createConversation` with a `taskId` and no `attemptId` mints a
new attempt. So the many-runs axis costs this plugin no code at all — the
endpoint returns the same task id twice and the second launch is a second
attempt.

## Both FKs cascade — the opposite call its two neighbours make

`authorship` keeps a dangling `conversation_id`; `page/prompt/link` keeps a
dangling `block_id`. Both are STATEMENTS that stay true after one end dies ("an
agent wrote this card"; "this task came from a page"). This row is not a
statement, it is a **link**, and it means nothing once either end is gone:

- card deleted ⇒ nothing can ever read the row again;
- task deleted ⇒ the card is free for a fresh dispatch. That is also the only
  "detach" affordance the feature has, and keeping the row would instead bind the
  card forever to a task that no longer exists.

Growth is bounded by the `parent_id` cascade — `markCascadeBounded` asserts it at
module eval (boot-fatal). It sits in its own module because a barrel may hold no
statements and `tables.ts` must stay importable by drizzle-kit's schema loader,
which cannot pull in retention's `db`/`jobs` closure.

## The status is joined client-side, never stored

`todoTaskResource` is keyed by `{ blockId }` and carries the link and nothing
else — no title, no status. Those belong to the TASK: they change without the
link changing, and the browser already holds them on the boot-critical `tasks`
resource that the task list itself renders. Copying them here would make this row
a second, drifting answer to a question something else already answers, and every
status flip would have to remember to write two places. `useTodoTaskState` does
the join; the card's glyph then follows its task through every transition with
nothing stored on the card.

Point membership, so only a MOUNTED card pays and a FULL load is one
primary-key seek. **No `ctx.affectedIds` branch, and here that is a choice**: this
table's key is a single column, so unlike `agent-notes-authors` a scoped refill
*is* available — it would just be the same one-row seek with an `inArray` that can
only confirm or exclude the one row. There is no work to save.

## What the markdown provider emits

The `Editor.BlockAnnotation` contribution answers, for the rows a markdown read
is about to walk, with `task_id` and `status` for every dispatched `<todo>` card.
Those are the two attributes `todoBlock`'s tag declares in
`markdown.tag.annotated`, and they are the reason that mechanism exists: they are
facts about the card that live in another table, so neither the derived attribute
projection (which reads `data`) nor a declared `attrs(data, ctx)` could produce
them. What they buy is that an agent reading a page can tell a TODO somebody is
already on from one nobody has touched.

- **`status` is the raw `TaskStatus` enum** (`new` / `in_progress` /
  `need_action` / `attempted` / `done` / `held` / `dropped` / `blocked`), never a
  prettified label — so what an agent reads is the vocabulary the task list shows
  and the task tools accept, with no second dialect.
- **It is read from `tasks_v`, not `tasks`.** A task's status is COMPUTED (from
  its attempts, its conversations, its dependencies) and is no column of the base
  table. `readTaskStatus` answers for one id at a time, which would turn a page
  read into one round trip per linked card; the view is exported from
  `tasks-core/server` as `tasksView` so this can be one joined query, the same
  call `conversationsView` already makes.
- **Empty in, empty out.** A page with no TODO cards runs no query at all, rather
  than one that could only ever return nothing.
- **They are READ-ONLY**, and `claimTag` discards them on the way back in. A pure
  parser can neither tell an edited value from the one it emitted a minute ago nor
  write the table that owns it. `read_page`'s description says so generically —
  the rule is about externally-owned attributes as a family, not about TODO cards.

## The prompt is composed server-side, on every dispatch

`ensureTodoTask` reads the card through `readBlockAsMarkdown` — the same dialect
`read_page` hands the agent, so the snapshot in the prompt and what it re-reads on
the page are one text — and returns `{ taskId, prompt }`.

- **The card's text is not in the request body.** Unlike `/prompt`, whose text the
  client must send because the block row's `data.text` projection lags the CRDT
  doc by ~1s, a TODO card owns no text of its own: its content is its children,
  each with its own doc, and there is no single editor holding a fresher copy.
- **The inlined card is capped (~1500 chars) and SAYS SO when it was cut.** It is
  a convenience snapshot — the prompt tells the agent to go read the page, which
  is authoritative — so a long card would only push the instructions after it out
  of attention. A silent truncation would let an agent conclude the card asks for
  less than it does.
- **The prompt is recomposed on the reuse path too**, because the card has moved
  on since the first dispatch: a second agent must be told what it says now. Only
  the first call writes it to the task's `description`, so the task detail shows
  what the first agent was actually asked.
- **The title seed is the card's own first line, not the prompt.** The prompt
  opens with "Work on the TODO card `block-…`", so seeding from it would title
  every task after its own block id. The first line is the one thing in the whole
  payload a human wrote.
- **The category is `PAGES_CATEGORY_ID`, imported from `page/prompt/link`**, which
  owns the single `TaskCategory({ id: "pages" })` registration. One category, one
  registration; a second one here would be a duplicate id, not a new lane.

## The panel is one component registered twice

`TodoDispatch` renders as the anchor's `sections` and as the card's
`BlockFrameMeta.menu` — the documented container convention (the rail is where a
user looks for block actions, the glyph is where they look for the glyph). Its
second state is its first plus a header: the task's live title and status and a
row opening its newest conversation, with the same form below reading *Dispatch
another agent*. Transient chrome, not a DataView — one task line and one
conversation row off a `size-5` glyph, with no search / sort / filter to earn.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Reads the task a TODO card was dispatched onto (useTodoTask / useTodoTaskState, joined live to the tasks resource) and renders the card's dispatch panel — the launch form, and once dispatched the task's title, status and newest run. Contributes no slot of its own; the todo card's anchor and rail menu host it. Owns page_blocks_ext_todo_task: the ONE task a TODO card dispatches agents onto. The block-keyed link table (its primary key IS the one-task-per-card rule), the per-card live read, the idempotent dispatch endpoint that composes the agent's prompt, and the markdown provider that emits the card's task_id/status to read_page.

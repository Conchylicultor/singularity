 * resource — the same one the task list renders. So a card's glyph follows the
 * task through every status change with nothing stored on the card and nothing
 * to keep in sync, which is the same read `page/prompt/block`'s chips make
 * against `attempts`.
 *
 * A resource result: loading while either side is hydrating, error when
 * either read failed, and on the ready arm the task — or `null` when the card
 * has not been dispatched, or its task is not in the tasks resource at all.
 * That last case is not a hole to fill: the link's `task_id` FK cascades, so
 * a deleted task takes its link row with it and both reads converge on "this
 * card has not been dispatched" — which is the truth, and is what frees the
 * card for a fresh dispatch. An undispatched card settles on the link alone:
 * it has no task to look up, so the task list's state does not reach it.

 * for the glyph.
 *
 * Two states, and the second is the first plus a header rather than a different
 * surface: before a dispatch it is the launch form alone, after one it leads
 * with the task it created and the run to open, and the form below reads as
 * "dispatch another". That form is not a second way to do the same thing — the

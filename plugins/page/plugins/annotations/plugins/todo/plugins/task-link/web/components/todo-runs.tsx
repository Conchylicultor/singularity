/**
 * The agents this TODO card has dispatched, as a row of chips — what the card's
 * FOOT renders.
 *
 * ## Why the card says this at all
 *
 * Dispatching used to leave almost no trace: the card's corner name stopped
 * hiding and started spelling the task's status, and that was the whole record.
 * A word in a corner cannot say WHICH run, cannot be clicked, and says nothing
 * at all about a second attempt. The chips do all three — one per run, oldest
 * first, each opening that run in a column beside the page — which is what the
 * `/prompt` block has always shown below its text. The two blocks now say the
 * same thing the same way, through the same chip.
 *
 * The corner name went back to being just the card's name for exactly that
 * reason: the status is here, on something you can act on, and a card that
 * spelled it twice would be a card whose two answers can disagree.
 *
 * ## Nothing at rest, and nothing while hydrating
 *
 * Most TODO cards never dispatch anything, and a card that has not is unchanged
 * — no chips, no reserved row, no foot at all. `null` covers both that and "the
 * link has not loaded yet", which is the call every surface in this family makes
 * (see `useTodoTask`): a spinner per card would be noise on every page, and the
 * cost is that a freshly-opened page's chips settle a beat after it paints.
 *
 * A dispatched card whose run has not been created yet renders nothing either.
 * That window is one round trip wide and closes on its own.

/**
 * The TODO card's wash, covering the card's own (zero-height) anchor row
 * AND every block nested inside it.
 *
 * `ContainerBackdrop` owns the geometry, so this file declares nothing but the
 * look, and the frame rules (`BlockFrameProps`) hold by construction: the
 * backdrop fills the box the surface measured — the card's own content box —
 * never `h-full`, and adds no horizontal offset of its own. Semantic theme
 * tokens only, so a preset switch restyles it for free.
 *
 * ## The hue follows the linked task, and stops shouting when it settles
 *
 * A soft wash with no border and no icon, like every card in the family. The hue
 * is the family's "outstanding work" `warning` until the card's
 * task says otherwise: `done` repaints it `success`, `dropped` fades it to
 * `muted`. Every other status (including no task at all) is still outstanding
 * work and still warning. So a finished TODO stops competing for attention
 * without disappearing from the page.
 *
 * The status lives beside the row, not in it — a side table keyed by block id
 * joined to the task — which is what `BlockFrameProps.blockId` exists for. A
 * node carrying no id (a forest with no rows behind it) has nothing to look up
 * and paints the static `warning` box.
 *
 * A read-only surface that DOES carry ids (the version-history preview) tints
 * from the card's task as it stands NOW, not as it stood in the snapshot. That
 * is deliberate and not the same lie the prompt block's launch chips would be:
 * the box says what remains to be done about this card, which is a fact about
 * the card today whichever revision of its text you are reading.

/**
 * The TODO card's name, in the top-right corner of its box — and the way an
 * agent is dispatched onto it.
 *
 * ## The name IS the launch control
 *
 * Most TODO cards never launch anything, so a launch button that is always on
 * screen is a permanent price for a rare act. This adds nothing at rest: point
 * at the card and it says `TODO`; move onto that word and it becomes
 * `▷ LAUNCH`, in place, at the same size. The answer to *what is this box* turns
 * into the affordance, so the card gains no control at all — the one it already
 * had changes what it says.
 *
 * The panel behind it is unchanged and unmoved: the same `TodoDispatch` that the
 * rail's block-actions menu opens (`BlockFrameMeta.menu`), which is the
 * container convention — the rail is where a user looks for block actions, the
 * decoration is where they look for the decoration.
 *
 * ## The name is the card's NAME again, dispatched or not
 *
 * It used to make one exception: a dispatched card stopped hiding its name and
 * spelled the task's live status there instead (`RUNNING`, `DONE`), because the
 * tint cannot say it — an open card and a card with an agent working on it are
 * both `warning` — and nothing else on the card could.
 *
 * Something else can now. The card's FOOT carries a chip per run
 * (`BlockFrameMeta.foot` → `TodoFoot`), which says the same thing on something
 * you can click to go and look. So the exception is gone: the name is worth
 * nothing at rest whatever the task is doing, and a card that spelled the status
 * in two places would be a card whose two answers can drift apart the day a
 * status is added.
 *
 * The link is still read here for one thing only — whether launching again is
 * *again* — which is a fact about this control's own wording, not a second
 * rendering of the task's state.
 *
 * ## Three states, and the two degradations are the same one
 *
 * `blockId` and `editor` are both optional on `BlockAnchorProps` and both absent
 * on a read-only surface (the blog renderer, the version-history preview): a
 * read-only node may carry no id, and there is no block API to hand a popover.
 * Either one missing ⇒ the static name, unchanged from before. Dispatching is
 * live agent state, so a snapshot of last Tuesday must not offer it — and the
 * panel would crash rather than degrade there anyway (`useOpenPane` /
 * `conversationPane.useRouteEntries()` do not exist on the public-site surface).

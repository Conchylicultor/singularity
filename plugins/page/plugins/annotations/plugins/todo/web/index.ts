    "TODO block type: a void CONTAINER whose soft-tinted box wraps blocks of any type nested inside it, marking a region of work agents still have to do. Also minted by typing `TODO ` at the start of a line. Its corner name and its rail menu open the dispatch panel, and the box and that name follow the dispatched task's live status.",

    // The card renders NO row of its own — `BlockRow`'s anchored branch never
    // dispatches `Editor.Block` for an `anchor` type, so the container
    // primitive's shared null renderer is unreachable. The registration itself is
    // where the HANDLE lives, and the handle is what the insert palette, the
    // markdown pipeline, paste, the turn-into list, `useAnchorTypes()` and the
    // markdown-shortcut plugin (this block's `TODO ` prefix) all read.

    // derived from this slot's registered matches (`useFramedBlockTypes()`), so
    // there is no second "I am a container" flag to drift from who actually
    // paints a box. `anchor` rides on the SAME registration
    // (`./singularity check page-editor:anchor-has-decoration`).
    // `menu` rides on the SAME registration for the same reason `anchor` does:
    // the card's two surfaces (its glyph, and the rail popover on the line it
    // borrows) cannot drift from who paints the box. Both render the SAME
    // dispatch panel, deliberately — the rail is where a user looks for a
    // block's actions, the glyph is where they look for the glyph. The
    // structural half of that popover (Collapse / Remove TODO / Delete) stays
    // generic and is contributed by nobody.

/**
 * How the page tools hand an agent the instructions that cover a page
 * (`research/2026-09-17-page-agent-instructions.md` §4–5).
 *
 * The `instructions` plugin answers WHICH instructions cover a page and which of
 * them a conversation has not received at their current hash. This module is
 * the agent-facing half: how they are worded, when they count as received, and
 * the rule that a write under a page waits until they have been.
 *
 * Three moments deliver them, and each marks what it handed over:
 *
 * - **A read** puts the undelivered ones in a `<received-instructions>` block
 *   ahead of the page ({@link deliverWithRead}). An instructions block the read
 *   already shows whole is not repeated there — the read itself delivers it.
 * - **A write** under a page with undelivered instructions is refused before it
 *   plans anything, and the refusal carries them ({@link assertInstructionsReceived}).
 *   The refusal is the delivery, so the retry goes through.
 * - **Conversation start** carries the GLOBAL ones ({@link renderGlobalSection}):
 *   cards in full, pages as pointers to read.

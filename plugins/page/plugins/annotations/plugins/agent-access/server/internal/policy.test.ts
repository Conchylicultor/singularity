/**
 * The policy rules, over a fixture forest and hand-built plans.
 *
 * The annotation handles are THROWAWAY, registered through the real
 * `defineAnnotationBlock` — the point being that nothing here names a concrete
 * plugin's type: the rules enumerate `audience === "human"` and `author` off the
 * registry, so a type invented in this file is treated exactly like `/private`
 * or `/human`. A test that seeded the real four would prove the rules work for
 * the four we have, which is the weaker claim.
 *
 * `agent-note` is the one exception, on both sides: its tag is what a refusal
 * tells an agent to mint, so the fixture uses the real handle. So is `page`: an
 * agent-authored page declares its author through its own data
 * (`pageBlockHandle`'s `authorFromData`), and that per-row answer is exactly
 * what the cases below it pin.
 *
 * The two throwaways cover the two cells that matter to the write rule. Only
 * `author` decides a boundary, so `zz-authored` — agent-audience, human-authored
 * — is the interesting one: an agent READS it and may not write it, which is the
 * `/human` and `/todo` cell and the reason `author` exists as a separate
 * question from `audience`.

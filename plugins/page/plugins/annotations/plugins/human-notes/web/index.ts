    // The card renders NO row of its own — `BlockRow`'s anchored branch never
    // dispatches `Editor.Block` for an `anchor` type, so the container
    // primitive's shared null renderer is unreachable. The registration itself is
    // where the HANDLE lives, and the handle is what the insert palette, the
    // markdown pipeline, paste, the turn-into list and `useAnchorTypes()` (the
    // reducer's `anchorTypes`) all read.
    //
    // The id is the block's TYPE, which is why the type is still `context` after
    // the rename: reorder's persisted per-slot directives are keyed by
    // contribution id, so a new id would silently discard whatever ordering and
    // visibility a user had configured for this card.

    // derived from this slot's registered matches (`useFramedBlockTypes()`), so
    // there is no second "I am a container" flag to drift from who actually
    // paints a box. the DECORATION rides on the SAME registration, so the handle's
    // `anchor: true` cannot claim one that nothing supplies. This family asks for
    // the CORNER seat — the card's own name, revealed only while the pointer is
    // inside its box — where the callout asks for the gutter glyph.

/**
 * Define an ANNOTATION block type: a void container that carries part of the
 * page's human↔agent side-channel, and therefore declares both of the page's
 * parties — who its content is for, and whose words it holds.
 *
 * It is `defineContainerBlock` plus exactly two REQUIRED fields, and the
 * requirement is the whole mechanism:
 *
 * > **An annotation cannot be unmarked, on either axis.** There is no default to
 * > leak through, and none to be silently frozen by.
 *
 * The fail-safe direction the family doc demands ("the failure mode of a future
 * annotation is *the agent didn't see it*, never *the private card leaked*") is
 * therefore reached by making the unmarked state UNREPRESENTABLE rather than by
 * defaulting it. A default would be a value some consumer eventually has to
 * interpret; a required field is a compile error at the one site that knows the
 * answer.
 *
 * The two absent-value defaults it makes unreachable point in OPPOSITE
 * directions — absent `audience` is visible to everyone, absent `author` is the
 * human's — which is precisely why neither can be derived from the other and why
 * both have to be asked (see `BlockHandle.author` for the table). What they have
 * in common is only that both are right for ORDINARY PROSE and wrong for an
 * annotation: a card that fell through them would be a paragraph, and this
 * family exists because the page has things in it that are not paragraphs.
 *
 * Enforcement has two halves, neither sufficient alone:
 *
 * - this signature, which a new annotation written through this factory cannot
 *   satisfy without answering both questions;
 * - the `annotations:parties-declared` check, which is what stops a new
 *   annotation from reaching for `defineContainerBlock` directly and quietly
 *   being an ordinary container — the case the signature cannot see.
 *
 * Neither field is threaded through `ContainerBlockOptions`, deliberately, and
 * for the same reason. A callout or a quote has no audience and no author — they
 * are ordinary prose — so widening the container surface would both invite a
 * meaningless declaration and destroy the check's discriminator: presence of
 * either field on a handle is exactly the proof that it came through here,
 * because nothing else can set them.

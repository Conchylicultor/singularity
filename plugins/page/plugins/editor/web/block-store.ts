// The persistence seam for the block editor. `BlockEditorProvider` consumes a
// `BlockStore` for ALL reads/writes and is otherwise storage-agnostic: recording/
// undo, focus management, and `makeBlockAPI` never touch a store's internals.
//
// Two implementations share one shape:
//   - `useServerBlockStore`  — the persistent path: the
//     `useOptimisticResource(pageBlocks, { pageId }, …)` overlay, and nothing else.
//   - `useMemoryBlockStore`  — an authoritative in-memory `useState<Block[]>`,
//     the source of truth itself (no overlay, no confirmation, no network). Its
//     writes reuse the SAME pure helpers as the server (`applyOverlayOp`, the
//     reducer), so op/patch semantics are byte-identical.

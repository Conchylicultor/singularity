/**
 * How a **void** block — one owning no editable text — takes part in the
 * editor's caret model, in one place instead of hand-copied per block type.
 *
 * A text-bearing block gets all of this for free: its Lexical editor IS the
 * focusable node, the browser paints a caret in it, and the shared text
 * renderer registers its focus handle. A void block has none of that, and the
 * eight media types proved what "each block does its own" costs — image, video,
 * audio, file, embed, bookmark, place and page-link each registered nothing at
 * all, so `navigate()` skipped them and the caret jumped over content the user
 * could plainly see and click into.
 *
 * So the split here is no longer "the plumbing, for whoever remembers to call
 * it". It is:
 *
 * - {@link BlockCaretHost} — what the EDITOR mounts around a block's row when
 *   the type registers `caret: "editor"`. The block writes no caret code at all:
 *   focusability, arrow navigation, the caret cue, Backspace and Enter all come
 *   from here. This is the answer for every block whose payload is an object the
 *   user looks at rather than types into.
 * - {@link useVoidCaret} — the plumbing, for the few types that must hold the
 *   caret somewhere only they know about (`caret: "renderer"`: a `<textarea>` of
 *   source, a `Row`'s synthesized inner control). It takes a focus
 *   **capability** rather than a node, which is exactly what lets one hook serve
 *   all of them without knowing about any of them.
 * - {@link useCaretEscape} — the ↑/↓ escape on its own, for those same types.
 *   "The caret can always leave a void block" is the EDITOR's invariant, so it
 *   is spelled once here rather than re-derived by each block that needs it. It
 *   is a separate export rather than a field on {@link useVoidCaret}'s result
 *   because the textarea types must NOT take it — their arrows move through
 *   their own source — and "don't spread that field" is a discipline, whereas
 *   "don't call that hook" is a spelling.
 * - {@link useBlockActivate} — how a render state tells the host what Enter
 *   means on it.

 * fires no focus event and moves no caret, so the guard bought nothing. It is
 * also unspellable here — this holds a capability, not a node, and there is
 * nothing to compare `activeElement` against.
 *
 * That is NOT the same question as the two guards {@link BlockCaretHost} adds

/**
 * The focusable box that holds the caret for a `caret: "editor"` block, and
 * **the one place the "the caret is on this block" cue is written**.
 *
 * Mounted by `BlockRow` around the block's dispatch, never by the block. It adds
 * **no padding of its own**: it sits at the row's content-left edge `C`, which
 * is where the page-column invariant puts a block DECORATION, and the caret cue
 * is one. Every block keeps its own `<Inset x={BLOCK_INSET}>` for its content.
 *
 * ## The cue
 *
 * Two visual conditions, deliberately SEPARATE, and they layer:
 *
 * - `focus-ring` is the app's canonical indicator for "this element has DOM
 *   keyboard focus" — and it is the same utility that suppresses the browser's
 *   own outline, so the replacement is drawn on **exactly the condition the
 *   original was suppressed for**.
 * - `bg-accent` is "the editor's caret is on this block". It is the tint
 *   `Row.selected` paints, so a void block that delegates to `Row` (sub-page)
 *   and one that takes this host say the same thing the same way. It is also a
 *   different hue from the block-SELECTION band (`bg-primary/15`), which is the
 *   app's existing two-cue language rather than a coincidence.
 *
 * That separation is a bug this closes. The divider used to write `outline-none`
 * unconditionally and then draw a ring on `isFocused` — a *different* condition
 * — so a box that had genuinely taken keyboard focus while the editor's model
 * disagreed showed **nothing at all**.
 *
 * ## Focus: three rules, three different questions
 *
 * `useVoidCaret` answers "the model moved, so move the DOM". Wrapping
 * INTERACTIVE content — which a media block is full of — makes two more
 * questions askable that a divider never had to answer:
 *
 * 1. **Focus is already inside me.** Clicking "Remove image" focuses the button,
 *    which bubbles here, which makes this block the current one, which flips
 *    `isFocused` — and the pull would then yank focus off the button the user
 *    just clicked. So the focus capability declines when
 *    `contains(document.activeElement)`. This is a CONTAINMENT question and is
 *    load-bearing, unlike the identity guard `useVoidCaret` documents dropping.
 *    It cannot see through a **portal**, and nothing here can: a popover
 *    rendered to `document.body` is not a descendant. That is why a block whose
 *    affordance is a popover opens it from its own {@link useBlockActivate}
 *    rather than auto-opening on mount — an auto-open would race this.
 * 2. **Focus went nowhere.** The block's own control can unmount under the
 *    user's feet: "Remove image" clears the payload, so the button that was
 *    focused disappears and DOM focus falls to `<body>`. `isFocused` never
 *    changed, so rule 1's effect never re-runs, and the model says the caret is
 *    on this block while the keyboard is nowhere — arrows dead until the user
 *    clicks again. So focus is reclaimed on every commit, but ONLY from `null` /
 *    `<body>`. Not "anywhere outside this row": that would steal from a portal,
 *    which is rule 1's blind spot arriving by a different road.
 *
 * ## Keys: escapes are unconditional, meanings are the box's own
 *
 * The split matters, and getting it wrong strands the caret. A single origin
 * guard (`e.target === e.currentTarget`, the discipline the block-selection
 * container uses) would mean that once focus is on any inner control — the
 * upload dropzone, a URL field, a link — ↑/↓ reach nothing at all and the user
 * cannot leave the block by keyboard. So:
 *
 * - **↑/↓ and Escape run wherever they originated**, subject only to
 *   `defaultPrevented`. That is the protocol: an inner control that genuinely
 *   wants the arrows says so by preventing default, which is exactly what the
 *   place block's result list already does while its suggestions are open.
 * - **Backspace/Delete/Enter/Space are origin-guarded**, so typing in an inner
 *   field is never swallowed by the block around it.
 *
 * Backspace deletes the whole block in one press, whatever its payload holds: a
 * filled image is ONE object, not content to clear and then a block to delete.
 * (Clearing the payload is what the block's own "Remove"/"Replace" button is
 * for. Two affordances, two meanings, deliberately.) The caret lands above,
 * which is where the user's line then is — Notion's model, and it makes a
 * Backspace arriving from the block below read as one continuous motion.

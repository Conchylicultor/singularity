/**
 * Recover a block whose rendered text no longer agrees with its content doc or
 * with the server, and report it. Two independent triggers, because either side
 * can be the one that fell behind and each is observable from a different place:
 *
 * - **blind binding** — driven by a content-doc update (the doc is the thing
 *   that moved), settled and then compared against what THIS editor renders;
 * - **starved doc** — driven by the ROW, the other independent witness of the
 *   block's content: a `data.text` push carrying text while this client's doc
 *   is empty, the transport has ALREADY ANSWERED, and nothing here ever typed
 *   into it. Row-driven precisely because a starved doc receives no doc updates
 *   at all, so the doc-side trigger can never fire for it.
 *
 * Two things keep the second trigger honest, and each closes a whole class of
 * false positive:
 *
 * - **`isSynced`** — the transport's own witness that an authoritative answer
 *   landed. Before it, an empty doc proves NOTHING: the push is simply still on
 *   its way, and "still coming" is indistinguishable from "never arriving"
 *   except by asking the transport. Calling slow "broken" is what made this arm
 *   fire on healthy cold opens.
 * - **`hasLocalEdits`** — a doc the user just emptied legitimately trails its
 *   own ~1 s row projection.
 *
 * **The repair differs per arm, and that is the point.** `rehydrate()` ends the
 * session and mints a fresh EMPTY replica, so the text genuinely leaves the DOM
 * until the re-read lands. That is the ONLY cure for a binding that missed its
 * post-attach `observeDeep` set (`blind-binding`) — and pure damage for a doc
 * that is merely behind the server, whose binding is working perfectly. So:
 *
 * - `blind-binding` → `rehydrate()` (re-attach: the defect is the binding);
 * - `starved-doc` → `refetch()` (re-read into the live doc, nothing on screen
 *   moves — see {@link CollabBlockDoc.refetch});
 * - the user-pressed `stalled` Retry → `rehydrate()` (they asked for the big
 *   hammer, and `stalled` IS a binding defect).
 *
 * The guard is purely a DETECTOR: it does not stand in front of the projection
 * write, because the projection reads the doc rather than this editor and so
 * can no longer persist a blind binding's emptiness (R1 of
 * `research/2026-08-03-page-block-content-session-one-owner.md`). What is left
 * is a real, recoverable RENDER defect — reported and healed in place, retired
 * in the stage that makes hydration a proven request/response.

/**
 * The block-selection highlight: one translucent region per selected RUN,
 * painted as a sibling decoration over the block list's grid.
 *
 * The shape (why a run and not a per-row class) is `internal/selection-bands.ts`'s
 * business; this file owns only the appearance, and it is deliberately quiet:
 *
 *  - **A tint, no outline.** An outline is a boundary, and the boundary the user
 *    cares about is the run's — not each block's. Drawing one per row is what
 *    made a plain three-paragraph selection read as three stacked cards.
 *  - **Rounded only where the run actually ends**, so the lines in the middle of
 *    a selection are continuous.
 *  - **`C` to the content box's right edge** — the same box a container's
 *    backdrop fills, so a selected callout's tint and its selection band are
 *    concentric rather than offset by a few pixels.
 *
 * Emitted after the container frames and before the rows, so it tints a
 * container's own decoration while the text stays fully legible above it.

/**
 * Unified, Notion-style block menu built on the shared caret-trigger primitive.
 * It opens EITHER of two ways, sharing ONE caret-anchored surface + one keyboard
 * model:
 *
 * - **`/` trigger** — typing `/` at a word boundary opens it; the text after the
 *   `/` filters it (`useCaretQuery`). `canOpen: atWordBoundary` keeps it from
 *   firing on `/` inside URLs (`http://`), dates (`06/15`), paths, or fractions;
 *   a `/` followed by a space is a literal slash.
 * - **Gutter `+` draft** — the gutter `+` inserts an empty paragraph below,
 *   focuses it, and flags it as the draft (`blockMenuDraftId`). This block's
 *   `useForcedCaretQuery` force-opens the same surface, filtered by the block's
 *   OWN text before the caret. Esc / outside-press clears the draft (keeping the
 *   block); the placeholder reads "Type to filter" while it is open.
 *
 * On commit the query span is stripped and the block is converted in place: the
 * `/` flow keeps the text around the slash; the draft flow drops the whole text
 * before the caret (it was pure filter, not content). Both go through the ONE
 * `convertStrippingText` primitive — the strip is a CONTENT-DOC edit (text has a
 * single owner), never a row payload the type write carries.
 *
 * The list also carries contributed `Editor.InsertAction`s, ranked among the
 * block types by the same filter. Committing one consumes the same span by the
 * same rule (`stripText`, the strip half alone) and then hands the line to the
 * action's `run` instead of converting it.

/**
 * The ONE way a page block may own a plain-text editing surface.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * A block whose content is source rather than prose — a code block, an
 * equation — cannot put its text in Lexical, so it renders a `<textarea>` and
 * has to re-derive by hand everything a text block gets from the editor. Two
 * types did that independently and produced the SAME bug, byte for byte:
 * pasting into a code block could not be undone.
 *
 * The chain is worth stating, because every rule below is one of its links:
 *
 * 1. The textarea declares no undo owner, so `resolveUndoOwner` walks up to the
 *    page body's `surfaceUndoProps` and `mod+z` resolves to the SURFACE. The
 *    shortcut manager then calls `preventDefault()`, killing the browser's own
 *    textarea history — the one that handles a paste correctly.
 * 2. Nothing took its place for up to 500 ms, because the only thing recording
 *    was `editor.update()`, called from a DEBOUNCED autosave. A Cmd+Z inside
 *    that window reversed an unrelated earlier document edit while the pasted
 *    text sat untouched.
 * 3. Even after the debounce, the undo was invisible: the autosave hook
 *    (`useEditableField`) dropped every external write while its field had
 *    focus, so the reverted value never reached the textarea — and the next
 *    blur flushed the stale draft back over it.
 *
 * So the fix is not "record from the block too". It is that **recording and
 * persisting are separated, and only this primitive can spell either**:
 * recording is SYNCHRONOUS, on the keystroke; persisting is debounced and puts
 * nothing on the stack. A block renderer no longer writes any of it, so a sixth
 * instance of the bug has nowhere to be written.
 *
 * **Link 3 has since been fixed at its own source** — `useEditableField` now
 * asks whether the draft holds unsaved edits rather than whether the field has
 * focus, adopting a clean draft's external write and reporting a `conflict`
 * otherwise. That does NOT make this primitive redundant, and link 2 is why: a
 * debounced autosave hook is the wrong SHAPE for a surface editing at input
 * frequency, whatever it does about external writes. Undo has to exist for the
 * keystroke you just typed, so recording must be synchronous with it — which
 * means recording and persisting cannot be the same call, which is the one
 * thing an autosave hook cannot offer.
 *
 * ## What it owns
 *
 * - **The draft**, rendered at input frequency. Deliberately not
 *   `useEditableField`: its debounce IS link 2 above — the half that still
 *   rules it out — and its mirror effect WAS link 3, since fixed on its own.
 * - **Synchronous undo recording** onto the document's own stack
 *   (`useScopedUndoRedo`). `recordEntry` pins the top entry's `undo` to the
 *   start of a run and adopts each new `redo`, so recording per keystroke does
 *   not grow the stack: a typing run is one step, and a pause past the coalesce
 *   window starts the next. SCOPED, because the thunks close over this mount's
 *   draft — after unmount there is nothing for them to set.
 *
 *   The coalesce key is `block-text:<blockId>`, not the bare `blockId` it looks
 *   like it should be. `BlockEditorAPI.update` → `commitRow` already records the
 *   block's ROW-DATA edits under that id, and the merge rule above keeps the
 *   first entry's `undo` while adopting the newest `redo` — so two owners
 *   sharing one key splice the undo of one action onto the redo of another (a
 *   language pick, then typing inside the window, gives one entry that undoes
 *   the language and redoes the text). One owner per key; namespace yours.
 * - **Undo/redo that set the draft AND the row**, plus the SELECTION. The
 *   editor's own `caretOffset` → `focusBlock` path only focuses a void block;
 *   it cannot restore a textarea's selection, so the primitive must.
 * - **Debounced persist**, through `commitRecordedRowData` — the row write that
 *   deliberately records nothing, because the entry already exists. A second
 *   entry from the timer would make one burst cost two Cmd+Z, the first of them
 *   reverting the row while this control kept rendering its own draft.
 * - **Void-caret registration.** `useVoidCaret` is called HERE, and its
 *   `onFocus` is already wired into the returned props — a block cannot forget
 *   it and be skipped by `navigate()`. Which is what the code block itself did
 *   before that hook existed: it pulled DOM focus on `isFocused` but registered
 *   no handle, so arrowing past it skipped it while a click could still focus
 *   it.
 * - **The boundary keys** — Backspace at empty, ↑ at offset 0, ↓ at the end —
 *   which both blocks duplicated verbatim.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT own
 *
 * Everything block-specific: the code block's shiki underlay and its shared
 * `METRICS` caret-alignment contract, its language picker, its Tab→two-spaces
 * and its copy button; the equation's KaTeX preview, its Enter-commits and its
 * display/edit toggle. A caller adds keys through `onKeyDown`, which runs
 * BEFORE the boundary handling so `preventDefault()` wins.

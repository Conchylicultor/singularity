  //    first child share one line. The row is `relative` and nothing in the
  //    chain clips, so the absolutely-positioned column escapes it fine.
  //  - **A one-line box when childless.** `computeFrameSpans` deliberately spans
  //    a childless container over its own row alone, so at zero height the frame

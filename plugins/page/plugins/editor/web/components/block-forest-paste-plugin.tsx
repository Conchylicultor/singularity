/**
 * Invisible Lexical plugin that makes a caret-in-block paste honor the block
 * clipboard, so it matches the block-selection-mode container paste
 * (`block-editor.tsx`). Without it, Lexical's default RichText paste dumps a
 * copied forest's `text/plain` fallback into ONE block's Y.Doc, breaking
 * one-paragraph-per-block. On `PASTE_COMMAND` it resolves the clipboard shape via
 * `decideTransfer` — the same classifier the container's paste and DROP doors
 * run — with `inline: true`, because a caret IS an insertion point:
 *  - a pasted FILE → `return false` (BlockPastePlugin owns it; the early bail
 *    makes registration order irrelevant);
 *  - text with a newline (parsed as markdown) → `preventDefault` and SPLICE
 *    the forest in at the selection: the text before it keeps its line and
 *    absorbs a leading paragraph, the text after it lands at the end of the
 *    pasted content (`planSplice`). A range selection is replaced — its span
 *    is cut from the runs the splice reads;
 *  - a `BLOCKS_MIME` forest → the same splice at the granularity its payload
 *    states: a block copied WHOLE lands as whole lines after the caret's line
 *    (or in place of an empty one), never merged into its text — which is what
 *    keeps a bare-caret Cmd+C, Cmd+V a two-keystroke duplicate;
 *  - newline-free text → `return false` (native inline paste is left
 *    untouched: text with no line in it carries no structure to splice).
 *
 * The splice is what makes `The plugin system⏎` pasted into an empty line fill
 * THAT line rather than land in a new block below an empty one — and `a⏎b`
 * pasted at `foo|bar` read `fooa`, `bbar`, with the caret after `b`.
 *
 * Registered at `COMMAND_PRIORITY_NORMAL` (like BlockPastePlugin) so multi-line /
 * forest pastes beat the bare-URL handler (LOW) and the default RichText paste
 * (LOW). An empty parsed forest (whitespace-only multi-line text) declines
 * without `preventDefault`, so the event is never swallowed for nothing.

/**
 * Invisible Lexical plugin giving the caret-in-block clipboard its missing half:
 *
 * > With NOTHING selected, the caret's own block IS the selection.
 *
 * So Cmd/Ctrl+C on a caret copies the whole block (and its subtree), Cmd/Ctrl+X
 * copies it and removes it, and the existing `BlockForestPastePlugin` lands the
 * result after the block the caret is in — which is what makes "copy, paste,
 * duplicated" a two-keystroke gesture without ever leaving the text. It is the
 * caret twin of block-selection mode's `onCopy`/`onCut` (`block-editor.tsx`) and
 * writes the identical clipboard payload through `writeForestToClipboard`.
 *
 * **A real text range is still the user's**: a non-collapsed selection declines
 * (`return false`) and the browser's own copy/cut runs untouched, marks and all.
 * Only the collapsed case — where the native copy has nothing to copy and is a
 * silent no-op — is claimed. That single condition is the whole rule; there is no
 * modifier to learn and nothing to toggle.
 *
 * **"Nothing selected" is a fact about the DOCUMENT's selection**, and both
 * halves have to agree before this claims the event — see
 * {@link selectionIsCollapsed}. Lexical's model is synced from the DOM on
 * `selectionchange`, one task LATER than the keystroke that moved it, so between
 * a one-step selection gesture (Shift+Home, ⌘A, a drag, a triple-click) and the
 * very next key the model still describes the pre-gesture caret — collapsed.
 * Asking it alone made ⌘C right after Shift+Home copy the whole BLOCK (which
 * then pasted as a new block below, instead of the selected text landing
 * inline), and ⌘X delete it. Repeated Shift+Arrow hid it: after the first press
 * the model is one step stale rather than collapsed, which is exactly why the
 * defect read as "only whole-line selections are wrong".
 *
 * Registered at `COMMAND_PRIORITY_NORMAL`, above `@lexical/rich-text`'s own
 * copy/cut handlers (`COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR`), the same rung
 * `BlockForestPastePlugin` uses on the paste side.
 *
 * Scope note: it copies the block the CARET is in, never the container that
 * block may sit inside. The rail's menu resolves to the seat's owner instead —
 * deliberately: the rail acts on a line's structure, the keyboard acts on the
 * line you are standing in. To copy a whole container, select it as a block.

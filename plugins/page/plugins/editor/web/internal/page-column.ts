/**
 * The single declaration site for the page column's horizontal geometry.
 *
 * The invariant — a page's **block content box** has a left edge `C`:
 * - `C` is the **origin** the surface computes and the rail seats against; it is
 *   where a block's box is *measured from*, not where paint lands.
 * - Block **content** (text, media) insets from `C` by `BLOCK_INSET`.
 * - Block **decorations paint that same content box**, so a box's own edge and
 *   the first letter of the prose above it share one x. A code block's
 *   background, a place block's card and a container's frame all sit at
 *   `[C + BLOCK_INSET, R]` — see `frameBoxLeft`, which is how the container
 *   family says it. How far the CONTENT of such a box then stays off its edges
 *   is a separate question, and a separate declaration: `FRAME_PAD_X` /
 *   `FRAME_PAD_Y` at the foot of this file. Alignment places the edge; it has no
 *   opinion about padding, and for a while nothing else did either.
 * - Anything a host renders *alongside* blocks that is not itself a block — the
 *   page title, the page icon, the section list — sits at `C + BLOCK_INSET`.
 *
 * This used to read "block decorations start at `C`", and the container frame
 * was the only thing that believed it: an ordinary decorated block (code, place)
 * paints inside its own `<Inset x={BLOCK_INSET}>` content box and always did.
 * So a callout's tint stood `BLOCK_INSET` to the LEFT of every paragraph on the
 * page, and of every other decorated box. Measured, then fixed — the container
 * frame now paints what everything else paints.
 *
 * The editable surface puts the hover rail (`BLOCK_GUTTER`) to the *left* of
 * `C`, inside each row's own padding — that placement is editable-surface-only
 * (the read-only renderer has no rail, so `C` is simply its left edge). Each row
 * reserves the rail as its OWN padding-left (not the list container's) so the
 * rail is inside the row's box: the hover controls (+ / drag / chevron) sit at
 * -60/-40/-20 from the content edge of its **outermost enclosing container
 * frame** — which for an unframed row is its own — and the pointer entering the
 * rail from anywhere, including from the far left or across the gap left by an
 * absent chevron, hovers the row and reveals them. Reserving the rail on the
 * container instead would put it outside every row, and since the controls are
 * `pointer-events-none` while hidden, nothing under the pointer could ever
 * reveal them. `BLOCK_GUTTER` must stay wider than the leftmost button's offset.
 *
 * The outermost-frame rule (rather than the simpler "its own content edge") is
 * forced by container ANCHORS: an anchor's decoration column occupies
 * `[C, C+BLOCK_INDENT]`, which is exactly where its first child's chevron would
 * sit if that child seated its rail against its own edge — and the child's row
 * comes later in DOM order at the same `z-raised` level, so the decoration would
 * not merely be overlapped, it would be unclickable. Seating a framed row's rail
 * against the frame's edge puts the controls OUTSIDE the box, leaving the
 * decoration column free. `BlockRow` takes the resolved seat as a prop; the
 * editor derives it from the frame spans it already computes, so rows still
 * compute no geometry of their own.
 *
 * That SPAN rule is geometry and nothing else — it says where the controls sit,
 * never what they act on. WHICH block a row's rail targets is a separate
 * BORROW-CHAIN rule, because only a container's borrowed first LINE hands its
 * rail over while lines 2..n inside the same frame keep their own. Both live on
 * `RailSeat` (`internal/rail-seat.ts`); conflating them is what let the drag
 * handle on a callout's first line pull that line out of the box.
 *
 * Hosts must never re-derive the content edge from `BLOCK_GUTTER` plus whatever
 * padding their wrapper happens to carry — they align onto it via
 * `PageContentColumn` / `BLOCK_INSET`, and `BLOCK_GUTTER` is editor-internal.

/**
 * The card's inner PADDING — the gap between the box a container frame paints
 * and the text inside it. Declared here, once, on both axes, and read by every
 * side of every box: the four sides can no longer disagree because there is
 * nothing for them to disagree about.
 *
 * It was introduced because they did. The box's edges and its content's edges
 * used to be computed independently, from quantities chosen for ALIGNMENT, and
 * whatever fell out between them became the padding by accident: measured on a
 * real page, a card had 24px on the left, **0 on the right, and 0 top and
 * bottom** — text landing exactly on its own tint, which reads as a clipping
 * bug. Alignment says where the box's EDGE goes; it has no opinion about how far
 * the content must stay off it, and nothing else had one either.
 *
 * ## The left side had to be BOUGHT before this could be a free number
 *
 * A card's contents are its CHILDREN, one indent level deeper, and its box
 * starts on the prose x — so the left gap is `BLOCK_INDENT` and the frame cannot
 * shrink it by declaring anything. The first version of this constant conceded
 * that and pinned itself to `BLOCK_INDENT`, making the other three sides agree
 * with the one side that was already decided. It measured 24px against the
 * design's 16, and read as visibly heavier than the mock it came from.
 *
 * So the frame ABSORBS that indent step and spends it as padding instead:
 * `blockContentLeft` pulls a framed row's content edge back by
 * `BLOCK_INDENT - FRAME_PAD_X` per absorbing frame. The box's own edge does not
 * move (it is still the prose x), nesting still opens one pad per level, and the
 * number is finally free.
 *
 * **A frame may only absorb a column nothing is standing in.** A container whose
 * decoration is a GUTTER GLYPH (the callout's icon) puts that glyph in exactly
 * this column, sized to `BLOCK_INDENT`; reclaiming it would crop the icon. So
 * absorption is gated on the decoration SEAT — corner-seat containers (the
 * annotation cards) absorb, gutter-seat ones keep the column their glyph
 * occupies. Derived from the seat rather than declared a second time, so a
 * container cannot claim a column it also draws in.
 *
 * ## Why Y is smaller than X
 *
 * A horizontal gap is measured to a GLYPH; a vertical one to a LINE BOX, which
 * already carries the row's own `py-xs` at each end plus half the line's
 * leading. Equal numbers would not read as equal — the effective vertical gap is
 * `FRAME_PAD_Y` plus all of that. A token rather than px, so the vertical rhythm
 * follows the density preset exactly as the lines it separates do.

 * it is clearing. Two counts are in play and they differ by exactly one, which
 * is the padding:
 *
 * - a **row** passes the frames ENCLOSING it (its own included when it is a
 *   padded container's anchor) and reserves that as `padding-right`;
 * - a **frame** passes the frames enclosing it with **its own excluded**, and
 *   pulls its box's right edge in by that.
 *
 * So the innermost box ends one pad outside the text it wraps, and each box
 * further out ends one pad outside the box it wraps — the same ladder the left
 * edge already climbs by `BLOCK_INDENT`.
 *
 * This used to be one count for both, which is exactly how the right gap became
 * zero: the reserve equalled the pull, and the two edges landed on the same x.

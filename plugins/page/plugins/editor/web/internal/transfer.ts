 *  - `inline`   — newline-free text landing at an insertion point; leave the
 *                 native inline paste/drop alone.
 *
 * What a door does with a forest depends on whether it HAS an insertion point,
 * not on the arm: at one (a caret, a drop inside a block's text) the forest is
 * SPLICED there (`planSplice`), and without one (block-selection mode, a drop
 * outside any text) it lands as blocks after the anchor row. So a `markdown`
 * decision does not mean "becomes new blocks" — `para⏎` at a caret splices into

 *
 * A file wins outright; a block-forest payload beats text; text claims the
 * gesture as markdown unless both halves of the inline rule hold. The inline
 * arm is "no newline", not "one parsed paragraph": text without a line in it
 * cannot carry structure, so the native insert is exactly right for it (and
 * keeps url-paste, token-paste, `text/html` marks and the clipboard-insert
 * guard working), while ANY text with a newline — a lone `para⏎` included —
 * goes to the forest, whose door splices it at the point. Whatever the parse
 * yields, the splice puts it at the point, so no parse can be mistaken for
 * structure it does not have.
 *
 * `inline` is the caller's answer to *"is there an insertion point a single line
 * can land in?"* — true for a caret-in-block paste and for a drop whose target
 * sits inside a block's editing host, false for the block-selection-mode
 * container paste (which deliberately holds no caret) and for a drop over the
 * page's non-editable area. Empty text with `inline: false` therefore yields
 * `markdown`: every call site already declines on an empty parsed forest, so
 * that is the single place emptiness is handled.

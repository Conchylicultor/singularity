/**
 * Replay host B — the STORED doc — and the one entry point that picks a host
 * (`research/2026-09-09-page-data-based-text-undo-entries-v2.md` §2.4).
 *
 * A data-based text undo entry can be replayed onto a block that has no
 * mounted editor (a merge target that scrolled away, a block restored by a
 * structural undo before its editor mounted). There is then no canonical doc
 * in process to splice, so the write goes through the server's own two
 * endpoints, exactly as the offscreen merge always has:
 *
 *  1. `doc-init` with the row's `data.text` as the proposed seed — first-writer-
 *     wins, so the response is the AUTHORITATIVE stored state (the surviving
 *     doc when one exists; the seed only for a never-opened block, where the
 *     row IS the truth);
 *  2. read that state's runs, ask the caller what the content should become
 *     RELATIVE to them, and splice headless (`$spliceRunsInto`, the same
 *     alignment host A uses) into a delta;
 *  3. `doc-update` merges the delta server-side; every live subscriber
 *     converges through the resource push.
 *
 * `runs` is a FUNCTION of the authoritative current runs for one reason: a
 * FORWARD write (the unmounted merge's append) must stay relative to what the
 * server holds, never to a row projection that may lag the doc by a second.
 * The un-append is then simply a splice back to the recorded `before`, whose
 * prefix alignment removes exactly the appended suffix — no positional cut.
 *
 * This is the one file of the pair that imports `fetchEndpoint`; host A
 * (`block-text-write.ts`) stays pure so the bun suite can load it.
 */

/**
 * A replay could not be written. `cause` is the transport failure — an
 * `EndpointError` for a server rejection, including the 404 a PURGED block
 * answers doc-init with (a merely deleted block is a trash and still answers).
 * `useUndoRedo` runs thunks as a floating promise, so this surfaces as an
 * unhandled rejection and the crash collector files it.

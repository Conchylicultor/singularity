/**
 * Narrow a predicted `delete` to `blockIds` — the ONE constructor for a
 * `{tag:"op"}` value that is not a fresh prediction, so the composite's
 * per-owner-page fan-out never spells the literal (and can never omit
 * `targets`). The effect is byte-identical to what {@link predictOp} builds for
 * this kind, so a fanned-out op is indistinguishable from one dispatched for
 * that page alone.
 *
 * `targets` is carried through WHOLE rather than narrowed. It is the union-space
 * set of the entire gesture, so a per-page op holds ids belonging to another
 * page — and the worst that can do is match another op in THIS page's pending
 * list that also names a foreign id. A spurious match only DEFERS a departure
 * (the ordering rule makes an op wait; it never drops one), so widening here
 * costs at most one extra pass, never an edit.

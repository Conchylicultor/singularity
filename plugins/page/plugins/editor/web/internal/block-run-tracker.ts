/**
 * The per-block **run tracker**: turns the stream of local transactions on a
 * block's canonical `Y.Doc` into DATA undo entries — one {@link BlockRunsEdit}
 * per typing run, carrying the block's runs before and after the run — instead
 * of pointers into a per-block Yjs undo manager's stack, which the deleted
 * pointer model relied on
 * (`research/2026-09-09-page-data-based-text-undo-entries-v2.md` §2.3). It is
 * owned by the block's `BlockDocOwner` (`collab-session.ts`), which hands it the
 * memoized doc read (`runsNow`) and its transport provider; it is a leaf on its
 * own so the bun suite can drive it on a bare `Y.Doc`.
 *
 * ## The three origins
 *
 * Exactly three transaction origins reach a canonical doc, and the tracker's
 * whole classification is stated over them — never learned:
 *
 * - the **transport provider** — a server apply or a seed. Not the user.
 * - {@link TEXT_REPLAY_ORIGIN} — an undo/redo replaying an entry
 *   (`block-text-write.ts`). Not the user either: recording it would put the
 *   replay itself on the stack.
 * - the **binding**, relayed verbatim by `binding-replica.ts` — every Lexical
 *   edit, typing and surgery alike. This IS the user.
 *
 * So `isLocalEdit(origin) = origin !== provider && origin !== TEXT_REPLAY_ORIGIN`.
 *
 * ## A run
 *
 * - `beforeTransaction`, local origin, no run open ⇒ OPEN one with
 *   `before = runsNow()`. A memo hit on the common path; on a miss the read
 *   hydrates a separate headless replica from `encodeStateAsUpdate`, which
 *   performs no transaction on the source doc, so there is no re-entrancy.
 *   A transaction that then integrates nothing (no `update` event) discards
 *   the run it opened — nothing happened, so nothing is pending.
 * - `update`, local origin ⇒ re-arm the idle timer ({@link TEXT_RUN_IDLE_MS}).
 * - `update`, NON-local origin, mid-run ⇒ ABORT the run and report
 *   `run-aborted`: an entry recorded across a remote apply would carry the
 *   remote text as if the user had typed it, and undoing it would destroy that
 *   text. One lost undo step at a genuinely concurrent moment, never a
 *   destructive entry. (An echo of this client's own flush integrates nothing
 *   and fires no `update`, so it cannot trip this.)
 * - {@link closeRun} — the idle timer, a pending-flush before an undo, or an
 *   {@link untracked} scope — reads `after = runsNow()` and emits the edit to
 *   the subscribers when it differs from `before`. Idempotent.
 *
 * ## `untracked(edit)`
 *
 * The suppression scope for a caller that records its OWN data entry around a
 * binding-origin surgery (a split's truncation, a merge's append, an inline
 * autoformat): it closes any open run first, then runs `edit` with every local
 * transaction ignored, so the surgery neither opens a run nor extends one —
 * otherwise each would double-record on top of the structural entry. Because
 * it wraps the real Yjs transaction, the transaction must land SYNCHRONOUSLY
 * inside the scope (`discrete: true` on the Lexical update).

 * The whole of a text undo entry — replaying it is bringing the block to

 *
 * `caretBefore` / `caretAfter` are the linear caret offsets at the run's
 * boundaries, so a replay can land the caret where the user was. The tracker
 * cannot read them — it observes the doc, not an editor — so it emits them
 * `undefined` and the component recorder (`collab-text-plugin.tsx`), which

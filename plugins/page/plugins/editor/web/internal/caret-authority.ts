//
// Before this module the editor only ever *requested* focus (`pendingFocusRef`)
// and waited for the browser to agree. A block created by Enter does not exist
// yet, so the caret landed only when the new editor's PASSIVE effect registered
// its handle — a separate React scheduler task — while keydowns arrive from the
// browser's higher-priority user-interaction source. Every keystroke in that gap
// was delivered to the ORIGIN's contenteditable, already truncated, caret at the
// cut point: typing "alpha" Enter "bravo" produced `["alphab", "ravo"]`. The gap
// is not bounded by anything; it just usually loses the race to human fingers.
//
// So the registry of `BlockFocusHandle`s lives HERE and is unreachable from the
// provider: there is no way to focus a block except `land()`, which means a
// future caller cannot reintroduce the gap. That is the enforcement — a
// type-level fact, not a lint rule.
//
// See `research/2026-07-31-page-caret-authority.md` and the CLAUDE.md section

// Document-level caret geometry for the block editor.
//
// Each block is its own Lexical editor, so caret movement ACROSS blocks can't
// rely on a single editor's line model. This module is the shared, low-level
// layer the coordinator uses:
//   - `readCaretContext` measures the caret in the SOURCE editor: its linear
//     offset, whether it sits at the structural start/end, whether it sits on
//     the first/last VISUAL line (so multi-line blocks only cross at their real
//     top/bottom), and its pixel column (so the column survives the crossing).
//   - `placeCaretAtColumn` / `placeCaretAtBoundary` place the caret in the
//     TARGET editor at that pixel column on the matching visual edge, or at the
//     block's very start/end (Left/Right crossing).
//
// Visual-line detection is font/padding-agnostic: it compares the caret rect to
// reference rects built at the contenteditable's content start/end, never to
// absolute padding. The DOM→Lexical placement uses `caretRangeFromPoint`
// (WebKit/Chrome) / `caretPositionFromPoint` (Firefox) and maps the hit DOM node
// to its Lexical node precisely (no reliance on async selectionchange).

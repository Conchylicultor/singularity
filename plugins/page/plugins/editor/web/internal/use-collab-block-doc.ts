/**
 * Per-block `{ doc, provider, undoManager }` registry + the `useCollabBlockDoc`
 * hook — THE single seam between the editor and the content-doc transport
 * (per-block CRDT plan, Stage 2). Everything transport- and undo-manager-shaped
 * lives behind this hook: a future delta-WS provider swaps in here and nothing
 * else in the editor changes. That includes "is this block's prose saved yet" —
 * the hook surfaces the provider's derived {@link CollabSaveState} rather than
 * handing the provider itself out, so the consumer reports to the sync-status
 * cloud without ever touching the transport.
 *
 * The registry is module-level and ref-counted per block id so React
 * strict-mode double-mounts and any second reader of the same block share ONE
 * `Y.Doc` (two docs for one block would fork the CRDT). Destruction is
 * deferred a macrotask: strict-mode releases and re-acquires synchronously
 * within one commit, and `CollaborationPlugin` does not re-call its
 * providerFactory on the simulated remount — an immediate destroy would pull
 * the doc out from under the binding it still holds.
 *
 * ## Undo (Stage 3b)
 *
 * Each entry owns a `Y.UndoManager` over the doc's content root, tracking ONLY
 * local-edit origins: origins are learned dynamically on `beforeTransaction` —
 * anything that is not the provider (server-applied states) and not an
 * `UndoManager` (undo/redo replays) is a local editing source (in practice
 * exactly the `@lexical/yjs` binding, which transacts with itself as origin).
 * Remote/echoed applies therefore never enter a block's undo history, and the
 * manager's own undo/redo transactions never re-capture.
 *
 * The manager does the COALESCING (its `captureTimeout` folds a typing run
 * into one stack item); every NEW item is surfaced to the mounted consumer via
 * `onUndoableEdit` so it can be recorded 1:1 onto the app's single document-
 * level undo stack. That 1:1 correspondence is what makes the generic
 * `um.undo()` thunk correct: entries referencing one block's manager are
 * recorded in item order, and the shared stack is LIFO, so when an entry is
 * popped all later entries for that block were popped first — the manager's
 * top item IS the entry's item. `captureBlockDocEdit` (split/merge) keeps the
 * correspondence by folding its item into the caller's combined entry instead
 * of surfacing it.
 *
 * `CollaborationPlugin`'s own forced per-block `UndoManager` stays inert: its
 * UNDO/REDO commands are swallowed (collab-text-plugin) and this manager's
 * replay transactions don't match its tracked origins.
 */

 * `Y.UndoManager` captureTimeout — the text-coalescing window. Matches the

 * observers (projection + undo capture) fire exactly as on the server path, so
 * the projection writes runs into the in-memory store and text edits still ride
 * the unified undo stack. THE seam for how in-memory content docs "sync": they
 * don't — hence a permanently idle {@link CollabBlockDoc.saveState}.

/**
 * Doc-level append for a block with NO mounted editor (the offscreen-merge
 * fallback, Stage 3a): when a Backspace-merge targets a block whose editor
 * isn't mounted (virtualized offscreen), we can't drive its Lexical instance —
 * so we edit its content doc directly, losslessly:
 *
 *  1. `doc-init` with a seed built from the block's current `data.text` —
 *     first-writer-wins, so the response is the authoritative stored state
 *     (the existing doc when one exists; our seed only for a never-opened
 *     block, where `data.text` IS the truth).
 *  2. Replay that state headless and append `runs` through the SAME Lexical
 *     walk the live editor uses (`editYDocState` + `$appendRuns` — marks +
 *     decorator tokens preserved), yielding an incremental update.
 *  3. `doc-update` merges it server-side; any live subscriber (including a
 *     registry entry that mounts meanwhile) converges via the resource push.
 *
 * Returns the JOIN offset (the content's plain length before the append) so
 * the merge's undo entry can reverse the append via
 * {@link truncateBlockDocFrom} (Stage 3b).
 *
 * No `rowConfirmed` gate here: the target of an offscreen merge is by
 * construction a long-existing block (it scrolled out of the viewport). If it
 * were somehow not yet server-real, doc-init 404s cleanly, this rejects
 * loudly, and the caller's structural delete never fires — both blocks intact.

/**
 * Doc-level truncation for a block with NO mounted editor — the inverse of
 * {@link appendRunsToBlockDoc}, used by the offscreen-merge UNDO thunk
 * (Stage 3b): delete the target doc's content from linear `offset` to the end,
 * losslessly, via the same three-step shape (authoritative state via doc-init,
 * headless Lexical edit, incremental doc-update). Position-based rather than
 * CRDT-relative — acceptable because the shared stack is LIFO, so any later
 * edits to the same block were undone (and flushed) before this runs.
 *
 * FRAGILITY: the cut is a position, not a CRDT-relative anchor, so it is safe
 * ONLY under single-client LIFO. A concurrent append PAST `offset` landing
 * between the merge and this undo would be silently deleted — a cross-client
 * lost write. Dormant today: this offscreen path runs only when the target
 * editor is UNMOUNTED, which needs virtualization the page editor does not do
 * (so single-client LIFO holds and nothing writes past `offset` here). The
 * trigger that would require a CRDT-relative rewrite is a virtualized +
 * multi-writer (my-devices + agents) target — see the residual-edge note.

 * A block's text as it stands NOW, for a decision about what the user sees —
 * "is the last line already empty?", "is this block blank, so a pasted file
 * replaces it?".
 *
 * The row's `data.text` is a ~1 s-debounced projection of the block's content
 * doc, so asking the row right after typing answers for the text as it was
 * before the typing run: a line the user just filled still reads empty, and a
 * click below the page lands the caret at its end instead of opening a fresh
 * line. The doc is the owner, so it is read whenever it can answer — a live
 * owner whose doc is AUTHORITATIVE. An owner still waiting on its subscription
 * holds an empty doc because nothing arrived, not because the block is empty,
 * so that case (and a block never opened here) falls back to the row.

// The library fact the whole mark-boundary design rests on, pinned as a test.
//
// The page editor models an inline-mark boundary as a caret position that DOES
// NOT EXIST in the document: the two sides of the seam are one address, so the
// caret's second component ("which side am I on") has to live in a side store
// (`web/internal/mark-depth.ts`). Design:
// `research/2026-08-06-page-inline-mark-boundary-caret.md`, and the arrival
// channel built on it: `research/2026-08-08-global-caret-crossing-channel.md`.
//
// ## It is LEXICAL that collapses the two sides, not Chromium
//
// `page/editor/CLAUDE.md` and the 2026-08-06 doc both attribute the collapse to
// the browser ("**Measured**: Chromium resolves a text/text seam to the END of
// the left run"). Same observable, wrong cause — and the difference matters,
// because a browser quirk could flip on the next Chromium release while a
// library invariant cannot flip without a version bump.
//
// The mechanism is `resolveSelectionPointOnBoundary` in `lexical@0.44.0`
// (`~/.bun/install/cache/lexical@0.44.0@@@1/Lexical.dev.mjs:7669-7677`). For a
// COLLAPSED point at `offset === 0` whose previous sibling is a `TextNode`, it
// does `point.set(prevSibling.__key, prevSibling.getTextContent().length,
// 'text')` — with no format check whatsoever. It is reached from
// `$normalizeSelectionPointsForBoundaries` (`:7701`) inside
// `$internalResolveSelectionPoints` (`:7743`), i.e. on EVERY DOM→model
// resolution. No browser is involved, which is why this test can run headless in
// jsdom and still be the real thing.
//
// The two tests below are the two halves of one statement:
//
//  1. Two adjacent `TextNode`s, the first carrying the `code` format bit. Hand
//     the resolver `(plainTextDOM, 0)` and it comes back `(codeLeaf, 2)` — the
//     right run's own start is not an address a caret can hold.
//     **If this ever fails, the mark-boundary design's central premise has
//     changed: `(rightLeaf, 0)` is now a real, holdable position, and
//     `web/internal/mark-depth.ts` (plus the arrival channel that feeds it) must
//     be revisited rather than patched.**
//
//  2. The same shape with a `LinkNode` — a real inline `ElementNode`, registered
//     in the page editor today — in place of the code-formatted run. The anchor
//     comes back `(plainLeaf, 0)` UNCHANGED, because the inline-`ElementNode`
//     branch of that same function is gated on `!isCollapsed` and therefore
//     never fires for a caret.
//
// Together they are the evidence for the design AND for why the recorded
// alternative — marks as inline `ElementNode`s, the way `link` already is — is
// the ONE door to a genuinely real boundary position. That alternative is costed
// and deliberately NOT taken (no pending-mark channel for elements, a hard CRDT
// cutover; see the 2026-08-08 doc, "The one door to a genuinely real position").
// Test 2 is what keeps that recorded reasoning honest: if the gate ever moved,
// the alternative's central claim would be false and the record would need
// correcting.
//
// The resolver used is the exported `$createRangeSelectionFromDom` (`:7778`).
// It forwards to `$internalCreateRangeSelection(null, domSelection, editor,
// null)`, whose `eventType` is therefore `undefined` — which is exactly the
// branch that takes the DOM selection (`:7803`) rather than cloning a previous
// model selection. So this exercises the same code path a real `selectionchange`
// does, with no synthetic event and no browser.

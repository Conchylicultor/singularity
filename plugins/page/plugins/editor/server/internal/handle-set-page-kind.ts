/**
 * Change what a page IS to the agents working on it — an ordinary page, an
 * agent-authored page, or an instructions page (global or not). The page
 * header's kind control, and the ONLY write that changes a page's kind after it
 * is born (`research/2026-09-15-page-agent-page-follow-ups.md` §1,
 * `research/2026-09-17-page-agent-instructions.md`).
 *
 * Any page may be changed, a top-level one included: it is the human's choice,
 * and no MCP tool exposes this op, so only the human makes it. The write is
 * {@link rekindPageData}'s — the stored data with the kind keys set and every
 * other key copied — so a change cannot carry a title or an icon along with it.
 *
 * Setting the kind the page already has is a no-op: no write, no event, the row
 * returned as it is. So a double click, or two tabs clicking at once, lands one
 * change, not a change and a change back.
 *
 * What a change leaves alone: the page's content, its authorship rows (which
 * conversations wrote into it — they stop showing while the page is not an
 * agent page, and show again if it becomes one), and every version in its
 * history (a restore keeps the page's CURRENT kind; see `restorePageContent`).
 *
 * Exported beside the endpoint so a DB-backed suite drives it on a throwaway
 * database, as `applyPageBlockPatch` is.

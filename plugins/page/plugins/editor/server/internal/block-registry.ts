   * One inline decorator token family — the server twin of the web-only

   *
   * **`pattern`** is the LOCATOR: how to find one of this family's tokens in a
   * line, so it can be built, serialized and re-materialized. **`node`** is the
   * spec object from the family's own `core/` — the very object the browser's
   * class extends via `.decorated({…})`, never a class of its own. Because it is
   * one object rather than two literals that agree today, the two runtimes
   * cannot name a different type string, different field names or a different
   * token format: that is the argument the pattern half already made, extended
   * to the node half. Which is also why there is no parity check here.
   *
   * **`markdownSpan`** is a SEPARATE question from `pattern`, and required for
   * exactly that reason: it says whether those bytes must be masked from the
   * marks-aware inline scan (see {@link MarkdownSpan}, which states the whole
   * argument). One regex can answer both questions, so the two used to be one
   * field — and every registered token therefore got masking whether it needed
   * it or not, which silently strips the marks a person put on the span. A bare
   * id inside backticks came back as an unmarked run, so documentation turned
   * into a live widget. Keep them apart.
   *
   * `node` is OPTIONAL: a pure text token with no decorator is legitimate, and
   * every contribution was pattern-only before the node half existed. A family
   * that contributes none keeps being refused by
   * `markdown-apply`'s `readStateRuns` — the refusal narrows to the types that
   * still have no server node, it does not soften.
   *
   * `pattern` is REQUIRED even alongside a `node`, and that is the shape rather
   * than an accident of history: without it `blockTextServerExtensions` can mint
   * no extension for the family, so `tokenOf` would fall through to the node's
   * own `getTextContent()` — `""` for every `textContent: "empty"` family — and
   * silently delete the token it just hydrated. The lossy shape is unspellable.

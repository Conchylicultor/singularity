/**
 * Give a page a new title, server-side — the write behind an agent renaming its
 * page by editing the `# Title` line in `edit_page`
 * (`research/2026-09-15-page-agent-page-follow-ups.md` §3). A human renames
 * through the header's own `PATCH`; this is for a caller with no live page row
 * to spread.
 *
 * It writes the page ROW's data — `{ ...stored, title }`, through
 * {@link rewriteBlockData} like every other data edit — and never the page's
 * content, so the `# Title` banner stays a line the reader adds on top rather
 * than a block. Carrying the stored data through is what keeps the author (and
 * the icon and the cover) as they are: the title is the one key it names.
 *
 * `requireAuthor` is a precondition judged UNDER the page's lock: the page must
 * still be authored by that party when the title is written, or the call is a
 * 409 and writes nothing. `edit_page` passes `"agent"` — it decided the edit
 * was a rename because the page was an agent's, and a human may flip the page to
 * their own between that decision and this write. Checking only in the tool
 * would leave that race open. A page with no author marker is the human's.
 *
 * An unchanged title writes nothing and announces nothing, and returns the row.

 * FK cascades never fire, so descendants, `page_block_docs`, side-tables, and

 * is trashed exactly like a page-containing one, under one `page-blocks` entry
 * instead of a `pages` one. The whole cascade set is loaded and written under
 * the page locks of every page it spans (a sub-page's content lives in its OWN
 * `page_id` partition), so a delete can no longer interleave with an op on any
 * page it touches.
 *
 * Entry partition — ONE gesture, ONE undo:
 *  - each `type="page"` ROOT gets its own independently-restorable `pages` entry
 *    (a bulk delete of two sub-pages ⇒ two entries, the Pages Trash lists both);
 *  - every other row of the operation (non-page roots and their subtrees, and
 *    any row not under a page root) folds into ONE anchor entry: the first page
 *    entry when there is one, else a fresh entry anchored on the first
 *    requested root — in the `pages` source when the set contains a page
 *    anywhere (a sub-page nested under a deleted toggle must stay findable in
 *    the Pages Trash, labelled by that page's title), in the `page-blocks`
 *    source otherwise (labelled by the root's first line).
 *
 * Only LIVE rows are loaded, so an entry is never minted over nothing (an
 * already-trashed nested page keeps its own entry's ownership) — the ledger
 * invariant "an entry exists ⇔ at least one row carries its id".
 *
 * The minted entries are RETURNED (creation order, page roots first): they are

 * over-restores an independently-trashed nested page. The ledger row is deleted
 * in the SAME transaction as the un-flag, which is the restore half of the
 * ledger invariant "an entry exists ⇔ at least one row carries its id" (the
 * trash half is `trashDeletedRows` / `deleteBlocksSubtree`). The trash
 * endpoint's own delete-after-action then finds nothing, which is fine — a
 * source consuming its entry inside `restore` is sanctioned by the primitive.
 *
 * A restored ROOT keeps its stored row; only what the world changed while it
 * was trashed is repaired:
 *  - its `(parent_id, rank)` slot was taken by a live sibling → it is re-ranked
 *    to sit right AFTER that occupant (`rankAdjacentTo`), so it comes back
 *    where it was rather than at the end of the list;
 *  - its parent is gone (purged, or still trashed) → it is reparented to the
 *    nearest place it stays REACHABLE: a `type="page"` root becomes a root page
 *    at the workspace root; any other root lands at the END of its own page's
 *    top level (`parent_id = page_id`, `page_id` kept), so it is still in the
 *    forest every `liveBlocks WHERE page_id = …` read returns and its own
 *    children — which keep their `page_id` — still hang off a row that page
 *    contains. Sending a paragraph to the workspace root would strand it as a
 *    page-less content row no read can reach, with its children showing in the
 *    page under a parent that is not in it.
 * Restore therefore never fails on a slot collision. It DOES fail, loudly, when
 * a non-page root has no live page to land in (its page was purged, or is
 * itself still trashed): restoring a live row under a trashed page would
 * reintroduce exactly the live-under-trashed state the delete chokepoint
 * closes, and the `OnRestore` hooks would reindex it for search under a page
 * that does not exist to the user. Restore the page first.
 *
 * The `OnRestore` hooks run after commit over the restored rows. Idempotent: an
 * entry whose rows are already live restores nothing and is consumed anyway.

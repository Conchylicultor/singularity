/**
 * Generic minimal-change patch applier (the undo/redo inverse path). Creates the
 * given full rows, applies each update's NAMED fields, and deletes the given
 * ids, all in one locked transaction. Unlike `handleApplyBlockOp` it runs no
 * reducer — the caller has already computed the exact changes (a forward/reverse
 * {@link BlockPatch} derived from a before/after diff), so this is an
 * authoritative row-level writer onto the CURRENT state.
 *
 * Two invariants make it safe to be blind:
 *  - **An update writes only the columns it names.** A writer that owns one
 *    field cannot restate — and therefore cannot clobber — a field a concurrent
 *    writer owns. The `data.text` projection says `data` and nothing else, so it
 *    can no longer push a stale `type` over a conversion the user just made.
 *  - **An update never creates.** A patch whose target row is gone is a skip, by
 *    definition — which is what keeps a debounced projection flush racing a
 *    history restore from resurrecting a deleted block. Only `creates` may bring
 *    a row into existence (or back: an id matching a soft-deleted row restores).
 *
 * Trash symmetry (zero client changes):
 *  - **Un-trash-on-create.** Every delete is a trash, so a create whose id
 *    matches ANY trashed row — a page shell or a content row — restores that
 *    row's WHOLE ledger entry through `restoreEntryById` BEFORE the write
 *    transaction opens: the entry's rows come back with their stored columns
 *    and their surviving content docs, the entry is consumed, and the create is
 *    then excluded from every write bucket (its row is `stored` now, and the
 *    patch's copy must not overwrite what the restore just repaired — a
 *    re-ranked root, a reparented one). Entries are deduped, so an undo of a
 *    bulk delete restores its one entry once. Cmd+Z after any delete thereby
 *    restores the exact rows and docs.
 *  - **Re-trash-on-redo.** A page-free `deleteIds` is trashed inline by the
 *    writer under a fresh `page-blocks` entry; one containing a `type="page"`
 *    root routes back through the chokepoint (a fresh `pages` entry).
 *
 * Exported (not merely the endpoint's body) because it is THE sanctioned forest
 * write: `page-editor/no-adhoc-forest-write` forbids any other plugin touching
 * `_blocks`, so a server-side writer that computes its own `BlockPatch` — today
 * `page/markdown-apply`, which diffs an incoming markdown document against the
 * stored forest — routes through this one path rather than growing a second.

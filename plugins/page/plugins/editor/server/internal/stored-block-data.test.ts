/**
 * The `page_blocks.data` column's decoder, exercised on the REAL column rather
 * than a stand-in — `_blocks.data` itself, so what is pinned here is what ships.
 *
 * This is the one branded jsonb column in the repo, and the brand is the point:
 * `parseBlockData` is the only write-side mint, so a write that skipped
 * validation is a compile error. What the DECODER can and cannot claim is what
 * this suite pins, because both halves are easy to get wrong in opposite
 * directions:
 *
 *  - it must NOT be a `z.object` — the per-type schemas belong to ~35 block-type
 *    plugins and a decoder cannot know which one applies, so an object schema
 *    would strip every key it has not heard of, i.e. all of them;
 *  - it must still be a real check — a non-object row is a loud failure naming
 *    `page_blocks.data`, not a value typed code goes on to read fields off.

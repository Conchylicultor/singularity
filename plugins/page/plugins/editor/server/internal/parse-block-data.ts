 * its AUTHOR (409). The brand has one other minter, {@link rekindPageData}, which
 * changes the kind and nothing else.
 *
 * `global` on an instructions page is deliberately NOT part of that refusal: it
 * selects no spelling and moves no author, and it is the same plain data field
 * the inline `<instructions>` card flips from its menu. The header control writes
 * it through `setPageKind` all the same, beside the kind it belongs to.
 *
 * The one row whose author lives in its data today is a page: `data.author ===
 * "agent"` makes it an agent-authored page, whose whole content an agent may
 * write (`research/2026-09-11-page-agent-pages.md`). That marker is the page's
 * KIND, chosen when the page is born and changed afterwards only by
 * `rekindPageData` — the `setPageKind` op behind the page header's kind control
 * (`research/2026-09-15-page-agent-page-follow-ups.md`). Every page-data writer
 * spreads `{...pageData(page), title}` and so carries it through; one that did
 * not — a stale client, a hand-written PATCH, a history snapshot — would
 * silently hand a human's page to an agent's pen, or take an agent's page away
 * from it. Neither is a data edit, so neither is expressible as one: a data edit
 * cannot carry an author change, and an author change carries no data edit.
 *
 * Generic, and it names no field: the comparisons are `markdownTagNameOf` and
 * `blockAuthorOf` over the handle, before and after, so a future data-decided
 * kind or author is covered by construction.
 *
 * A TYPE change is not judged here: a type's author is a different question
 * (`agent-note` → `context` is a retype, and every type transition into or out of
 * `page` is refused or special-cased at the handlers), and turn-into-page — the
 * one sanctioned way INTO a page, the only place a page is born agent-authored
 * in place — mints through here with a type change for exactly that reason.

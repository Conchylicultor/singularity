/**
 * Every LIVE page row of the given sidebar groups (all of them when `pageIds`
 * is absent), each with its rank path — the input the `doc_rank` reconcile
 * orders a group by.
 *
 * Two relations in ONE query, kept strictly apart:
 *
 * - **Membership** is the plain select of live `type="page"` rows, and must
 *   NEVER become a function of the traversal. A page whose ancestor chain
 *   cannot resolve still gets a row (with `path: null`): otherwise it would
 *   never be given a `doc_rank` and would leak a NULL into the sidebar.
 * - **Order** is an **upward** recursive CTE from those rows: only pages plus
 *   their ancestor chains (~pages × depth), never the whole forest, LEFT-joined
 *   onto the membership. drizzle cannot emit recursive CTEs, so this is raw
 *   `sql`, mirroring the precedent in `page-id.ts` (`recomputePageIdSubtree`)
 *   and `collect-subtree.ts`.
 *
 * Partition-scoped (`pageIds`), the CTE is seeded only by those groups' pages —
 * an indexed `page_id` lookup — which is what keeps the per-write reconcile
 * cheap: a structural op in a page with no sub-pages returns no row.
 *
 * The walk stops exactly at the nearest page ancestor (`cursor = page_id`), so
 * `path` runs from a direct child of the parent page down to the page row.
 * Edge cases, all correct: a root page (`page_id` and `parent_id` both null)
 * terminates at the base with `path = [rank]`; a page whose parent IS a page has
 * `cursor = page_id` at the base, likewise terminal; a page under a root-level
 * content block walks to `parent_id IS NULL` and lands in the `null` group with
 * a content-rank prefix.
 *
 * **Correctness.** Within one `pageId` group, comparing paths element-wise is
 * DFS pre-order. No path is a proper prefix of another: if `path(X)` prefixed
 * `path(Y)`, then `Y` descends *through* `X`, making `X` a page ancestor of `Y`
 * — so `pageId(Y) = X ≠ pageId(X)`, contradicting same-group. Paths therefore
 * diverge at some index where both elements are ranks of live siblings under a
 * common parent, distinct by `page_blocks_parent_rank_live_uq` /
 * `page_blocks_root_rank_live_uq`. Total order, no ties.
 *
 * Returns the rows ONLY — **no ordering decision happens in SQL**, deliberately.
 * `rank_text` is a `TEXT COLLATE "C"` domain (byte order = rank order), but a
 * recursive CTE's column-type resolution can flatten the domain back to plain
 * `text`, silently reverting to locale collation — where `'a' < 'B'` while JS
 * `Rank.compare` says `'B' < 'a'`. The caller sorts in JS with
 * {@link compareDocOrder}; do not "optimize" the sort back into this query.

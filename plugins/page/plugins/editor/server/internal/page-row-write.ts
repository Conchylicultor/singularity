/**
 * Rewrite one PAGE row's `data`, with the read that decides the write taken
 * under the lock of the forest the row lives in — the shared body of the two
 * page-level writes that are not the header's own `PATCH`: the kind control
 * (`setPageKind`) and an agent's rename (`renamePage`).
 *
 * The shape is `handle-update-block.ts`'s, for its reasons:
 *
 * - **The scope is read before the lock, and everything else after.** A page
 *   row's `page_id` is the page it is DISPLAYED in (its parent's; `null` for a
 *   top-level page), so that is the forest to lock — the same one the header's
 *   title edit locks. The unlocked read names the lock and nothing more.
 * - **`decide` sees the row as it is under the lock.** A concurrent delete is
 *   the same 404 an unknown id gets (a trashed row is not addressable), and a
 *   judgement about the row — "is this still an agent page?" — is made against
 *   the one no concurrent write can change before this one commits. A check
 *   made before the lock would leave exactly that race.
 * - **`decide` returns the new data, or `null` for "nothing to write".** A
 *   no-op writes nothing and announces nothing, so setting what is already set
 *   costs no event and no push. It may also throw, which rolls back and writes
 *   nothing.
 * - **The announcement runs after commit.** `notifyBlockChange` emits for the
 *   page's own id and for the page it sits in — which is what refreshes the
 *   parent's row and the sidebar.
 *
 * Only a page: any other row is a 400, before the lock and again under it (a
 * conversion can race the first read).

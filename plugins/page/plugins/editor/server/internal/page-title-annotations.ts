/**
 * The `title` of every HUMAN sub-page among `rows` — the value of the annotated
 * `title` attribute on `<page id="…" title="…"/>`, this plugin's own
 * `Editor.BlockAnnotation` contribution.
 *
 * An annotation rather than a field the `<page>` spelling reads from `data`,
 * because `<page>` is ALSO how a link-to-page block writes itself, and that
 * block's title lives on another row: `page-link` claims the tag on parse, so a
 * `title` there has to be read-only and discarded, which is what `annotated`
 * means. `page-link/server` answers for the link rows; this answers for the
 * shells, whose title is simply their own.
 *
 * Every page written under another spelling is skipped — an agent-authored
 * `<agent-page>`, an `<instructions-page>`: those spellings emit `title` from
 * `data` themselves and do not reserve the name, so supplying it here too would
 * be a loud serialize error, not a duplicate. The test is "is this row written
 * as the primary `<page>`", the serializer's own selection, so a future page
 * kind needs no edit here; the throw keeps the skip honest.
 *
 * No query: the answer is in the rows the read already holds.

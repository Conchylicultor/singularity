/**
 * Real-DB suite for the structural-write chokepoint: `withPageForest` +
 * `forest-writer`. Headless — drives the db-parametrized writers against a
 * throwaway Postgres (db-test-fixture) with the REAL migration chain, so the
 * advisory locks, the `page_blocks` self-FK cascades and the partial unique
 * indexes are exactly what production applies.
 *
 * Both defects this exists to pin are TIMING-dependent in the wild (a human
 * pausing between two structural keystrokes hid them for months), so every test
 * here drives the interleaving explicitly rather than hoping for it. That needs
 * two INDEPENDENT connections — the fixture's own pool is `max: 1`, so two
 * concurrent transactions on it would serialize in the pool and prove nothing —
 * hence the two extra single-connection handles opened below.
 *
 * Run: `bun test plugins/page/plugins/editor/server/internal/page-forest.test.ts`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

/**
 * Two ops remove a block AND move its children out of it in the same write:
 * `unwrap` promotes a container's children into its slot, and a merge adopts the
 * merged block's children under the target. A trash flags exactly the ids it is
 * handed, so the writer closes the delete set under descendants itself — and it
 * must close it over the parentage this write LEAVES, not the parentage it read.
 * Closed over the pre-write forest, the re-homed children still count as the
 * removed block's descendants and are trashed right after their own update: the
 * client keeps them, the op never confirms, and a reload shows them gone.
 * research/2026-09-11-page-history-restore-preserves-block-identity.md §3.

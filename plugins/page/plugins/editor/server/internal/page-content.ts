 *
 * **Blocks are matched by id.** Nothing the user can see is hard-deleted:
 *  - a block in both the page and the version KEEPS its id, its `created_at`
 *    and its content doc; the doc is edited to the version's text, never
 *    replaced, so an open editor stays mounted and only sees a CRDT merge;
 *  - a block deleted since the version comes back as ITSELF (its trash entry is
 *    restored), with its surviving doc byte-exact;
 *  - a block created since the version is TRASHED, under one `page-blocks`
 *    entry, so restoring the "Before restore" version brings it back the same
 *    way.
 *
 * **Three phases**, the two-channel order every server-side content writer
 * follows (structure, then docs, then the text projection):
 *
 *  0. The page must be live — a missing or trashed page is a 404.
 *  1. **Revive**, before the lock (the patch handler's un-trash prelude does
 *     the same): each `page-blocks` entry holding a version block trashed from
 *     this page is restored whole. A row the entry holds that the version does
 *     not is trashed again by phase 2, under the restore's own entry.
 *  2. **Structure**, under the page lock: compute the target forest from the
 *     version and what is live now ({@link planRestoreTarget}), then write it
 *     with the op handler's own shape, {@link writeForestTarget}. The page row's
 *     own `data` (title, icon, cover) is set from `snapshot.page`.
 *  3. **Text**: `io.writeTexts` edits every text-bearing surviving block's doc
 *     to the version's runs, then projects `data.text`. Required rather than
 *     returned for the caller to apply: forgetting it would restore structure
 *     but not text, silently, and a required parameter makes that a tsc error.
 *
 * **Sub-pages are never touched.** A restore never creates, revives, deletes or
 * renames a sub-page. A live sub-page's row may only MOVE: back to its version
 * position when it has one, else it stays where it is, else it goes to the end
 * of the page's top level. Its `data` (title, icon) is always its current row's.
 *
 * **Re-running converges.** Every phase is a function of the version and the
 * current state, so a restore interrupted after phase 2 (a text-phase failure)
 * finishes when run again. A second run over a page the first run completed
 * writes no structure and mints no trash entry — except for fresh-id COPIES
 * (below), which a second run re-mints, trashing the first run's copies.
 *
 * `executor` is the global handle in production and a throwaway DB in tests;
 * it is not a transaction — each phase opens its own.

 * come from the version. A survivor's `data` is the version's too, except its
 * TEXT: when both carry `text`, the current one is kept, because the structural
 * write never changes a projection — the text phase edits the doc and projects
 * it. A block that turned from void back into text-bearing carries the

 * gets a text edit. A re-inserted or copied row carries the version's text as
 * its seed and gets no edit: it has no doc to edit.

 * keep their CURRENT `data`: writing the version's back would rename a live
 * sub-page. Only their place can change:
 *  1. a shell in the version goes to its version position (its parent is in
 *     the target, or the walk would not have reached it);
 *  2. else it keeps its current place, if that parent is in the target (or is
 *     the page) and no target row claims the same `(parent, rank)`;
 *  3. else it goes to the page's top level, above every target rank there.
 * A version shell that is not live here is dropped: a restore never mints a
 * sub-page.
 *
 * Every other live row of the page is left out of the target — the write
 * trashes it.
 *
 * The target's `(parent, rank)` pairs are unique: content pairs come from one
 * valid version, and rules 2 and 3 only ever take a free pair.

/**
 * THE only module in the repo that may name `_blocks` in a MUTATION position.
 *
 * Every export takes a {@link PageForestTx} — a transaction proven to hold the
 * write lock on the pages it touches — as a required parameter, so an unlocked
 * forest write is a tsc error rather than a convention. The direct way around
 * that (importing `_blocks` and writing it by hand somewhere else) is closed by
 * the `page-editor/no-adhoc-forest-write` lint rule, which exempts this file
 * alone. Two halves of one guardrail; neither is sufficient.
 *
 * There are exactly TWO write shapes, and keeping them distinct is deliberate:
 *
 *  - {@link writeForestTarget} — the op handler's whole write. Reconcile
 *    before→after, trash the AUTHORITATIVE delete set, persist the rest.
 *  - {@link writeBlockPatch} — the patch handler's whole write. Trash,
 *    rank-park, then the FIELD-SCOPED columns each update names. It must stay
 *    field-scoped: a "hand me the new forest" contract would regress
 *    `BlockPatch` back into whole-row writes, the exact thing
 *    `research/2026-07-28-page-block-write-ownership.md` removed.
 *
 * **No hard delete of live content.** Neither write shape ever `DELETE`s a row
 * the user can see: every delete is a trash — the rows are flagged under ONE
 * ledger entry per operation (`trashDeletedRows`), and their content docs, ext
 * side-tables and version history survive until purge. The real `DELETE`
 * ({@link deleteBlockRoots}) is reachable from purge alone. History restore
 * used to be the other caller (it wiped a page's content and re-inserted it
 * with fresh ids); it now writes through {@link writeForestTarget} like the op
 * handler, so it trashes too.
 * `research/2026-09-09-page-data-based-text-undo-entries-v2.md` §3,

 * stored there now and the final ranks this batch is about to write there. The
 * caller then runs its normal per-row UPDATE with the final `(parentId, rank)`
 * (phase 2), in any order.
 *
 * It permutes the non-deferrable `(parent_id, rank)` partial unique index, so it
 * is never legal unlocked — hence the {@link PageForestTx}.
 *
 * ## Why a scratch value is required
 *
 * `page_blocks` carries a per-tuple `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (parent_id,
 * rank)` index. It is **not** `DEFERRABLE` (drizzle cannot emit that), so every
 * single-row UPDATE is checked immediately. A batch that permutes ranks among
 * siblings therefore transiently duplicates a pair mid-loop:
 *
 * - the `bulkMove` op mints its `nBetween` window *excluding* the moving
 *   ids, so a computed key can equal a rank a still-unmoved sibling holds.
 *   (Under parent P with siblings `B="a1"`, `C="a2"`, `D="a3"`, moving `{B,D}`
 *   after `C`: the window `("a2", null)` yields `["a3","a4"]`, and `B → "a3"`
 *   lands while `D` still holds `"a3"`.)
 * - `handlePatchBlocks` writes client-computed rows verbatim; undoing a swap
 *   re-assigns two rows to each other's ranks.
 *
 * Re-ordering the UPDATEs cannot save either case: a 2-cycle (a plain swap) has
 * no safe order. Only a scratch value does.
 *
 * ## Why phase 2 is then unconditionally safe
 *
 * Let `floor(p) = max(every rank currently stored under p, every final rank the
 * batch writes under p)`, over both `placements` and `incoming`. Park keys under
 * `p` are `nBetween(floor(p), null, n)` — mutually distinct and each strictly
 * greater than `floor(p)`.
 *
 * - *Phase 1 is safe*: a park key exceeds every rank currently under `p`, and
 *   the keys are distinct, so no two parked rows meet.
 * - *Phase 2 is safe*: when a row is written to its final `(p, r)`, the only
 *   rows under `p` are (a) rows the batch never touched, whose ranks are
 *   `≤ floor(p)` but cannot equal `r` unless the caller handed two rows the
 *   same pair, and (b) still-parked rows, whose keys are `> floor(p) ≥ r`.
 *   Order within phase 2 is therefore irrelevant.
 *
 * Any collision that survives means the caller computed two identical final
 * pairs — a genuine bug, and the index fires loudly rather than silently
 * dropping an ordering.
 *
 * ## Why parking happens under the CURRENT parent
 *
 * Parking never rewrites `parent_id`. That keeps phase 1 free of foreign-key
 * order dependencies: a patch may reparent an existing row under a row the same
 * batch has not INSERTed yet, and parking it into that parent up front would
 * violate the self-FK. Vacating the row's old pair is all phase 1 owes phase 2,
 * and a pure rank bump does exactly that.
 *
 * Rows whose `(parentId, rank)` is unchanged need no parking — see
 * {@link pairChanged}; an UPDATE writing a row's own current pair is invisible
 * to the index.

/**
 * What a forest write removed from the page's live content.
 *
 * Every removal is a TRASH, and the only question is WHERE it happens:
 *
 *  - a page-free delete set is trashed INLINE, in this write's own transaction
 *    (`trashDeletedRows`): one ledger entry in the `page-blocks` source, whose
 *    id is `trashedEntryId`. The hot path stays one transaction.
 *  - a delete set containing a `type="page"` row is DEFERRED: a page's own
 *    content lives in its own `page_id` partition under its own lock, which
 *    this transaction does not hold, so the caller routes `deleteRootIds`
 *    through `deleteBlocksSubtree` (which takes every page lock it needs) AFTER
 *    the transaction. `deferredToChokepoint` is a real branch, not a flag to
 *    ignore — a page silently cascading here is the 2026-07-10 data-loss bug.
 *
 * Two rules hold for both, and both follow from the trash no longer being a
 * `DELETE` (whose FK cascade ran after the moves, so it got them for free):
 *
 *  - **The set is closed over the forest AS WRITTEN** ({@link deleteClosureOf}):
 *    a row this same write re-homes out of a removed block (an `unwrap`'s
 *    promoted children, a merge's adopted ones, the redo of either) is not that
 *    block's descendant any more, so it is never trashed. A surviving row whose
 *    as-written parent chain still reaches a removed row — an orphan a buggy
 *    reducer or patch left behind — IS trashed: the closure stays the guarantee
 *    that no live row hangs off a trashed one.
 *  - **The inline trash runs before anything is placed**: before `parkRanks`,
 *    the inserts and the updates. The live unique indexes are partial on
 *    `deleted_at IS NULL`, so a trashed row vacates its `(parent_id, rank)`
 *    slot, and a survivor or insert may land exactly where a row this write
 *    removes sat. The deferred branch cannot: its rows stay live until the
 *    chokepoint runs after commit, so a placement onto a slot one of them holds
 *    is still a unique violation there. No caller produces that shape today.

 * promotion), which once was what kept them off the rank of a row that stayed
 * live until the end of the write; trashing first and parking make the write
 * shape correct for every arm, present and future, instead of asking each one
 * to re-derive the collision argument. `pairChanged` filters parking to rows
 * that really move, so the ops that permute nothing (a split, a text patch) pay

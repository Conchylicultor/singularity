/**
 * Set (or clear, with `null`) a page's emoji icon, server-side — for a caller
 * with no live page row to spread (the header writes through its own `PATCH`).
 * Built on {@link rewritePageRow}, so the read that decides the write is taken
 * under the page forest's lock, the stored data rides through verbatim (title,
 * cover, kind), and the change is announced (`blocksChanged`) after commit.
 *
 * `onlyIfUnset`: write only when the page has no icon under the lock — the
 * guard for an automatic writer that must never overwrite an icon the user
 * picked while it was working. Judged under the lock, so a concurrent pick
 * cannot slip between the check and the write.
 *
 * Setting the icon the page already has (or skipping under `onlyIfUnset`)
 * writes nothing and announces nothing; either way the current row is returned.
 *
 * `executor` must be able to OPEN a transaction (see {@link ForestExecutor}): the
 * forest lock is this call's own transaction, never a caller's.

// A heading block IS a heading, verified in a real browser.
// See research/2026-08-16-page-block-aria-semantics.md and the editor's
// CLAUDE.md, *A block type declares its ARIA identity*.
//
// What is being defended:
//
//  1. Heading-jump works. A page's `heading-1/2/3` blocks render as ordinary
//     editable lines; a block type declares `semantics` and the shared skeleton
//     turns it into `role="heading"` + `aria-level` on its leaf cell. Three
//     typed headings must therefore be three headings, at their own levels, each
//     NAMED by its own line — and the plain paragraph beside them must be none.
//  2. The role appears without costing the caret. Converting a paragraph into a
//     heading is a re-style of a FIXED element skeleton, never a remount, so the
//     user keeps typing where they were. That is the whole reason the role is an
//     attribute on the leaf cell rather than a real `<h2>` element.
//  3. An empty focused heading is not named by its placeholder. The placeholder
//     renders INSIDE the leaf cell, so without `aria-hidden` an empty H1 would
//     announce as "Heading 1" — named by decoration.
//
// Why a real browser, and not `web/__tests__/block-semantics.test.tsx` alone:
// that test renders the skeleton with a stand-in for the Lexical leaf, so it can
// state what the skeleton does with a declared role but nothing about what
// Lexical's real DOM does to the accessible name, nor about the caret surviving
// a live conversion. Both are only observable here — and the accessible NAME
// specifically, because it is computed by the browser over the real
// `heading` > `textbox` nesting, is the part with no jsdom equivalent.
//

   * read off the row's `text` — a projection of the content doc that lags it by

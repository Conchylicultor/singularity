// Caret-in-block clipboard verification for the pages block editor, in a real
// browser.
//
// The rule under test (`web/components/block-forest-copy-plugin.tsx`):
//
//   > With NOTHING selected, the caret's own block IS the selection.
//
// so Cmd+C on a bare caret copies the whole block, Cmd+V lands it after that
// block (the existing `BlockForestPastePlugin`), and the pair is a two-keystroke
// duplicate. A real text range is untouched — the browser's own copy/paste still
// runs, inline, marks and all.
//
// Phases:
//   A. collapsed caret + Cmd+C writes the BLOCK to the clipboard (text/plain is
//      its markdown), where the native copy would have written nothing
//   B. Cmd+V after it duplicates the block in place
//   C. the subtree travels: copying a parent carries its indented child
//   D. a real text selection is STILL the browser's own text copy (the half that
//      must not regress) — asserted on the clipboard FLAVORS, which is where the
//      two paths visibly differ: the browser writes text/html beside the text,
//      this plugin writes text/plain alone
//   E. Cmd+X on a bare caret cuts the whole block
//   F. a ONE-STEP selection gesture (Shift+Home) followed IMMEDIATELY by Cmd+C
//      is still the browser's copy, and pastes back INLINE. The gap this closes:
//      Lexical's model selection is synced from the DOM on `selectionchange`, a
//      task later than the keystroke, so for that one task `$getSelection()`
//      still reports the pre-gesture COLLAPSED caret — and the plugin claimed
//      the copy, so the selected text pasted as a new block below instead of
//      landing inline (and Cmd+X would have deleted the block). The no-settle
//      timing IS the test: a settle re-tests phase D.

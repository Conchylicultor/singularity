/**
 * Reading and WALKING TO the caret's linear offset inside a block.
 *
 * **Presses are not offsets in this editor.** A mark boundary is a caret
 * position (the virtual delimiter — see the editor's CLAUDE.md), so one press at
 * a seam ARMS the pending mark and moves nothing: `keystroke-intent.ts` tries
 * `markStepFor` before the ordinary move, and `$markStep` records the pending
 * format without touching an offset. A fixture that counts nine ArrowRights to
 * land at offset 9 therefore lands at 8 the day a seam appears in its text, and
 * the failure surfaces one character downstream — as a content diff in whatever
 * the fixture did next, never at the walk that caused it.
 *
 * `pressUntilOffset` is what prevents that: it walks to a MEASURED offset and
 * throws when it cannot reach it. Counting presses is the bug this module
 * exists to make unwritable.
 *
 * **There are deliberately TWO walkers, and they must not be merged.**
 *
 * - `pressUntilOffset` is PLACEMENT. It gets a fixture to a position so the
 *   real assertions can run; arriving is a precondition, so failing to arrive
 *   THROWS.
 * - `pressUntilLinear` is MEASUREMENT. The press COUNT is itself the assertion
 *   (`mark-boundary-verify.ts` phase 6 asks how many presses a seam costs), so
 *   it checks BEFORE pressing — stopping the moment it reads the target, never
 *   spending the absorbed press the spec is about to measure — and returns `-1`
 *   on exhaustion, a value its callers assert on rather than a swallowed
 *   failure.
 *
 * `caretLinear` is lifted verbatim from `mark-boundary-verify.ts`, whose own
 * doc-comment already noted `backspace-indent-verify.ts` holding the same read —
 * the third copy, which is exactly where the cmd-b work drew the line when it
 * lifted `settledRuns` into `support/runs.ts`.

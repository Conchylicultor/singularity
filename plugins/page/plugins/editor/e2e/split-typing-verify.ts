// Typing straight through an Enter loses nothing, verified in a real browser.
// See research/2026-07-31-page-caret-authority.md
//
// The defect: `focusNew` could not focus the block it had just minted — it does
// not exist yet — so it armed `pendingFocusRef`, and the caret only landed when
// the new `BlockTextEditor` mounted and its PASSIVE effect registered a focus
// handle. React flushes passive effects in a separate scheduler task, while
// keydown arrives from the browser's higher-priority user-interaction task
// source, so a keystroke in that gap was structurally favoured to win — and it
// was delivered to the ORIGIN's contenteditable, already truncated with the
// caret at the cut point. Each word's FIRST character stayed behind:
//
//   typed:  "alpha" Enter "bravo" Enter "charlie"
//   got:    ["alphab", "ravoc", "harlie"]
//
// The fix makes the editor's own caret the authority: on a split it takes the
// keyboard from the DOM, buffers input while the caret is in flight, and replays
// it into the target once that block can actually hold a caret. Input follows the
// model, not the DOM.
//
// SCOPE: this gate only proves the FAST path — on an idle box the flight window
// is short, so it catches a regression that reopens the gap for ordinary typing,
// not one that merely lengthens a window still narrower than the harness's own
// keystroke cadence. The deterministic long-window case (a handle withheld
// indefinitely, so the flight cannot land at all) is the jsdom test
// `web/__tests__/caret-authority.test.tsx`. Rerunning this under host load (a few
// concurrent `./singularity build`s) reproduces the original conditions.
//

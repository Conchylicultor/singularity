// Reopen-an-edited-block regression (per-block CRDT plan,
// research/2026-07-07-page-per-block-crdt-plan-b.md).
//
// The bug this pins down: `connect()`'s instant pre-seed (Stage 4a) fired for
// EVERY first connect — including an existing, previously-edited block on a
// cold page load — because the "row confirmed" / "server state" signals arrive
// from PARENT effects that run after the child CollaborationPlugin's connect.
// The pre-seed (hashed from the CURRENT projected `data.text`) then merged
// with the stored doc (original seed + live-edit items under other clientIDs):
// two independent CRDT encodings of the same visible text → the paragraph
// rendered TWICE, and the projection persisted the doubled runs, compounding
// on every reopen.
//
// Scenario:
//  1. create a blank page, type a distinctive string into its text block;
//  2. wait for the doc flush AND the `data.text` projection to land;
//  3. COLD-reopen the page (a fresh browser context — a same-context reload
//     restores the persisted tab set onto the Pages landing instead of the
//     deep link, so a new context is the real "reopen" path); assert the
//     block shows the text EXACTLY ONCE — in the DOM, in `data.text`, and in
//     the decoded `page_block_docs` state;
//  4. reopen again to prove it does not compound.
//
// NOTE on reproducibility: with the CURRENT @lexical/react (0.44),
// CollaborationPlugin happens to defer provider.connect() by two internal
// commits, so the owning hook's markBlockRowConfirmed effect wins the race
// and this e2e passes even before the construction-time-discriminator fix —
// the connect-before-latch interleave is only reachable at the provider
// contract level. The failing-then-fixed reproducer for that mechanism is
// plugins/page/plugins/editor/web/__tests__/live-state-yjs-provider.test.ts;
// this e2e pins the end-to-end invariant against regressions in either layer.

// Inline mark boundary caret — the virtual delimiter position
// (research/2026-08-06-page-inline-mark-boundary-caret.md, "Verification").
//
// A block ENDING with a marked run traps the caret inside the mark: `` `zz` `` at
// the end of a block is ONE TextNode carrying the `code` bit, and
// `offset === getTextContentSize()` is the last position that exists — so there
// is no "outside the span" to type plain text in. The fix gives every mark
// boundary one VIRTUAL stop (an invisible one-character delimiter, markdown-source
// style): ArrowRight steps onto it, ArrowLeft steps back inside, Backspace at it
// deletes the delimiter — i.e. strips the mark from the span.
//
// THE RULE: a boundary has TWO caret states, carrying the LEFT run's marks and
// the RIGHT run's; the browser hands you one (`natural`) and the stop is the
// OTHER one. A block edge is modelled as an empty unmarked neighbour, which is
// what makes block-start, block-end and mid-block one code path.
//
// Assertions run against the PERSISTED ROWS (`GET /api/pages/:pageId/blocks`)
// wherever the claim is about the data model — that is the only thing that proves
// the marks travelled Lexical → the block's `Y.Doc` → the ~1s `data.text`
// projection, and a DOM-only read would pass on a mark that never left the
// browser. It matters more here than in the sibling `inline-format-verify.ts`:
// `selection.format` is not readable from the DOM at all, so every claim about
// caret DEPTH can only be proven by what gets TYPED and persisted. The DOM is
// read for two things only — the caret's linear offset (the press-count claims of
// phase 6) and the rendered `<code>`/`<strong>` in the convergence phase.
//
// Phases:
//  1. `` `zz` ``, ArrowRight, SETTLE, `x` → [{zz,code},{x}]. THE load-bearing
//     assertion — see the long comment on that phase for why the settle is what
//     makes it one;
//  2. the step is reversible: same, then ArrowLeft, SETTLE, `x` → one {zzx,code}
//     run (the caret stepped back INSIDE the span);
//  3. Backspace at the stop deletes the delimiter: `` `zz` ``, ArrowRight,
//     Backspace → one UNMARKED `zz`; ONE Cmd+Z restores the `code` mark and
//     nothing else (the `stopCapturing()` fence on both sides of the strip);
//  4. THE `escaped` GATE — the safety property. Three shipped mechanisms produce
//     `selection.format ≠ node format` with no arrow step in sight, and under a
//     DERIVED depth each would make Backspace strip a whole span instead of
//     deleting a character. All three must take the ordinary deletion:
//     (a) `FormatShortcutsPlugin`'s collapsed-caret Cmd+E,
//     (b) `applyInlineFormat`'s `preFormat` restore after any autoformat,
//     (c) a programmatic merge landing at the end of a bold run;
//  5. block START is the same code path (the edge is an empty unmarked
//     neighbour): a block whose first run is bold — ArrowLeft, type → an unmarked
//     run lands FIRST;
//  6. a MID-BLOCK seam owns its stop too, and the mid-block case was broken
//     before this feature: Chromium biases the seam to the END of the left run,
//     so typing at `` `zz`|abc `` with no step comes out `{code}`-MARKED. Three
//     blocks: the unstepped baseline, the stop, and the crossing;
//  7. convergence in a second browser context (cold load, fresh socket);
//  8. TRAVERSAL SYMMETRY — walking a `` `aaa`a `` block all the way across in
//     BOTH directions must visit the same caret states in reverse order. A
//     per-direction spot check cannot see a skipped stop, because a stop is only
//     ever skipped on one approach; this is the phase that catches it.
//  9. THE MIRRORED SEAM — `` a`aaa` ``, the marked run on the RIGHT. The stop
//     there is the state INSIDE the code run at its start, so typing at it
//     PREPENDS into the span. The retired `left ∩ right` rule synthesized no
//     stop at all here (it computed `{}`, which `natural` already carried), so
//     that state was unreachable — the exact mirror of the block-end bug this
//     whole feature exists to fix. Same shape as phase 6 plus the traversal walk
//     of phase 8, in the other orientation, plus the forward strip;
// 10. CROSS-BLOCK ARRIVAL — a horizontal crossing INTO a block whose facing edge
//     is a mark boundary must meet the stop first, exactly as a within-block step
//     does. The block seam is a place the browser's own landing is the far state;
//     a click into the same position must NOT assert the stop.
// 11. CROSSING AN INLINE DECORATOR — the third arrival path, and the one the
//     caret-crossing channel exists for
//     (research/2026-08-08-global-caret-crossing-channel.md). A `` `code` `` run
//     next to a `[[page]]` chip: one arrow across the chip must land on the
//     boundary's stop, not inside the code run. Also pins the `selectNext(0, 0)`
//     fix and the Backspace-strip whose neighbour is a decorator;
//
// Manual-only; nothing runs this automatically.

  // --- Phase 6: a mid-block seam owns its stop, and always needed one ---------
  //
  // MEASURED — and it falsified the design's one assumption. The plan predicted
  // that `` `zz`|plain `` would need NO stop: `L = {code}`, `R = {}`,
  // `L ∩ R = {}`, and the plain run's own start position already carries `{}`.
  // That reasoning is sound only if Chromium resolves the seam to the PLAIN node.
  // It does not — it biases to the END of the code node (the `caretInsideCode`
  // probe below reads `true`), so the caret's NATURAL marks there are `{code}`,
  // they differ from the plain run's, and `virtualStop` synthesizes a stop like
  // at any other boundary.
  //
  // Two consequences, and the second is why this phase now opens with a baseline:
  //
  //  - EVERY boundary costs one extra press, not only the disjoint-mark seams the
  //    plan expected. That is the trade taken deliberately — the caret behaves
  //    the same everywhere — not a regression to tune away.
  //  - THE MID-BLOCK CASE WAS BROKEN BEFORE THIS FEATURE. Under the left bias,
  //    typing at the seam produced a `{code}`-MARKED character in a run the user
  //    is typing outside of. So the feature fixes mid-block; it does not merely
  //    extend block edges. Phase 6a is the only assertion in this file that says
  //    so, and it is the whole regression value of the mid-block half.
  //
  // The stop's DIRECTION needed no change for any of this, because it asks the
  // LIVE anchor what its marks are instead of predicting the browser. The finding
  // cost a test expectation, not a redesign — which is the argument for keeping
  // it derived from the anchor if anyone is ever tempted to precompute it.

  // OPPOSITE ends of the two sequences — that is the symmetry, and reversing one

  // --- Phase 11: CROSSING AN INLINE DECORATOR --------------------------------
  //
  // The third way a caret can ARRIVE at a mark boundary, and the one this file
  // did not cover: not a step within a block (phases 1-9) and not a crossing from
  // an adjacent block (phase 10), but a crossing over an inline DECORATOR —
  // a `[[page]]` chip, a `@date` chip, a pasted image. Design:
  // research/2026-08-08-global-caret-crossing-channel.md.
  //
  // The defect it pins, stated as data: in `` `code`[chip] ``, ArrowLeft from the
  // end of the block landed INSIDE the code run, so the very next character typed
  // came out `{code}`-marked at a caret that is visually past the span. Phase 8
  // asserts exactly that claim one press away from a decorator, and passed —
  // which is the point. `decorator-nav` moves the caret with Lexical node APIs
  // (`selectPrevious()` / `selectNext(0, 0)`), and NO selection transition tells
  // the mark model that a crossing happened. Only the mover knows, so only the
  // mover can say so: `crossCaret` performs the move and announces it as one act,
  // and the page editor's arrival observer lands the stop.
  //
  // It cannot be generalised into the mark lookahead either, and that is worth
  // knowing before "simplifying" this away: `markArriveFor` works in the LINEAR
  // OFFSET basis, where a decorator occupies `tokenOf(node).length` characters
  // (`block-text-extensions.ts`), so "one caret step left" is NOT `offset - 1`
  // beside a chip — `$resolveLinearOffset(off - 1)` lands inside the chip and
  // correctly answers null. Announcement is the only mechanism that reaches
  // across a decorator.
  //
  // THE FIXTURE IS A PASTE, not typing. `decidePaste` sends MULTI-LINE
  // `text/plain` through `parseMarkdownToForest` (so `[[<pageId>]]` is a
  // protected span that becomes a real chip node, and `` `code` `` becomes a
  // marked run); a SINGLE-line paste falls through to the native inline paste and
  // would leave a literal `[[…]]` token sitting in the text — a fixture that
  // looks right and crosses no decorator at all. Hence the trailing `sentinel`
  // line, which doubles as the block the rightward walk of 11e exits into.

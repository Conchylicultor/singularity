// Causally dependent structural writes reach the server IN ISSUE ORDER — read
// off the AUTHORITATIVE rows, in a real browser.
// See research/2026-08-01-page-structural-write-contract.md (invariant B).
//
// The defect: a `convertTo` (the `- ` markdown shortcut) and the `split` that
// inherits its type were independent POSTs, so the browser could deliver them in
// either order. Arriving reversed, the split committed against a paragraph and
// the user's bullet silently reverted ONE PUSH LATER — the client had predicted
// both ops correctly, so nothing on screen said anything was wrong until the
// authoritative snapshot landed.
//
// Latent for months because a human pauses between structural edits; the caret
// authority replays buffered keystrokes with NO pause, so it became routine.
// Every keystroke here is therefore issued with ZERO delay and no settle: the
// race is the test.
//
// **The assertion reads `GET /api/pages/:pageId/blocks`, not the DOM.** The DOM
// is the optimistic overlay, which is right by construction — it applied the two
// ops in issue order locally. Only server truth can disagree, and only server
// truth is what survives a reload.

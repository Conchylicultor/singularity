// Duplicate is a `BlockOp` — verified in a real browser.
// See research/2026-07-30-page-record-bulkduplicate-on-the-undo-stack.md
//
// The defect: `bulkDuplicate` was the LAST editor mutation reachable from
// `useBlockEditor()` that put nothing on the shared undo stack, because it minted
// its row ids server-side (`POST /blocks/bulk-duplicate`) and so had no
// client-computed after-state to invert. Cmd+Z after the selection bar's
// Duplicate button (or Cmd+D) therefore consumed an OLDER history entry while the
// clones stayed behind. Same root cause, second symptom: no optimistic overlay, so
// a large selection showed nothing until the round-trip AND the push landed.
//
// The fix makes duplicate a `{ kind: "duplicate", placements }` op routed through
// `dispatchOp` — the one path that records an undo entry and builds an overlay —
// with ids minted client-side, exactly as paste does. Phases:
//   A. Cmd+D on ONE selected block: exactly one clone, immediately after its source
//   B. a multi-root selection including a parent with a child: each root's whole
//      SUBTREE is cloned, and each clone lands right after its own source
//   C. Cmd+Z removes exactly the clones and nothing else — the reported symptom's
//      inverse, which is why A's clone is still on the stack underneath: if undo
//      reaches for the wrong entry, A's clone vanishes and B's survive
//   D. Cmd+Shift+Z restores them (an undo whose redo cannot land is half a fix)
//   E. optimism: with the op endpoint stalled 4s, the clones render long before
//      the server could answer, ONE op POST covers the whole multi-root gesture,
//      and the confirming push neither duplicates nor drops them
//

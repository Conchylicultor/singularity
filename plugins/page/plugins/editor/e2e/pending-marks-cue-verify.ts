// The collapsed caret's pending-mark cue — "what will the next character carry"
// (research/2026-08-09-page-collapsed-caret-pending-marks-cue.md, "Verification").
//
// A collapsed caret carries a PENDING MARK SET that decides how the next typed
// character is formatted, and until this feature nothing on screen said so: two
// positions that behave differently were pixel-identical. The affordance is two
// arms — show the pending set while the caret stands AT A MARK BOUNDARY (either
// of its two states), or while that set DISAGREES with the marks of the text the
// caret is standing in.
//
// The boundary arm is why phases 3 and 5 read the way they do. Naming only the
// divergent state of a boundary labels one of its two positions and leaves the
// other blank, which is half an affordance: the pair `` `zz|` `` (code) ⇄
// `` `zz`| `` (plain) IS the feature. The divergent arm still extinguishes on
// the next character (phase 2), and ordinary prose still shows nothing at all
// (phase 7), because a run with the void on either side of it is no boundary.
//
// THE SUBJECT OF THIS FILE IS THE DOM, and that is why it is its own script
// rather than a phase of `mark-boundary-verify.ts`. That sibling drives exactly
// the same caret positions (autoformat `` `zz` ``, ArrowRight/ArrowLeft across a
// boundary, the mirrored `` a`zz` `` seam) but asserts the PERSISTED ROWS,
// because its claims are about the data model. Every claim here is about what is
// PAINTED, so every assertion reads the rendered chip and nothing else. Mixing
// the two subjects in one driver is how a DOM-only pass gets mistaken for a data
// claim — so the blocks API is touched here for exactly one thing, the doc-init
// gate in `enterNewBlock`, and never as an assertion subject.
//
// THE PINNED DOM CONTRACT (agreed with the implementation): the chip's outermost
// element carries `data-caret-format-cue="<label>"`, and `<label>` is also its
// visible text. Labels are lowercase, space-joined, in the order
// `bold italic underline strikethrough code`; the empty mark set renders as
// `plain`. So: `plain`, `code`, `bold`, `bold code`.
//
// Phases (each: perform the input, settle past Lexical's format-carry window,
// then read the chip):
//  1. `` `zz` `` autoformats into a `{code}` run → chip reads **plain** with no
//     further keystroke. `applyInlineFormat` restores `preFormat` onto the
//     post-transform caret, so the next character is unmarked — the invisible
//     case that predates the mark-boundary feature entirely;
//  2. type one more character → chip GONE. The self-extinguishing half, and the
//     assertion that the chip is not simply stuck on;
//  3. THE LOAD-BEARING PAIR — the two states of one boundary, named. Fresh
//     `` `zz` ``: ArrowRight → **plain** (the stop, outside the span), ArrowLeft
//     → **code** (back inside), ArrowRight → **plain**. Same pixel, same linear
//     offset, two words. Before this feature neither press painted anything;
//  4. the OTHER two sources, which need no arrow step: Cmd+E on plain text →
//     **code**, then Cmd+B → **bold code** (the label ORDER assertion), then
//     Cmd+E again → **bold**;
//  5. the MIRRORED seam `` a`zz` ``: the seam's natural state → **plain** (left
//     `{}`, right `{code}` is a boundary, so the boundary arm names it), and one
//     ArrowRight into the code run's start → **code**;
//  6. the chip is not sticky: a click elsewhere in the block clears it, and so
//     does blurring the editor. Both re-armed with a fresh Cmd+E first, so
//     neither half can pass vacuously;
//  7. an ordinary plain paragraph never shows it — read after EVERY character,
//     not only at the end.
//
// Manual-only; nothing runs this automatically.

  // dispatched the format once from its own keydown branch and this editor's
  // shortcut table dispatched it again, toggling the mark straight back off. They
  // were deliberately left red rather than weakened, and they are what made a
  // defect visible that nothing had ever displayed before this cue existed. Fixed

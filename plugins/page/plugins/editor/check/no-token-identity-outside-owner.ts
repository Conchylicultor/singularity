/**
 * A token family's IDENTITY belongs to the plugins that declare it — the one
 * that owns the shape and the one that registers it as a token. No consumer
 * outside them may name it.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * `read-only-view/runs-renderer.tsx` used to import `PAGE_LINK_TOKEN_PATTERN`
 * and `INLINE_MATH_TOKEN_PATTERN` and race the two hardcoded regexes against
 * each line. Nothing was wrong with the code it named — the problem was that it
 * named anything at all: the closed set it hardcoded had exactly two members,
 * and when `inline-date` shipped a third nobody edited the renderer. So
 * `[[date:…]]` rendered as literal brackets on every read-only surface (page
 * history, diffs, agent notes) for as long as it took someone to notice. The
 * renderer is registry-driven now; this is what keeps it that way, and keeps
 * the next consumer from re-opening the same hole somewhere else.
 *
 * ## Why a CHECK and not a lint rule
 *
 * A contributed lint rule runs REPO-WIDE (the root eslint config enables every
 * `plugins/*​/lint/` rule as an error over `**​/*.{ts,tsx}`), and "may this file
 * name that identifier?" is a question about the RELATIONSHIP between two
 * paths — the referencing file and the declaring plugin's subtree. An
 * ESLint rule sees one file at a time and would have to hardcode the owners to
 * answer it, which is the very thing being banned. Same reasoning as
 * `active-data/check/index.ts`'s scoped check, one level up: that one is
 * path-scoped, this one is path-RELATIVE.
 *
 * ## What counts as a token identity, and how the set is discovered
 *
 * Nothing is hardcoded — a fifth token family is governed the day it registers,
 * with no edit here:
 *
 * - a **node spec**: `export const X = defineInlineTokenNode(…)`.
 * - a **token pattern**: a SCREAMING_CASE identifier passed as `pattern:` to one
 *   of the three registrars (`inlineChip`, `tokenExtension`,
 *   `Editor.InlineToken`). Being registered as a token's pattern is what makes
 *   an identifier a token identity — which is exactly why a plugin may still
 *   compose a pattern out of an id shape somebody else owns (`PROTOTYPE_ID_RE`
 *   from the prototypes domain): a shape nobody registers as a token is not a
 *   token identity, and deriving a pattern from the mint's own shape is the good
 *   pattern, not the banned one.
 *
 * ## Who owns one
 *
 * A family's identity is held JOINTLY by the plugin that declares the shape
 * (`export const X`) and every plugin that registers it as a token. Both are
 * acts of declaring the family; what is banned is a THIRD party — a consumer —
 * naming it. So `improve/element-picker` may name `UI_CONTEXT_RE`, which the
 * `ui-context` primitive declares and the picker turns into a chip, while a
 * renderer that merely wants to draw the result may not name either.
 *
 * Ownership is by SUBTREE: a plugin directory is the nearest ancestor with a
 * `package.json`, and everything under it is inside — that is how active-data's
 * four chip sub-plugins each name the one shared `activeDataInlineNode` from
 * their parent's `core/`.
 *
 * Only IMPORTS count as naming it. A local `const corpusTokenNode = …` in
 * someone else's test is a different binding that happens to share a name, not
 * a reach into another plugin's identity.
 *
 * The `page.editor` server registry is not exempted and needs no exemption: it
 * reads `Editor.InlineToken.getContributions()` generically and names no
 * family. If it ever has to name one, that is the defect, not the check.

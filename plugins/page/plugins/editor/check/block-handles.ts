/**
 * The two web block SLOT OBJECTS, resolved once per call from the declaration
 * pass that named them, so every loop that reads a block contribution compares
 * by IDENTITY instead of against an id string.
 *
 * Identity is the point, not ergonomics. These loops used to read `c._slotId` —
 * a field that stopped existing when contributions moved to `_slot: SlotHandle`
 * — so the predicate was always true, `handles` was always empty, and two checks
 * verified nothing for as long as it took to notice. There is no field name and
 * no id string left in the loop to go stale: a wrong id fails HERE, at one named
 * line, and a wrong field is a type error.
 *
 * `"registry"` scope, and it costs nothing: every caller has already awaited
 * `buildEnrichedTree`, which awaits this very memoized pass. It is the DECLARING
 * plugin — the editor — that must be in scope, never the candidate plugin whose
 * barrel is read: a contribution carries the same slot OBJECT whether or not its
 * own plugin is disabled, so identity still catches a disabled block type.
 *
 * A miss returns `{ ok: false }` and never throws: the runner awaits every check
 * under `Promise.all` and rethrows, so one throw in here would kill every other
 * check's reporting.

 * source scan cannot recover a handle's fields from
 * `Editor.Block({ match: fooBlock.type, block: fooBlock })`, and ad-hoc marker
 * scanning is banned outright — so importing is the only way, and doing it once
 * is what keeps a new check from re-deriving "which dirs" and drifting on the
 * empty-set failure mode. Barrel modules are Bun-cached, so the repeat imports
 * across checks cost nothing.
 *
 * Fails (`{ ok: false }`) rather than returning an empty list — whether the block
 * slot could not be resolved, the facet yielded no candidate dirs, or those dirs
 * yielded no handles: a check that verified NOTHING must fail loudly rather than
 * pass vacuously. Each caller words the failure in its own terms and appends
 * `reason`, so the three degradations stay distinguishable instead of collapsing
 * into one message that names only the likeliest of them. A caller with no
 * report to write takes {@link loadBlockHandles}, which turns the same three
 * into a throw.

 * `"registry"` scope, and it costs nothing: every caller has already awaited
 * `buildEnrichedTree`, which awaits this very memoized pass. It is the DECLARING
 * plugin — the editor — that must be in scope, never the candidate plugin whose
 * barrel is read: a contribution carries the same slot OBJECT whether or not its
 * own plugin is disabled, so identity still catches a disabled block type.
 *
 * A miss returns `{ ok: false }` and never throws: the runner awaits every check

 * contribution (see `web/slots.ts` for why it rides there and not on a slot of
 * its own). Two declarations, each where it is needed, and nothing in the type
 * system ties them together.
 *
 * A handle claiming anchorhood with no decoration is not cosmetic: the reducer
 * treats the type as a void container (its row renders no line, and while it has
 * visible children the surface collapses that row to ZERO height), while the
 * surface paints nothing into the column — an invisible container. This check is
 * what stops the two from silently disagreeing.
 *
 * Both facts are read by IMPORTING the same web barrels the docgen tree already
 * imports (a static source scan cannot recover `anchor` off
 * `Editor.Block({ match: fooBlock.type, block: fooBlock })`, and ad-hoc marker
 * scanning is banned outright). The barrel module is Bun-cached, so re-importing

/**
 * no-adhoc-doc-write
 *
 * A block's content lives in ONE canonical `Y.Doc` per block, held by its
 * `BlockDocOwner` (`web/internal/collab-session.ts`). Exactly three transaction
 * origins may reach that doc, and the run tracker's whole classification is
 * stated over them: the transport provider (a server apply or a seed), the
 * replay origin (`TEXT_REPLAY_ORIGIN`, a data undo entry replaying), and the
 * binding, relayed verbatim (the user typing). A fourth writer — some module
 * calling `applyUpdate(owner.doc, …)` under an origin of its own — would be
 * read by the tracker as the user typing (a run opened and recorded for an
 * edit nobody typed), by the transport as bytes to flush, and by every
 * mounted binding as a remote change, with no entry anywhere that could undo
 * it. So a write onto an owner's doc is only ever legal from the modules that
 * ARE those three origins:
 *
 *  - `web/internal/block-text-write.ts` — the replay host (host A);
 *  - `web/internal/live-state-yjs-provider.ts` and `local-yjs-provider.ts` —
 *    the transport providers;
 *  - `web/internal/binding-replica.ts` — the relay that carries the binding's
 *    transactions onto the canonical.
 *
 * Those four are exempted by PATH in the lint barrel. This rule flags every
 * other `applyUpdate(<doc>, …)` / `Y.applyUpdate(<doc>, …)` call whose first
 * argument is an owner-shaped doc: a `.doc` member read off something that is
 * not a call (`owner.doc`, `this.doc`, `session.owner.doc`,
 * `blockDocOwnerOf(id)?.doc`), or a local whose declaration binds one
 * (resolved through the scope, so a `doc` minted in one function is never
 * confused with an owner's read in another). A doc minted in place
 * (`new Doc()`, `runsToXmlText(runs).doc` — a headless replica, never an
 * owner's) is untouched: splicing a throwaway doc is what the replay hosts do,
 * and what the tests do.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins.

/**
 * no-adhoc-forest-write
 *
 * `page_blocks` is a forest with two non-deferrable partial unique indexes over
 * `(parent_id, rank)` and a denormalized `page_id` partition, and every
 * structural writer is a read-modify-write over the whole thing. Two concurrent
 * writers that each read the pre-state and write back a full row silently
 * reassert each other's columns — the captured incident is a `split` carrying
 * `parentId` from a pre-indent read, un-indenting a block with nothing to
 * observe it. So a forest write is only ever legal inside a transaction holding
 * that page's advisory lock.
 *
 * The TYPE closes the transitive half: every helper in
 * `server/internal/forest-writer.ts` requires a `PageForestTx`, which only
 * `withPageForest` can mint, so a handler that opens a bare `db.transaction`
 * fails to compile. This rule closes the DIRECT half: a future writer cannot
 * skip the helpers by importing `_blocks` and writing it by hand.
 *
 * It flags drizzle MUTATION calls naming the blocks table —
 * `.insert(_blocks)` / `.update(_blocks)` / `.delete(_blocks)` — anywhere but
 * `forest-writer.ts`, which is exempted by path in the lint barrel. Reads
 * (`.select().from(_blocks)`) are untouched: reading is what `ctx.forest()` is
 * for, and an unlocked read is not the hazard.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins.

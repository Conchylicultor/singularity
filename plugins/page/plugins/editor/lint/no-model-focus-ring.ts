/**
 * A focus indicator painted from a model boolean is an indicator that can
 * disagree with the browser.
 *
 * Focus already has a CSS state — `:focus-visible`, and the app's canonical
 * `focus-ring` / `focus-ring-within` / `focus-ring-from` utilities in `ui-kit`'s
 * `app.css`, which are that state given the app's look. A boolean named
 * `isFocused` is not that state: in the page editor it is
 * `focusedBlockId === block.id`, which is where the EDITOR thinks the caret is.
 * The two are separate facts, and they come apart — a block can hold real DOM
 * focus while the editor's state has moved on, or the other way round.
 *
 * Painting the indicator off the model is what makes the disagreement visible as
 * a bug. The page editor's divider suppressed the browser's own outline
 * unconditionally (`outline-none`) and redrew a ring only while `isFocused`, so a
 * box that HAD DOM focus while the editor disagreed showed no indicator at all:
 * the user's keyboard focus was somewhere nothing was drawn. Two conditions, one
 * indicator — and the one the browser knows about had been switched off.
 *
 * So the rule anchors on the GATE, not on an element name: a focus/ring/outline
 * token sitting in a branch that only renders because `isFocused` is (or is not)
 * true. Everything else about the token is read the way
 * `row/no-row-focus-class` reads it — `!` stripped in both spellings, the variant
 * chain split bracket-aware so `has-[:focus-visible]:ring-2` and
 * `[&:focus]:outline-none` are seen for what they are, and a token trips on an
 * `outline-*` / `ring-*` / `focus-ring-*` base OR a `focus`/`focus-visible`/
 * `focus-within` variant anywhere in its chain.
 *
 * The two fixes, per what the author actually meant:
 *   - "this element has keyboard focus" → the `focus-ring` utility family, which
 *     fires from `:focus-visible` and therefore cannot drift from the browser.
 *   - "the editor's caret is on this block" → nothing at all, for a text-less
 *     block: it registers `caret: "editor"` and `BlockRow` mounts the cue for
 *     it. A block that must hold the caret itself (`caret: "renderer"`) uses
 *     `Row`'s `selected`, which paints the same tint. That is a different
 *     question from focus and it reads as a different cue, so the two may
 *     legally layer.
 *
 * No auto-fix: deleting the styling versus declaring `caret: "editor"` is a
 * per-site judgement.

/**
 * Tests for the `no-model-focus-ring` lint rule. Run with `./singularity test
 * plugins/page/plugins/editor`.
 *
 * The first invalid case is the acceptance test the rule exists for: the page
 * editor's divider as it stood — the browser's own outline switched off
 * unconditionally, and a ring redrawn only while the EDITOR's `isFocused` said
 * so. The first valid case is the shape that replaces it, and it must pass: the
 * `focus-ring` utility authored unconditionally (the browser decides when it
 * draws), with the model gate left to tint, not to indicate focus.

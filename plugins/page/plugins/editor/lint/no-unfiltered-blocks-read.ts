/**
 * no-unfiltered-blocks-read
 *
 * Every block delete is a TRASH: the `page_blocks` row stays, flagged
 * `deleted_at`, until purge (`server/internal/trash-blocks.ts`). So a plain
 * `.from(_blocks)` reads trashed rows alongside live ones, and a reader that
 * forgets the predicate resurrects deleted content — into a live resource, a
 * search index, a backlink panel, an agent's markdown read. The predicate is
 * easy to forget because nothing about the table's spelling asks for it.
 *
 * The fix is a relation on which the predicate is never written:
 * `liveBlocks` (`server/internal/live-blocks.ts`), a drizzle subquery over
 * `page_blocks WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, exported from the editor's server
 * barrel beside `_blocks`. A reader `.from(liveBlocks)` cannot forget the
 * filter because it does not spell one. This rule closes the other route: it
 * flags every drizzle READ that names the raw table —
 * `.from(_blocks)` and `.<inner|left|right|full>Join(_blocks, …)` — anywhere
 * but the trash machinery, which is exempted by path in the lint barrel
 * (`ignores`): the modules that must see trashed rows to trash, restore, purge,
 * walk a cascade set, resolve a scope, or park a rank around them.
 *
 * Raw `sql\`… page_blocks …\`` reads are not seen by this rule (an AST rule
 * cannot read a template literal for SQL). They live under the same
 * allowlist convention — `collect-subtree.ts`, `page-doc-order.ts` and
 * `page-id.ts` are the three, each stating whether it filters and why — and a
 * new raw read belongs in an allowlisted module, never in a reader.
 *
 * Mutations (`.insert/.update/.delete(_blocks)`) are `no-adhoc-forest-write`'s.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins.

/**
 * no-unhistoried-block-field
 *
 * Every editing surface on screen belongs to SOME undo history. In the page
 * body that is not automatic, and getting it wrong is silent.
 *
 * The block list declares `data-undo-owner="surface"` (`surfaceUndoProps`, in
 * `web/components/block-editor.tsx`), because the page deliberately keeps ONE
 * chronological document stack instead of a per-block Lexical history. Undo
 * resolution is by nearest declaring ancestor, so that declaration covers every
 * raw `<textarea>` / `<input>` / `contenteditable` rendered anywhere beneath
 * it. A field that declares nothing therefore does not keep its own history —
 * it hands `mod+z` to the surface stack, which `preventDefault()`s the key, and
 * the browser's own field history (the one that undoes a paste correctly) never
 * runs. What the user gets instead is an unrelated earlier document edit
 * reversed while they are typing.
 *
 * That bug shipped twice, byte for byte (`code-block`, `math/equation`), and
 * three more block fields carried the routing half of it. Nothing caught any of
 * them: the editor's undo test enforces "every mutation records one entry", and
 * a field that records nothing while you type is invisible to it. This rule is
 * the check that was missing.
 *
 * There are exactly two right answers, and the message names both:
 *
 *  - **Persisted block text** → `<BlockTextArea>` from
 *    `@plugins/page/plugins/editor/web`, which records each typing run onto the
 *    document stack synchronously and persists on its own timer.
 *  - **Transient chrome** (a URL prompt, a search box — nothing the page
 *    stores) → spread `localUndoProps` from
 *    `@plugins/primitives/plugins/undo-redo/web`, handing `mod+z` back to the
 *    browser.
 *
 * WHAT IS FLAGGED. Only INTRINSIC elements — a lowercase JSX name is a real DOM
 * node with a real browser history to lose. `<RichTextPlugin contentEditable={…}>`
 * is a Lexical render prop, not a DOM attribute, and `<ContentEditable>` is a
 * component that carries its own declaration; neither is this rule's business.
 * An `<input>` counts only when its `type` is statically absent (defaulting to
 * `text`) or a literal text-ish type — mirroring `resolveUndoOwner`'s own set.
 * A checkbox or file picker has no text history to protect, and forcing a
 * `local` marker onto one would silence ⌘Z right after ticking it, which is the
 * one moment the user most wants it. A computed `type` is left alone for the
 * same reason: it may well be a checkbox.
 *
 * SCOPE. A contributed rule is enabled repo-wide, but only the page body
 * declares a surface-undo region around its fields — a raw textarea is ordinary
 * everywhere else. So the rule checks the filename and stays silent outside
 * `plugins/page/` and outside a `web/` runtime. Test and e2e files are already
 * exempt (NON_APP_FILE_GLOBS); `<BlockTextArea>`'s own implementation is
 * exempted by path in the lint barrel.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins. The attribute name, the marker's identifier and the text-ish
 * type set below are therefore INLINED copies — the source of truth for all
 * three is
 * `plugins/primitives/plugins/undo-redo/web/internal/undo-owner.ts`.

/**
 * no-adhoc-structural-write
 *
 * A page's structural writes are ONE ORDERED STREAM. `optimistic-mutation`'s
 * model is `data = pendingOps.reduce(apply, serverTruth)` — an ordered fold — so
 * two causally dependent writes that leave as independent POSTs can land in
 * either order: the captured incident is a `split` reaching the server before
 * the `convertTo` it depended on, silently reverting the user's bullet one push
 * later.
 *
 * Order is therefore a property of the send lane the primitive keys by
 * `(resource, params)`, and the ONLY way onto that lane is the page's own
 * `useOptimisticResource` instance (`web/block-store.ts`) or the composite
 * router that fans writes out to it (`web/composite-block-store.tsx`, which also
 * owns the two lane-enqueued writes that carry no overlay). Every other caller
 * of the two structural endpoints would be a write outside the stream.
 *
 * So this rule flags `fetchEndpoint` / `useEndpointMutation` naming
 * `applyBlockOpEndpoint` or `patchBlocks` anywhere but those two files, which
 * the lint barrel exempts by PATH. It is the ORDER half of the guardrail; the
 * server-side ATOMICITY half is `no-adhoc-forest-write` plus the unforgeable
 * `PageForestTx` brand. Neither half is sufficient.
 *
 * `moveBlock` is deliberately NOT in the flagged set: it is a live endpoint for
 * two surfaces whose writes no page overlay can predict (the Pages sidebar's
 * `docRank` order, and the editor's cross-page drop). Both still enqueue onto a
 * lane where ordering matters.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins.

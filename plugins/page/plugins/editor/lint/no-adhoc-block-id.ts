/**
 * no-adhoc-block-id
 *
 * A `page_blocks` id is minted from two sides — the client mints one before the
 * round trip so an optimistic op can render the block on the keystroke, the
 * server mints one for a row no editor is open on — and for two months each side
 * minted its OWN format: `block-<epoch-ms>-<6 base36 chars>` on the server, a
 * bare `crypto.randomUUID()` on the client. Nothing broke, because nothing
 * parses an id; what it cost was legibility. A page's URL announced which
 * handler had happened to create it, and the live table holds three shapes.
 *
 * `core/block-id.ts` is now the one mint (`newBlockId()`), and this rule is what
 * keeps it one. Inside the page-editor plugin it flags the two ways a second
 * format has actually appeared:
 *
 *  - `crypto.randomUUID()` — the client's old mint, and the tempting one-liner
 *    for anyone adding a `newId` to a new op.
 *  - a template literal interpolating directly after `block-` — the server's old
 *    mint, and any hand-rolled variation on it. The prefix must be the WHOLE
 *    leading text: an id is `block-` plus a generated body, so `block-text-${…}`
 *    (a Lexical namespace) is a different string that merely shares a stem.
 *
 * SCOPE. A contributed rule is enabled repo-wide, but only this plugin owns
 * block identity: `crypto.randomUUID()` is the correct, unremarkable call
 * everywhere else (reminder ids, tab ids, correlation ids), so the rule checks
 * the filename and stays silent outside `plugins/page/plugins/editor/`. Test and
 * e2e files are already exempt (NON_APP_FILE_GLOBS), which is what lets a
 * fixture keep writing readable `block-1`/`block-${i}` ids. `block-id.ts` itself
 * is exempted by path in the lint barrel.
 *
 * What this rule does NOT do is validate the format of an id it did not mint.
 * Rows created before `newBlockId()` existed keep their bare-uuid ids forever,
 * and they are re-inserted verbatim by an undo of a delete — so an id is an
 * opaque key on every path except the mint. See `core/block-id.ts`.
 *
 * AST-only and self-contained: a contributed lint rule file is loaded by jiti,
 * which cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias, so it may not import
 * across plugins.

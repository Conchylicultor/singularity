/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-doc-write` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.

 * The valid/invalid lists are the real shapes from the page editor's web tree:
 * a splice onto a throwaway headless doc must pass, every `applyUpdate` onto an
 * owner-shaped doc must fail (the four sanctioned homes — the replay host, the
 * two transport providers and the binding relay — are exempted by PATH in the
 * lint barrel, which this rule cannot and should not know about).

// All live pages (`type="page"` blocks), the WHOLE set (`all`): the sidebar
// renders every page, and the `[[` / page-link pickers filter it by title
// locally; the by-id readers (the page header, cover and kind control, the
// link chips, the pane resolvers) read one row of it through `:rows`
// (`useLiveRow`). The sidebar tree is built by `pageId` (the nearest page
// ancestor — `parentId` may point at a content block) and ordered by `docRank`
// — the persisted, writer-derived document-order key (see `PageRowSchema`),
// NOT the raw storage `rank`; the set's own order is `createdAt`, which never
// changes, so a re-minted `docRank` is an in-place row refill, never an
// `orderOf`.
//
// Served over the `page_blocks` TABLE (`../server/internal/page-rows.ts`):
// a rename, an icon, cover or kind change is that page's refill, a re-mint the
// refill of exactly the re-minted pages, a create / restore an entrant, a trash
// an exit — and a write to a CONTENT block (the ~1s `data.text` typing
// projection) the refill of its page's ONE row: every row carries `editedAt`
// (`PageRowSchema`), read off a trigger-maintained rollup of its content's
// newest `updated_at` (`../server/internal/rollup-spec.ts`), so the edit moves
// it. A write the rollup does not read (a fold toggle) loads nothing.
//
// The key is NEW (`pages.tree`; it was the legacy push resource `pages`): a
// tab still running a bundle that subscribed the old key gets `unknown-key` — a
// `skew` verdict, the Reload prompt — rather than keyed deltas its non-keyed
// read cannot apply. Pinned by `../server/internal/pages-tree-oracle.test.ts`.
//
// Not preloaded: nothing reads it until the Pages app (or a page chip) mounts.

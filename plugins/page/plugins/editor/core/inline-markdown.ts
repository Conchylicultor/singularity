/**
 * Inline markdown formatting shortcuts: the delimiter table, plus the two pure
 * consumers of it —
 *
 *  - `matchInlineFormat`, which decides whether the character the user just
 *    typed CLOSED a span (typing-time autoformat), and
 *  - `serializeInlineMarkdown` / `parseInlineMarkdown`, the whole-string
 *    `RichText` ⇄ markdown pair used by `markdown.ts` for clipboard export and
 *    paste. They are NOT expressible in terms of `matchInlineFormat`: it clamps
 *    to the caret's line and demands the closer at end-of-string, because it
 *    answers a different question.
 *
 * The table is plain data in `core/` rather than a slot because `Mark` is a
 * closed, persisted `z.enum` with a fixed `MARK_ORDER` (`rich-text.ts`) — a
 * sixth mark is a core edit plus a migration, never a contribution. Being data
 * in a leaf module is also what lets the *server* reuse it: `markdown.ts`'s
 * `MdSerializeCtx.md` renders `**`/`_`/`` ` `` on clipboard export through the
 * pair below, so a second copy of the delimiters there could drift from the one
 * the editor types against.
 *
 * This is a syntax layer ABOVE the persisted model, so it imports `Mark` /
 * `sortMarks` from `./rich-text` instead of being appended to it. Nothing here
 * touches Lexical or the DOM: the whole decision is a function of the line text
 * before the caret, which is what makes it `bun:test`-able with no editor
 * bootstrap (`inline-markdown.test.ts`).

// THE ESCAPING RULE, stated once (both directions implement exactly this):
//
//   On serialize, every literal occurrence of one of
//
//        \  *  _  ~  `  [  ]  <
//
//   is prefixed with a backslash. That is precisely the set of characters that
//   can BEGIN a construct this parser recognizes — a delimiter row's tag
//   (`*`, `_`, `~`, `` ` ``), a link (`[`, with `]` closing its text), a tag
//   (`<`) — plus the escape character itself. On parse, a backslash followed by
//   one of those characters yields the character alone; a backslash followed by
//   anything else is a literal backslash (CommonMark's rule, restricted to the
//   set we own).
//
//   Nothing else is escaped: `(`, `)`, `>`, `#` and `-` carry no INLINE meaning
//   here, and block-level syntax is `markdown.ts`'s concern. Inside a URL the
//   set is narrower — `\` and `)` only — because a URL is read verbatim up to
//   its first unescaped `)`.
//
// PROTECTED SPANS (`\(latex\)`, `[[page:…]]`, `[[date:…]]`, …) are matched
// FIRST and masked out of the scan in both directions: their bytes are emitted
// verbatim on serialize (never escaped) and taken verbatim on parse (never
// scanned for delimiters). Inline LaTeX is full of `_` and `*`, which is the
// whole reason this parameter exists. A protected span becomes its OWN run
// carrying no marks and no color — byte-for-byte what `runs-lexical.ts`'s
// `walkNode` produces for a decorator node — though it does inherit an enclosing
// link, as that walk does too.
//
// CANONICAL OUTPUT, and the identity it buys: a delimiter may never flank
// whitespace (`matchInlineFormat`'s two whitespace rules, mirrored below so what
// the user can TYPE and what pasted text PARSES as cannot diverge), so the
// serializer HOISTS boundary whitespace out of every delimiter-marked group
// first — `**a **` is emitted as `**a** `. That is invisible when rendered (a
// mark on a space paints nothing) and makes the round trip exact:
//
//     parseInlineMarkdown(serializeInlineMarkdown(runs, p), p) === canonical(runs)
//
// where `canonical` is `coalesce`, plus that hoist, plus splitting a protected
// span off into its own unmarked run — and is the identity on anything the
// editor produces from a selection that does not straddle a space, because that
// is exactly the shape `runs-lexical.ts` reads back out of Lexical.

// The orchestrator is parameterized on `BlockHandle[]`, and this suite hands it
// the REAL ONES: every block type the app ships, read off the plugin tree by
// `loadBlockHandles()`, which imports each contributing plugin's web barrel and
// throws rather than handing back an empty set.
//
// The loader is test code (`./testing`), host-only (it walks the plugin tree
// and imports web barrels at runtime), so it reaches the block plugins without
// a static import of them. A static import of the block plugins' own cores
// would be a cycle: each of them imports `defineBlock` from this plugin's core.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, because it is the reason for the cost below: a
// hand-written copy of 26 handles, which was wrong about exactly the tags
// `edit_page` depends on. It spelled the agent's card `<agent-notes>` where the
// real one is `<agent-inline id="…">`, gave `<todo>` and `<human>` no row id at
// all, knew two of the callout's five colours, and did not have `instructions`
// or `place` in it. So the round-trip property — the executable statement that
// markdown is a lossless projection of the forest — was a statement about a
// document nobody ever writes. A slow honest test is worth more than a fast one
// about a fiction.
//
// The load is a TOP-LEVEL `await`, deliberately not a `beforeAll`: it takes
// ~11 s (it builds the enriched plugin tree, then evaluates 28 web barrels,
// `lexical` and `react-icons` among them), and Bun's default per-test timeout is
// 5 s, which nothing in this repo overrides. At module scope no test timer
// covers it; inside a hook one would, and every run would fail on the clock.

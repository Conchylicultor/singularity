# markdown-apply

Applying an edited markdown document onto an existing block forest **without
re-minting block ids**, so every block keeps its content `Y.Doc` (and with it the
run tracker's history), its `page_links` edges, its `tasks_ext_prompt_block` link
and every entity-extension row keyed on block id. The editor's
`restorePageContent` is the other whole-page write (history restore), and it holds
the same contract: it matches the version's blocks to the page's BY ID and edits
the survivors' docs rather than replacing them. Both write text through the same
channel, `page/block-text-write`'s `writeBlockTexts`, after their structural
write. Design:
[`research/2026-08-03-page-markdown-apply-to-existing-forest.md`](../../../../research/2026-08-03-page-markdown-apply-to-existing-forest.md);
restore's:
[`research/2026-09-11-page-history-restore-preserves-block-identity.md`](../../../../research/2026-09-11-page-history-restore-preserves-block-identity.md).

## The root is the scope; the page is the transaction

`readBlockAsMarkdown(blockId, {redact})` / `applyMarkdownToBlock(blockId, md)`
take **any block**, not a page. A page id is simply the root at depth 0, so
`readPageAsMarkdown` / `applyMarkdownToPage` are the same call — they exist
separately only to *assert* their id is a page (the snapshot coming back is that
proof), so "this page" cannot silently mean "the page around this block".

> `rootId` bounds everything. `existing` is still the whole `page_id`
> partition — the rank floor and the sub-page pin need rows the walk may not
> reach — but survivors, updates and **`deleteIds` all derive from `oldRows`,
> the walk's output**. One line, no second filter to keep in sync.

The root itself is scope, not content: the walk starts at its CHILDREN, so it
has no line in the document and no write can name it.

- **`pageId` is a second required arg, never inferred from `rootId`.** A nested
  root cannot name its own page; created rows join a *partition*, not a position.
- **`subpage-removed`** — an absent shell is re-homed to `rootId` above the rank
  floor, which is right when the root IS the page and would drag a whole page
  tree INTO the addressed block when it is not. So under a nested root it
  refuses. Unreachable in practice (a scoped read emits every shell in scope),
  which is why it is loud.
- **`redact` filters the WALK and nothing else.** Pruning a row prunes its
  subtree for free; `existing` stays the whole partition, so a hidden row is
  invisible without being absent — it still reserves its rank against a
  collision, and still makes a `ref` naming it `ref-out-of-scope` rather than
  `unknown-ref`. Read and apply take the SAME-shaped option so one function
  serves both; redacting differently would diff against a document nobody saw.
  The engine never learns what a redaction *is*.
- The WRITE is still whole-page: `applyPageBlockPatch` locks the entire forest
  either way, because `(parent_id, rank)` is one ordering space.

## Two channels, because they have two owners

`planMarkdownApply` returns a `BlockPatch` **and** a separate `textEdits` list.
Structure is `page_blocks` rows under the page lock; text is the per-block
`Y.Doc`. The engine never mixes them:

> **A survivor's update never names `text`.** The `data` a survivor's update
> carries always restates the block's CURRENT projection verbatim (the same
> thing `preserveText` does for an editor conversion). A changed text leaves
> through `textEdits`.
>
> **A survivor's update never names `expanded`.** A parsed forest is uniformly
> `expanded: true`, so writing it would unfold every collapsed toggle, callout
> and sub-page on the page, on every apply.

Text for **newly created** blocks does ride `creates[].data.text` — legal and
required: a brand-new id has no doc, so its row is the seed.

The plan is a pure function of current state, so re-running an apply converges.
That is the recovery story for a write that fails between the two channels; do
not add a retry that assumes it saw the previous attempt.

## The page title is a READER-SIDE PREFIX, not a node (`core/page-title.ts`)

A PAGE-rooted read opens with `# <title>` — a string prepended AFTER the
serialize walk and stripped BEFORE the parse. The root stays scope, not content,
and the title handling adds **zero authority of its own**.

- **Emit and strip in ONE module**, for `flatten.ts`'s reason: disagree by a byte
  and the apply is a diff against a document nobody saw.
- **Only `rootId === pageId`.** A banner on a card-scoped read would come back as
  an `# H1` minted INSIDE the card.
- The title goes through the **same inline serializer** as every other line and
  its line terminators collapse to a space, so it cannot forge structure in the
  document the agent acts on.
- **The strip's only test is byte-identity** with the banner built from the
  page's CURRENT STORED title. A rename, a spliced-into banner and the page's own
  first heading are indistinguishable from here, so all of them fall through to
  the planner as a created heading and are refused. A deleted banner strips
  nothing and deletes nothing — it was never a row.
- **Known bound:** deleting ONLY the banner line, on a page whose first block is
  an H1 reading exactly the title, strips that H1 block instead. Telling the two
  apart needs the banner to be a node, which is what this refuses to make it.

`BlockScope` carries `title` because `loadBlockScope` is the only place it exists
without a second query — a page's own row is not in its content partition. It
carries the whole `pageRow` for the same reason: a policy walking a chain up past
the scope root needs to ask the page itself whose words it holds (an
agent-authored page is open all the way down), and `assertAcceptable` is handed it
beside the rows.

## Alignment: three passes, weakest evidence last

1. **LCS over identity keys** (`diffArrays`). This is why the engine exists in
   this shape. A page with five identical `- item` lines has five identical
   keys; the pages-history content bucket (`build-diff.ts`, the prior art)
   pops them in arbitrary order, so editing one re-pairs the lot. An LCS pairs
   them **by position**, the only answer available.
2. **Similarity within an alignment gap** — the anchors already assert that this
   region corresponds, so what is left there is an edit.
3. **Similarity across the whole document** — this is what lets a block that
   MOVED keep its id. A move is a removal in one gap and an insertion in
   *another*, which pass 2 can never pair.

**There is deliberately no similarity threshold.** Admission is the gate — same
type OR same plain text — and similarity only ranks. A normalized edit distance
punishes short text for being short (appending one word to `bravo` scores 0.38,
rewriting half a long paragraph scores 0.5), so any cut-off either drops the
commonest agent edit or admits everything anyway; and every pair a threshold
rejects becomes a delete plus a create, i.e. exactly the identity loss this
plugin exists to prevent. Stated bound: replacing a paragraph with an unrelated
one of the same type reads as an EDIT, so per-block metadata follows the
position rather than the words — the call every line-oriented diff makes.

## Asserted identity: pins

A node whose identity is **asserted** (a row id in the document) rather than
inferred (content similarity) is a `pin`, settled in its own pass after the three
content passes. Two sources, one mechanism, one refusal vocabulary:

- a **sub-page shell**, whose `<page id="…"/>` pointer is its only identity —
  or, for an agent-authored page, `<agent-page id="…" title="…"/>`, the
  identified SPELLING of the same `page` row type;
- an **identified card** — a tag declaring `markdown.tag.identified`, which
  round-trips its row id as the reserved `id` attribute. The type set is derived
  from the handle registry via `markdownTagIsIdentified` (any spelling counts —
  `page` is in it through `<agent-page>`), **never named here**.

A stored identified card is pinned even when the document does not name it —
otherwise a tagless `<agent-note>` written beside it shares its byte-identical
void content key and can absorb its row id (and its authorship) through an LCS
ambiguity.

Three refusals, resolved in this order: **`ref-duplicated`** (one row, two
positions), **`ref-out-of-scope`** (a real row the walk cannot reach — another
branch, or redacted; this is what stops a page-rooted edit dragging a hidden card
into scope and MOVING it), **`unknown-ref`**.

A `ref` that resolves must also be the SAME KIND of row as the node claiming it:
a card ref may not pin a page row (its children would be created under the page
with this page's `page_id`), nor a page pointer a card. A page pointer has two
more conditions, both because its content is not in this document:

- **canonical spelling** — the pointer's tag must be the one the stored row
  serializes to, so `<agent-page id="H"/>` naming a HUMAN's page is `unknown-ref`
  (and turning an agent page into a `<page>` link is refused the same way). Only
  the spelling is compared — it is chosen by the preset keys alone — so an edited
  or stale `title` on a pointer is ignored, as a read-only attribute is.
- **no body** — else `ref-out-of-scope`: the page's content lives in its own
  partition, and is written by passing its id as the root.

A matched shell is reposition-only, whichever spelling it came in under. `unknown-ref` gets no "already in
this document" hatch, unlike `<page>` below: an id on an identified tag is *only*
ever an identity claim, so a typo must never quietly become a create.

**There is no `note-removed` twin of `subpage-removed`, deliberately.** A shell
owns another partition the document cannot see, so an omission there destroys
invisible content; a card owns only lines the document shows, so omitting one is
an ordinary, fully-informed delete.

## Sub-pages are never deleted

A shell owns an entire other `page_id` partition. Its identity is its ROW ID,
which `<page id="…"/>` carries and no `data` field does — and the engine reads
that id back **by serializing the incoming pointer node and comparing the line**,
never by naming a block type or a `data` field. The tag is the contract; the
serializer is the only thing that knows how a type encodes its identity into one.
The comparison is id-only: the `title` a `<page>` line carries is an annotation,
and annotations never reach the planner. An agent-authored page's
`<agent-page id="…"/>` pointer pins through the identified-`ref` route above
instead, and is never deleted either.

- A shell **absent** from the incoming markdown is preserved, re-homed to the top
  level after everything the document did place (a rank floor above the highest
  placed rank; history restore re-homes a displaced sub-page the same way). It stays exactly put only when it already sits above that
  floor. Anywhere else it moves, because its own sibling list was re-ranked
  without it and the only interval provably free of a `(parent_id, rank)`
  collision is above the floor. Under a **nested root** this is
  `subpage-removed` instead — see *The root is the scope* above.
- A `<page id="…"/>` that is neither a live sub-page here nor a reference the
  document ALREADY holds is `unknown-ref`. That second half is not a softening:
  the same tag is how an ordinary link-to-page block serializes, so refusing
  every id that is not a sub-page would break every such block on every apply.
  What is refused is *inventing* a page reference, which a pure planner cannot
  verify. Repositioning a shell within its page is legal; naming it twice is
  `ref-duplicated`.

## Minting a page: `<agent-page title="…">body</agent-page>`

A `page` node WITHOUT a `ref` is a page this apply creates — the mint form of the
agent-authored page, the one way a markdown parse produces a page node at all
(`<page>` parses as a link; a human's sub-page is still only ever born through
`turn-into-page`). Research: `research/2026-09-11-page-agent-pages.md`.

- **Partition.** The new page row joins the apply's `pageId` (a page is displayed
  in its parent's partition); everything under it joins the NEW page's —
  `partitionOf(j)` is the nearest strict ancestor page node being created, else
  `pageId`. Nested mints work the same way.
- **Its body is asserted NEW.** Every node of a minted page is pinned to its own
  freshly minted id, so the aligner can never pair it with a stored row. Without
  that, a line in the new body reading like one already on this page would be
  paired by pass 3 and MOVED into the new page with this page's `page_id` — a row
  visible in neither. An identity claim inside a new body (an identified `ref`, a
  pointer at an existing page) is `ref-out-of-scope`: a row cannot move between
  pages. A survivor landing in a new partition is asserted impossible (a thrown
  programming error).
- **Born folded**, as `turn-into-page` folds a page: the one created row that does
  not carry the node's own `expanded`.
- Ranks, the rank floor, the preserved-shell logic and `subtractNoise` needed no
  change: the new body is its own sibling group under a new id, and a baseline
  document holds only pointers, which pin — so it plans no creates.
- `ApplyReport.createdPageIds` names the minted pages, so a caller can tell a page
  from its body. `applyPageBlockPatch` accepts exactly these two partitions (its
  closed-world guard) and announces each created page with its own
  `blocksChanged`.

## Ranks are minimal, per sibling list

Per parent, the longest strictly-increasing subsequence of the survivors' stored
ranks is **fixed** and keeps its rank byte-for-byte; only the complement is
minted, one `Rank.nBetween` per maximal run between fixed neighbours. Reordering
one paragraph costs one rank, not a rewritten sibling list. Where two
subsequences are equally long the choice is arbitrary — the tests assert the
COST (one write) and that applying the plan reproduces the asked-for document,
never which of two equally-minimal answers came out.

**A rank held by a row the walk could not reach is an OBSTACLE, at BOTH mint
sites** (`planSiblingRanks`' `reserved`, and the preserved-shell floor).
`Rank.nBetween` is deterministic, so the midpoint of `(A, B)` reproduces the key
of a hidden row inserted between A and B, byte for byte — the live unique index
then fails the whole apply, on the most ordinary edit there is. A survivor
*leaving* a sibling list is deliberately not an obstacle: its own update vacates
the key in the same transaction. Without `redact` the obstacle set is empty.

An obstacle only picks a run's FLOOR, which is the whole of the resulting
guarantee:

> **Stated bound, unconditional: blocks inserted where a hidden row sits land
> AFTER it, contiguously.**

Either side satisfies the author's intent equally — they could not see the row —
so the tie-break is decided by what else is at stake, and that is CONTIGUITY.
The movers are consecutive in the incoming document; interleaving them around
the obstacles would wedge a human's hidden card inside a sequence the agent
authored as a unit and break the authored order, while buying nothing: the
hidden row sits strictly between the same two visible survivors either way,
which is the only position it can be said to have.

## `StoredRow` is a local structural type

`page/editor`'s `StoredBlock` lives behind its SERVER barrel, which a `core`
module may not import. `core/stored-row.ts` declares the five columns this
engine reads; the server-side caller passes `StoredBlock[]` straight in and tsc
proves the two agree at that one call site.

## The acceptance predicate: what a write may DO (`core/touched.ts`)

`redact` decides what a write may **see**. `assertAcceptable` decides what it may
**do**. They are duals, and both are caller-supplied, so the engine still never
learns what an audience is: one takes rows and returns rows, the other takes a
plan and either returns or throws.

- `touchedBlocks(plan)` flattens the plan to four ids-by-channel lists;
  `boundaryViolations({plan, existing, rootId, boundaryOf, enclosure})` judges
  them against a caller-supplied ROW CLASSIFIER, handed `{id, type, data}` — a
  row may declare through its payload (an agent-authored page is a `page` row
  whose `data` says so), so the chain maps carry `dataOf`, overlaid by the data a
  plan writes. **No block type is named here** — naming one
  inverts `agent-access` → `markdown-apply` into a cycle. It returns violations
  rather than throwing (status and wording are the caller's), and throws for
  exactly one thing: a non-terminating ancestor chain, bounded by
  `existing.length + creates.length`, as `chainToPageRoot` does.
- **`boundaryOf` is THREE-VALUED, and nearest wins.** A row answers `"open"`
  (writes are allowed at and under it), `"closed"` (they are not), or `undefined`
  — it declares nothing and the walk passes through it. `nearestBoundary` stops at
  the first row that declares ANYTHING, not the first that says yes, which is the
  whole of the composition rule: a closed card inside an open one shields its
  contents, and an open card inside a closed one still admits writes. Two values
  could only ever say "allowed at and under this row", so a region the caller
  wants to shield INSIDE an allowed one would have no spelling at all.
- **`enclosure` is what the root sits inside**, required: a chain reaching
  `rootId` with nothing declared answers it. The engine cannot see above its root,
  so the caller resolves it (the policy walks the root's ancestry up through the
  page row) and a default would be a verdict with no evidence behind it.
- **A declaring row is inside itself**, in both directions. That is what lets a
  newly minted OPEN card satisfy its own check — otherwise minting a card is the
  one thing a boundary rule could never allow — and it is also why creating a
  CLOSED row is refused at its own row. So "nothing may mint a card whose words
  are not the writer's" is not a second invariant that can drift: it is this walk,
  with this evidence.
- **Both chains, not just the new one.** created → new, deleted → old,
  updated / text-edited → **BOTH**. A block whose new chain resolves open is not
  thereby legal: re-indenting the page's prose into a card is a MOVE, and since
  the aligner preserves the id of byte-identical text it arrives as an `update`
  naming `parentId` — so an after-only test lets an agent annex the whole page
  into its own card without deleting a character. The old chain resolves against
  PRE-plan maps, so moving a block's ancestor in the same plan cannot launder the
  block through it. The closed answer rides the same two chains and adds no rule:
  writing INSIDE a shielded region fails on the new side, carrying a block OUT of
  one fails on the old.
- **A violation carries the two facts separately**: `{blockId, how, side, reason}`,
  where `side` is `"new"` | `"old"` (which chain failed) and `reason` is
  `"escaped"` (the chain declared nothing) | `"enclosed"` (its nearest declaration
  was closed). One overloaded `reason` field used to carry both, which is why a
  delete's old-chain failure had to be special-cased back to the un-suffixed
  spelling; with `side` broken out, a delete simply has `side: "old"`. `judge`
  reports the new side first and RETURNS on its failure — a write that does not
  land legally is one answer, not two.
- **Field-level, not row-level.** Minting a card re-ranks its prose siblings, so
  `updates` names prose rows in the ORDINARY case: a rank-only (or
  `expanded`-only) update is exempt; `type`, `data`, `parentId`, `deleteIds` and
  text edits are judged. Without the carve-out the predicate refuses the feature.
- **`ApplyBlockOptions.assertAcceptable` runs once, synchronously, after planning
  and strictly before the first `applyPageBlockPatch`**, so a refusal has provably
  written nothing. It gets `{ rows, pageRow }`: the UNREDACTED partition — a
  chain walk needs ancestors the document never showed — and the page's own row
  from the same read, the top of every chain. Deliberately **no exported `plan`/`commit` pair**: a
  caller could commit a plan against rows it re-read, and no type can express
  "these two came from one read".

## An edit is judged on what IT changed (`core/subtract-noise.ts`)

A caller edits by splicing one string into the document a read gave it and
handing the WHOLE document back, so every other block round-trips through
markdown → forest — and wherever that projection is lossy, the loss arrives at
`assertAcceptable` as a write the caller never made. Measured on one real refused
edit: 12 boundary violations, none of them a content write. A policy then refuses
the caller over blocks it never touched, naming one of them and counting the
rest.

So `ApplyBlockOptions.baseline` takes the document the edit was made against.
`applyToScope` plans it through the SAME `planOf` — same rows, same `redact`,
same `MarkdownContext` — and `subtractNoise` drops every write the two plans make
identically. What is left is the edit.

- **Subtract, THEN judge, then write.** A policy must judge what will actually be
  written, and the `ApplyReport` counts the same thing, plus `absorbedWrites` so
  the subtraction is visible rather than silent.
- **`updates` / `deleteIds` / `textEdits` are comparable; `creates` are not.**
  The first three key off existing row ids and the planner is otherwise
  deterministic. Every pass mints fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` ids and a fresh
  `new Date()`, so two passes' creates have no equality to test — and a create in
  the baseline plan would mean the READ invented a block, which must be refused
  loudly rather than absorbed.
- **A baseline that does not plan against its own rows throws.** Nothing the
  caller does can cause that, so it is the engine's bug, not an occasion to
  degrade into an unsubtracted apply that then refuses the caller.
- **Only a caller that EDITED an engine-produced document may pass one.**
  `write_agent_note` composes its document from scratch and passes none: there is
  no round trip to subtract, and a wrong baseline would cancel real writes.

Design: [`research/2026-09-03-page-edit-judged-on-what-it-changed.md`](../../../../research/2026-09-03-page-edit-judged-on-what-it-changed.md).

## The write order (`server/internal/apply.ts`)

Structure first (one `applyPageBlockPatch` = one locked transaction), then the
plan's `textEdits` through `writeBlockTexts`
([`page/block-text-write`](../block-text-write/CLAUDE.md)) — the one
server-side text channel: every doc, then the `data.text` projections as one
patch. The doc-before-row order, why the projection is not optional, the seed
race, the character-level splice and decorator handling are all stated there.

## No MCP tools here: this plugin is the ENGINE

The agent-facing triple — `read_page`, `write_agent_note`, `edit_page` — lives in
[`page/annotations/agent-access`](../annotations/plugins/agent-access/CLAUDE.md),
which is the POLICY over this engine. (`edit_page` was once an export of this
plugin, then deleted; it came back over there under a contract that judges the
diff. That reversal is argued in the policy's own doc — the engine's shape is
unchanged either way.)

The split is not filing. A tool names a concrete block type, which a generic
engine must not, and the two predicates it hands in are POLICY, not projection:

> `redact` decides what a write may **SEE**. `assertAcceptable` decides what it
> may **DO**.

Both are caller-supplied, and neither teaches the engine what an audience is: one
takes rows and returns rows, the other takes a plan and either returns or throws.
So what is left here takes a root, a row filter and a boundary predicate, and a
second policy (export, share link) reuses it without adding a branch.

The end-to-end spec moved too — `agent-access/e2e/agent-access-verify.ts`.

**Agent-origin provenance does not apply, on purpose.** That hook reads
`x-singularity-origin` off an HTTP `Request` and marks whole PAGES an automated
session created, for a 24h sweep. An apply has no `Request`, and the page it can
mint — an agent-authored page — is written through `applyPageBlockPatch`, which
never fires `BlockLifecycle.AfterCreate`. That is load-bearing: the page is a real
document the user keeps, and synthesizing the header (or firing the hook) would
hand it to the sweep.

## `markdownNodesOfRows` and the plan share ONE traversal

The caller serializes with `markdownNodesOfRows` and diffs with the same
`core/flatten.ts` walk. If the two disagreed, the plan would be a diff against a
document nobody ever saw — which is why both live in one module over one
`childrenByParent` index, rather than each re-deriving "rank-ordered DFS from the
root". Both take `rootId`; a redaction must therefore be applied to the ROWS
handed to the walk, never to the emitted markdown.

## Annotations are read AFTER `redact`, and never reach the planner

A tag may declare `markdown.tag.annotated` attributes whose values live outside
the block's `data` (see `page/editor`'s CLAUDE.md). `serializeRoot` resolves them
with `resolveBlockAnnotations` over **the rows it was handed**, i.e. post-`redact`
— so a hidden card costs no provider query and its linked task can never surface
in a document that does not show the card. `markdownNodesOfRows(rows, rootId,
annotations)` stamps a node only where the map has an entry (no `annotations`
KEY otherwise, the structural-identity rule `ref` follows).

**The planner is deliberately untouched.** A void card's alignment key is
`type ␀ stableJson(data)` and an annotation is by definition not in `data`, so
dispatching an agent from a TODO changes what the card SAYS without changing what
it IS — the card keeps its row id and its rank through the next apply. An
annotation in the key would make every status change look like a new block.

// The PURE matching engine behind "apply this edited markdown onto that page".
//
// It answers one question — which stored block is which incoming node — and
// turns the answer into the smallest `BlockPatch` that realizes it, plus the
// text changes that must NOT ride that patch. No DB, no React, no I/O.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two invariants a survivor's update may never break
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  1. **A survivor's update never names `text`.** A block's text has exactly one
//     owner, its per-block `Y.Doc`; `page_blocks.data.text` is a debounced
//     PROJECTION of it. So a changed text leaves through `textEdits`, and the
//     `data` a survivor's update carries always restates the block's CURRENT
//     projection verbatim — the same thing `preserveText` does when the editor
//     converts a block's type. Writing the incoming text into the row instead
//     would make the row authoritative over the doc for as long as it took the
//     next projection flush to disagree.
//  2. **A survivor's update never names `expanded`.** A parsed forest is
//     uniformly `expanded: true` (a self-closing tag cannot distinguish
//     "collapsed" from "childless", and blocks are born expanded), so writing it
//     would silently unfold every collapsed toggle, callout and sub-page on the
//     page on every apply. Newly created rows carry the incoming node's own
//     `expanded`, which for a parsed forest is that same uniform `true`.
//
// Both are properties of the emitted patch, not of a downstream filter, and
// `plan.test.ts` asserts them directly over fuzzed edits.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Scope: the root bounds every authority the plan claims
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `rootId` is where the walk starts, and it is the ONLY thing bounding what this
// plan may touch. `existing` is deliberately the page's whole `page_id`
// partition (a rank floor, a sub-page pin and a `ref`'s "does this id name a row
// of this page at all" all need rows the walk may not reach), but `oldRows` —
// the walk's output — is what survivors, updates and `deleteIds` are all derived
// from, so a row outside the root's subtree can never be updated, moved or
// deleted however the document was edited.
//
// `redact` narrows the WALK and nothing else, which is why redaction needs no
// second rule anywhere downstream: a pruned row is not a survivor, not an
// update, not a delete — and, because it is still in `existing`, still holds a
// rank nothing may mint over and still answers a `ref` with `ref-out-of-scope`
// rather than `unknown-ref`.
//
// `pageId` is a SECOND, independent fact: which partition created rows join, and
// whether the root is the page itself. It is required rather than inferred
// because a nested root cannot tell you its page — and because the two differing
// is exactly what turns an absent sub-page shell from a re-home into a refusal.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Idempotence is the recovery story
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The plan is a pure function of the CURRENT stored state. Re-running an apply
// therefore converges: whatever already landed matches and emits nothing. That
// is what makes the two-channel write (structure atomically, then text per
// block) recoverable rather than corrupt if it fails half-way — and why nothing
// here may depend on having seen the previous attempt.

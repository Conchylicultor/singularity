// SELECTING A CONTAINER: covering its lines is how you point at the box.
//
// A void container renders no line of its own — its content IS its children —
// so there is nothing for a pointer to click. Its row is zero height while the
// children are visible, it carries no rail and no Shift+click target, and the
// editor's `rowAtPointer` skips it by an explicit height guard. Every pointer
// gesture therefore reaches the lines INSIDE the box and never the box.
//
// The rule that closes the hole (`withContainersSelected`, `page/editor`):
//
//   > A selection covering every line a container owns IS a selection of the
//   > container.
//
// The reported defect it fixes: "copy-pasting a /todo or /context block pastes
// only the inner content — the outer box disappears". Selecting the card's lines
// resolved to the CHILDREN, so the clipboard carried three paragraphs and the
// frame was never on it. The same hole let a drag carry the children out of a
// box the user thought they were moving.
//
// A sibling of `container-rail-verify.ts` (which control acts on which block)
// and of `container-collapse-verify.ts` (the fold). This one is about the
// SELECTION: what a range covering the box's lines resolves to.
//
//  1. A PARTLY COVERED BOX IS NOT SELECTED. Two of the card's three lines
//     highlight two lines. Asserted FIRST, because it is what keeps 2 and 3 from
//     passing for the trivial reason "an anchor is always swept in".
//  2. COVERING EVERY LINE SELECTS THE BOX. The highlight jumps to FOUR lines —
//     the container's zero-height anchor row plus its three children, i.e. the
//     frame's whole span — because the band paints a selected container over its
//     frame. That is the rule, visible.
//  3. COPY THEN PASTE ROUND-TRIPS A REAL CONTAINER. A second callout row appears
//     with three text children of its own. Asserted structurally against the
//     SERVER's rows (`parentId` / `type`), not against pixels: "the box came
//     with it" is a claim about the forest, and reading it back proves the paste
//     persisted rather than merely painted.
//
// The container under test is `callout`; the behaviour belongs to the container
// primitive and to the editor's selection, so `/todo` and `/context` inherit it
// unchanged.
//

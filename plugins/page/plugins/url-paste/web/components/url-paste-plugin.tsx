/**
 * Pasting a bare URL makes it a LINK, right away, and offers what else it could
 * be. A Plugin-only block-text extension (no inline node of its own — the link is
 * an ordinary `LinkNode`, i.e. a `TextRun.link` in the stored text).
 *
 * ## The gate
 *
 * A single bare http(s) URL (`readTransferText`, trimmed), in any text block:
 *
 * - **Paste** needs a COLLAPSED caret. A non-collapsed selection is declined,
 *   because `@lexical/link`'s `LinkPlugin` already wraps a selected range in the
 *   pasted URL, and that is the right outcome there.
 * - **Drop** keeps its old gate: an EMPTY block only. A drop into existing text
 *   has no caret we control — the browser picks the drop point.
 *
 * "Empty" reads the LIVE root text inside the handler, not `textOf(block)`: that
 * row copy trails the editor by up to ~1 s, so a block the user just cleared
 * would still read as full.
 *
 * ## The insert is its own undo step
 *
 * The handler cancels the gesture, then hands the insert to
 * `useBlockEditor().recordDocEdit(block.id, "Paste link", …)`. That runs it one
 * microtask later (the command handler is inside an `editor.update()`, where a
 * discrete update would only be enqueued), closes the open typing run first, and
 * records the paste as ONE undo entry. The insert places the caret AFTER the
 * link — `LinkNode.canInsertTextAfter()` is false, so typing continues outside
 * it. A caret in the middle of an existing link splits that link around the new
 * one (`insertNodes` splits inline parents up to the block), so links never nest.
 *
 * ## The menu, and when it goes away
 *
 * Right after the insert, the menu opens at the caret: Keep as link / Mention
 * (only with a server to ask for the title) / Create bookmark + Create embed
 * (only when the link is all the block holds). It closes on a pick, Esc, a click
 * outside, and — the rule everything else leans on — on ANY change to the
 * block's text after the insert: typing, Backspace, a remote edit, an undo. That
 * is an update listener comparing the root text with a snapshot taken right
 * after the insert.
 *
 * That rule is the whole Cmd+Z story. Cmd+Z reaches the surface undo stack like
 * any other; the paste was its own entry and the stack seals any open typing run
 * first, so the entry popped is the paste. Replaying it removes the link, the
 * text changes, and the menu closes. There is no key interception.
 *
 * Bookmark / Embed convert the block through `editor.convertTo` without
 * stripping the link from its text (Turn-into does the same to a non-empty
 * block): undoing the conversion brings the pasted link back, and a second undo
 * removes the paste.
 *
 * ## Mention
 *
 * Closes the menu and asks `bookmark`'s `/api/link-meta` for the page title.
 * Until it answers the link shows its URL, which is its true state. When the
 * title arrives, the link is re-found BY KEY and retitled as its own undo step
 * ("Mention link") — but only while it still exists with the same URL and the
 * URL as its text. Anything else means the user changed it meanwhile, and their
 * edit wins. A fetch failure or a page with no title is a toast; the URL stays.
 *
 * ## One surface for both gestures
 *
 * The two gestures ask the same question, so they share the insert and the
 * menu — a link dragged out of another tab is the same intent as one pasted from
 * it. The drop cannot collide with the container's own drop door: a single-line
 * URL over a block's editing host classifies as `inline` there, so the
 * container declines it, and this native listener on the contenteditable runs
 * before the container's React handler anyway (see the DROP arm for the one
 * payload where that is not enough).
 *
 * The menu is a full member of the caret-trigger primitive rather than a bespoke
 * surface. A paste is an EXTERNAL open signal — exactly what
 * `useForcedCaretQuery` (the same producer behind the gutter `+`) exists for — so
 * `useCaretMenu` supplies arrows / Enter / Esc / outside-press and the
 * pointerdown-timed `commit` identically to `/`, `[[`, `@` and `$$`.

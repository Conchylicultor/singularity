/**
 * Convert block `blockId` into a sub-page in place, titled `title`. The block
 * keeps its id and its position in the sibling ordering — it simply becomes the
 * `page` row, which the editor renders as an inline sub-page. Its descendants
 * follow (the server re-scopes their `page_id`).
 *
 * One atomic server op, shared by "Turn into → Page" and `/page`. There is no
 * separate `page-link` row: with inline sub-pages the page row IS the link.
 * (`page-link` survives as the *reference* block — a `[[ ]]` link to an
 * arbitrary page — which is semantically a different thing from an in-place
 * child.)
 *
 * `seedChild` is passed from here rather than chosen server-side because the
 * editor plugin must not import a concrete block type
 * (`@plugins/page/plugins/text`) — that would form an editor↔text cycle. This
 * plugin may depend on both, so it is the right place to combine them, exactly
 * as `createPageWithSeed` does for the sidebar's create paths.

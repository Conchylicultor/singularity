/**
 * Bring each named block of page `pageId` to its `runs` — the doc, then the
 * row's `data.text` projection. THE text channel for every server-side content
 * writer (markdown apply, history restore): call it AFTER the structural write
 * has committed, with every text-bearing block whose text that write means to
 * set.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Order: every doc before any row
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  1. **Docs**, per block, through {@link writeBlockText}: splice a stored doc
 *     to the target runs, or seed a missing one first-writer-wins. After the
 *     structure, never before: `page_block_docs.block_id` FKs onto
 *     `page_blocks.id`, so a block the structural write just created has no row
 *     to hang a doc off until it commits.
 *  2. **Rows**, in ONE `applyPageBlockPatch`: each update sets `data` to the
 *     row's CURRENT data with `text` replaced. `data.text` is a PROJECTION of
 *     the doc, so it is written downstream of it and never ahead: a failure in
 *     step 1 leaves every row as it was.
 *
 * **The projection is not optional.** The browser's `useTextProjection` needs a
 * MOUNTED editor, so a doc written for a page nobody has open would leave
 * `data.text` stale forever — and search, backlinks, version history and
 * `read-only-view` all read that column. This writes the value a mounted client
 * eventually would, so a later client flush is an empty diff rather than a
 * fight.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it costs, and what it skips
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every edited block's stored doc is loaded in ONE query (`loadBlockDocs`) and
 * its row in another, rather than one round trip per block — a history restore
 * names every text-bearing block of the page. Two skips then keep a large,
 * mostly-unchanged page cheap, and both are the same equality `writeBlockText`
 * already applies to a doc ({@link sameRuns}):
 *
 *  - **A block with NO stored doc whose row already reads the target runs is
 *    left completely alone** — no seed, no row write. Its row IS its seed: the
 *    first editor to open it seeds the doc from `data.text`, which already says
 *    the target. Seeding it here would mint a doc for every never-opened block
 *    of the page and change nothing anyone can read.
 *  - **A row that already reads the target is not rewritten**, whatever its
 *    doc needed. The projection's job is to make the row say the runs; a row
 *    that says them has nothing to write.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Failure: idempotence IS the recovery story
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Throws loudly, naming the block, and can leave some docs written and no row
 * projected. That is recoverable rather than corrupt because every step here is
 * a pure function of CURRENT state: a doc that already reads as the target is
 * untouched, a row that already reads it is untouched, so re-running the same
 * write converges. There is deliberately no retry loop and no compensating
 * rollback.
 *
 * A named block that is not a live block of `pageId` — deleted concurrently, or
 * never on this page — is refused loudly rather than skipped, before anything is
 * written when the read up front can see it, and before the projection when it
 * went between the two reads.

// buildPluginTree is a build-time primitive: a fully synchronous recursive
// readdirSync walk over hundreds of plugin dirs plus per-node facet extraction
// (several facets walk every .ts file in the repo). It blocks the event loop
// for tens of seconds. computePluginChanges only needs the two trees, so each
// side is memoized independently here on a cheap, ungated signature — an
// unchanged side is a pure cache hit that does zero work and takes no heavy
// slot. The signatureFn stays ungated; the computeFn owns withHeavyReadSlot, so
// hits skip the gate entirely (cf. commits-graph compute-graph.ts).

// MAIN tree: keyed by the (constant) mainPluginsDir → a single cache entry,
// shared across every conversation on this backend, with backend-wide
// single-flight. Signature = main's HEAD sha, so the main tree is rebuilt only
// when main actually advances — never on a worktree file save. When a main
// advance fans out via refHeadResource to N active reviews, they all coalesce
// onto ONE rebuild.

// worktree file save, so it is faithful and never stale: a stale tree would
// require a worktree file change that left every dirty file's mtime/size and the
// two SHAs untouched, which cannot happen.
//
// It replaces the edited-files watcher generation counter, which was not a
// fingerprint of git state at all (see
// research/2026-07-09-global-etag-value-coproduction.md). The content signature
// is strictly fresher — the counter only advanced after the watcher's 200ms/2s
// debounce — and a safe over-approximation in the other direction: a bare `main`
// advance now moves the merge-base and forces one worktree-tree rebuild that the
// counter would have hit. Correctness is unaffected either way; this memo is not
// skewed (pluginChangesResource is `mode: "push"` with no `revalidate`, so it has
// no ETag/value pair to keep in agreement) and it only needs a faithful, fresh
// signal.

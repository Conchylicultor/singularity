/**
 * Handler props that give any control the browser's own link gestures:
 *
 *   • plain click                 → open it HERE
 *   • ⌘/Ctrl-click, middle-click  → open it ELSEWHERE, staying put
 *
 * Build them with {@link linkProps} — "elsewhere" is a new browser tab at the
 * destination's URL, exactly what the same gesture does on an `<a href>`:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <IconButton icon={navIcons.expand} label="Expand pane" {...linkProps({ open: go, href: () => url })} />
 * ```
 *
 * **Why this is not free.** The browser grants these gestures to `<a href>`
 * only — an anchor pointing at a document. A `<button>` gets none of them, so
 * a control that navigates has to read them itself. Doing that once, here, is
 * what keeps every such control agreeing on what a ⌘-click means.
 *
 * `Ctrl` is honoured for Windows/Linux, where it is THE new-tab modifier. On
 * macOS it is inert by construction: Ctrl-click is the secondary click there,
 * so the OS raises a context menu and no `click` event is ever delivered.
 *
 * Shift is deliberately untouched. In a browser it means "new window", and
 * whether this app draws windows at all is the surface mode — a per-surface
 * user setting that a single link has no business overriding.

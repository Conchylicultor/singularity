/**
 * The page's two live regions, and the only thing this plugin renders.
 *
 * Both are permanently mounted, empty at boot. That is not incidental: a live
 * region has to be in the DOM *before* its text changes for assistive tech to
 * notice the change at all. Mounting a region together with its first message
 * is the classic reason "my aria-live never speaks" — the region and the text
 * arrive in the same commit, so there is no change to observe. Being at
 * `Core.Root`, these two are in the document from the app's first paint and
 * every later write is a change.
 *
 * `sr-only` is `position: absolute` with a 1px clip, so the host occupies no
 * space and perturbs no rect any layout, drag or measurement code reads.

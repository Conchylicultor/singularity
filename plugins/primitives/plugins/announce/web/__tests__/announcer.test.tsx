/**
 * The announcer's DOM contract: what `announce()` writes is what the live
 * regions hold, on the channel the caller asked for — and, the case the whole
 * design exists for, an identical message announced twice in a row produces two
 * *different* rendered strings, so assistive tech sees a change both times.
 *
 * Every test uses its own message text: the store is page-global by design (one
 * host, one speech queue) and therefore keeps its contents across tests, exactly
 * as it does across surfaces in the app. Distinct strings keep each case
 * independent of what ran before it, without the module needing a `reset` — the
 * same reasoning as the toast ledger's "no lifecycle hook clears it".

 * breakpoint — a window-width test deciding the layout of a 480px popover, so
 * it never fired where it was needed. Rather than teach the row a second width
 * axis, the column is gone: this is a single-user app (one instance per user),
 * so a chain of a checkout's own commits carries the same name on every row,
 * and the row's real content — the subject — is what that width was owed to.

// The SEND LANE: every write for one `(resource.key, paramsKey)` tuple departs
// in the order it was issued.
//
// This primitive's model is `data = pendingOps.reduce(apply, serverTruth)` — an
// ordered fold. A consumer whose ops do not commute needs the server to apply
// them in the order they were issued, or server truth diverges from the
// prediction. Ordering is load-bearing: structural ops depend on their
// predecessors' server-side effects (a second split targets the block the first
// one created), so a concurrent send can land out of order and be durably
// rejected for a row that is merely not committed YET.
//
// The registry is MODULE-LEVEL, not a per-hook ref: two mounted hooks on the
// same tuple are two writers to ONE server-side entity, and a per-instance chain
// would order each of them against itself only — which is exactly the hole the
// page editor's own `writeChainRef` had. Module scope is also what lets
// `enqueueResourceWrite` order a write for a tuple with NO mounted hook at all.

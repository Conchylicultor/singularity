// Pure overlay/replay logic for optimistic mutation. Lives apart from React so
// it can be unit-tested directly without a render. The hook
// (`use-optimistic-resource.ts`) is a thin React shell over these functions:
// the whole op lifecycle (dispatch → resolve/fail → confirm → deny/stall) is
// decided here, so the shell only owns state plumbing and the report emits.
//
// The governing policy (research/2026-07-11-global-never-revert-optimistic-edits.md):
// **pending local edits are never visually reverted.** An op leaves the overlay
// only for a CAUSAL reason that is LOCAL TO ITSELF — provably absorbed
// (confirmation) or provably superseded (a causally-later snapshot lacks its
// effect, Rule B). Failure is a sync-status state, not an undo; divergence
// without causal proof is a report, not an eviction.
//
// **The overlay is an ordered fold, so no op may be evicted on another op's
// evidence** (research/2026-09-01-global-overlay-ordered-fold-no-transitive-eviction.md).
// The rendered value is `pending.reduce(apply, serverTruth)`: removing a MIDDLE
// element changes the composition, so dropping B while an older A survives
// renders `A(base)` instead of `B(A(base))` — a state the user never created.
// That holds even with perfect evidence about B, which is why the old
// "cascade confirmation" (absorb every older same-target op when a newer one
// confirms) was deleted rather than better-evidenced. Its replacement is the
// ordering rule, enforced in `decideVerdicts`: **an op may not LEAVE the overlay
// while an older, still-surviving, same-target op is still in it.**

 *

 * - `confirmed` / `denied` / `denied-silent` ⇒ that op is LEAVING on this same

 *   saw its commit and lacks its effect, so the base is past it, not stale with

 * order, so the waits-for graph is a total order restricted to same-target
 * pairs — a DAG; no cycle is spellable. The oldest op on each target has
 * nothing older, so it is decided exactly as it would be without this rule;

 *
 * Order of the checks per op:
 *
 * 1. **Blocked first.** An op an older same-target survivor sits ahead of is
 *    not evaluated at all this pass. This gates EVERY exit route — content,
 *    exact ack, coarse, and denial alike. Gating only content would leave the
 *    fold hole open through the ack door: A deletes X, B recreates it, the net
 *    recompute produces no value change, so a standalone ack frame confirms B
 *    exactly while the cached pre-A snapshot still shows X — drop B, replay A,
 *    and X vanishes from the user's screen.
 * 2. **Unresolved ⇒ `pending`.** Failed ops are unresolved by construction
 *    (their `mutate` rejected), so confirmation, denial and miss counting are
 *    all structurally unable to touch them: they keep replaying, which IS the
 *    never-revert policy. Note they also BLOCK newer same-target ops (via the
 *    check above) — dropping a newer op while an unresolved older one is still
 *    in the fold breaks the composition exactly the same way a resolved one
 *    does; whether the older op's request is in flight has no bearing on where
 *    it sits in the fold.
 *
 *    **Consequence, stated so it is never rediscovered as a surprise:** a
 *    FAILED op parks its same-target juniors in the overlay for as long as it
 *    stays failed. A `network` failure self-heals — the next reconnect edge
 *    auto-retries it — but an `http` failure is a durable verdict that waits
 *    for the user's explicit `retry()`, so its juniors can sit there
 *    indefinitely. That is the safe direction and the whole point: those
 *    juniors keep RENDERING (the fold stays intact), they accrue no misses
 *    while blocked, and the surface is already reporting `error` because of the
 *    failed op — the cost is deferred overlay occupancy, never a reverted edit.
 * 3. Otherwise the edge's own `evaluate` closure decides.
 *
 * `sameTarget` is absent in coarse mode (the consumer declared no op identity),
 * so there is nothing to block on and every op is evaluated — coarse has always

 * The ACK edge: a standalone `{ kind: "ack" }` frame (or any ack note) landed

 * change acknowledged one or more commits. Drops every RESOLVED op whose ack
 * token the registry now remembers, and NOTHING else: no miss is counted (no
 * new snapshot arrived — a non-ack carries no evidence) and no denial ever runs
 * (`ackTx` can only confirm). Returns the input `pending` BY IDENTITY when
 * nothing changed, so the React shell skips the state write.
 *
 * The ordering rule gates this edge too, and this is the edge that most needs
 * it: a standalone ack frame is emitted precisely when the recompute produced
 * NO value change — e.g. A deletes X and B recreates it — so the cached
 * snapshot beside it still shows the pre-A world. Confirming B out of turn
 * there would drop B, replay A alone, and make X vanish.

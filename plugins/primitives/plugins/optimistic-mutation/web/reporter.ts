 *   watermark comparison, Rule B) still didn't reflect it: a newer server write
 *   overwrote its effect. The op was DROPPED from the overlay — the healthy
 *   newer-truth outcome, reported for observability.
 * - `"stalled"` — `DIVERGENCE_REPORT_MISSES` consecutive authoritative
 *   snapshots failed to reflect a server-acked op that carries no causal proof
 *   of supersession. The op is KEPT (never-revert) and keeps replaying; this
 *   one-shot report is the investigation signal for a wrong
 *   `apply`/`isConfirmedBy` pair.
 *
 * Carries only bounded, serializable coordinates — never the raw `vars`
 * (unbounded, possibly unserializable); `opSummaries` is the consumer's own
 * `describeOp(vars)` rendering.

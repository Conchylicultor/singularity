# optimistic-mutation

Reusable optimistic-mutation primitive layered on top of `live-state`. It gives
any `useResource`-backed surface immediate, snap-free optimistic updates that
reconcile cleanly with the authoritative WebSocket push.

## Model: overlay / replay — and never-revert

Pending local mutations live **outside** the TanStack cache, in React state
colocated with the consumer. The rendered value is always

```
data = pendingOps.reduce(apply, serverTruth)
```

so when a WS push overwrites the cache key, `data` simply recomputes — replaying
the still-pending ops on the fresh base. No push can clobber the prediction,
because the prediction was never written into the cache. Never `setQueryData` a
prediction: live-state's push overwrites the whole key, version-gated and
uncorrelated with any client op, so a cache-write prediction would race exactly
like waiting for the refetch does.

The governing policy
(`research/2026-07-11-global-never-revert-optimistic-edits.md`, matching
Docs/Figma/Linear/Notion local-first semantics): **pending local edits are never
visually reverted.** An op leaves the overlay only for a *causal* reason **local
to itself** — provably absorbed (its own `isConfirmedBy` accepts the snapshot, or
an exact ack names its own commit) or provably superseded (a snapshot causally
past its commit lacks its effect). One op's evidence never speaks for another,
and no op leaves out of turn: see *The ordering rule* below. A failed
`mutate` is a sync-status state (the cloud icon), never an undo; a
non-confirming push is at worst a *report*, never an eviction. The CRDT text
lane (`page/editor`'s `live-state-yjs-provider.ts` — offline is `syncing`, bytes
buffer and retry push-based) implements the same policy for text; this primitive
is the structural lane's twin.

## Ops are an ordered fold, so their writes are an ordered stream

The rendered value is `pendingOps.reduce(apply, serverTruth)` — an **ordered
fold**. A consumer whose ops do not commute therefore needs the server to apply
them in the order they were issued, or server truth diverges from the prediction
and the op can never confirm. That is a property of THIS primitive, not of any
consumer.

The primitive already asserted it, on its failed-op retry drain:

> Ordering is load-bearing: structural ops depend on their predecessors'
> server-side effects (a second split targets the block the first one created),
> so a concurrent replay can land out of order and be durably rejected for a row
> that is merely not committed YET.

…and enforced it there while leaving **first dispatch** racing. Dispatch, `retry`
and the reconnect drain are now ONE mechanism: the **send lane**
(`web/internal/send-lane.ts`).

- **Per `(resource.key, paramsKey)`, module-level** — NOT a per-hook ref: two
  mounts on one tuple are two writers to one server-side entity, and a
  per-instance chain orders each only against itself. Key is canonical sorted-key
  JSON, so mounts that build `params` differently still share it.
- **Failure-proof.** It advances on settle, resolve *or* reject, so a durably
  rejected op cannot wedge its successors — while each send still returns its own
  true outcome, leaving classification / `failed` / `retry` / `savedAt` untouched.
- **An idle lane sends synchronously, then is reclaimed** — no latency and no
  microtask of skew when nothing precedes; and a lane with nothing unsettled
  constrains nothing, so the registry can't grow per tuple ever written.
- **Only the send is on it.** Overlay, React commits and both confirmation edges
  are off it: `confirmPass` fires from the QueryCache subscription at any time.
- **A write with no overlay can still join it**: `enqueueResourceWrite(resource,
  params, fn)` puts a plain thunk on a tuple's lane. It exists because the
  registry is module-level — a tuple with NO mounted hook still has a lane — so a
  write whose surface is unmounted, or whose effect no single tuple's overlay can
  predict, is *unordered* rather than merely unpredicted if it bypasses this.
  Ordering holds; there is nothing to predict. (Consumer: the page editor's
  detached undo/redo persist into a collapsed sub-page, and its cross-page drag.)
- **Head-of-line blocking is real and deliberately invisible**: a slow write
  delays its successors' *wire* departure, but the overlay rendered them instantly
  (never-revert). If it ever matters, batch at the consumer's endpoint (one
  request folding N ops in order) — do NOT weaken the lane.
- **The drain's `await` loop is gone; its early-stop is not.** The failed batch is
  enqueued synchronously in overlay order (an await-loop would let a write
  dispatched mid-drain slot between two older ops it depends on); a `network`
  outcome makes the remaining slots skip, keeping their `failure` so the next
  reconnect edge re-drains from the top.

Motivating incident (page editor): a `split` reaching the server before the
`convertTo` it depended on, so the user's bullet silently reverted one push later
— latent until the caret authority started replaying keystrokes with no pauses.

## Three signals, not one

The pending list answers three different questions; conflating them pins the
sync-status cloud on "Saving…" forever:

| question | signal |
|---|---|
| Has the server acked my write? | `saving` — is any op still **unresolved**? |
| Can I stop predicting this op? | *confirmation* — drop it from the overlay |
| Does the server durably disagree? | *divergence* — a report, not a UI state |

`pendingOps` is the **replay set**: it still contains server-acked ops whose
confirming push hasn't been matched yet, and failed ops awaiting a retry. It is
NOT "is anything unsaved" — read `saving` for that.

## API

```ts
const { data, serverData, pending, dispatch, pendingOps, saving, failed, retry } = useOptimisticResource({
  resource,            // ResourceDescriptor<Data, P> from live-state
  params,              // optional resource params
  apply,               // (current: Data, vars: Vars) => Data — PURE predicted next state
  mutate,              // (vars: Vars) => Promise<void | { watermark?: string }> — the network call
  // Content-based confirmation is an all-or-nothing PAIR (omit both for coarse):
  isConfirmedBy,       // (serverData, vars) => boolean — content-based confirmation
  sameTarget,          // (a, b) => boolean — op identity; REQUIRED with isConfirmedBy (the ordering rule)
  onError,             // optional (err, vars) => void
  label,               // optional string — names the thing being saved (sync-status error state)
  describeOp,          // optional (vars) => string — bounded op summary for the divergence report
});
```

- `dispatch(vars)` mints an `opId`, appends `{opId, vars, resolved:false,
  dispatchGen, misses:0, divergenceReported:false}` to the ordered pending list,
  and fires `mutate(vars)`. `dispatchGen` is the cache generation
  (`dataUpdateCount`) at dispatch — tokenless coarse confirmation compares
  against it. On resolve the op is marked `resolved`, stamped with the endpoint's
  `ackWatermark` (when returned), cleared of any prior failure, **and immediately
  re-checked for confirmation**. On reject it **stays in the overlay**
  (never-revert) with a classified `failure` — see the failure model below.
- **Ack watermarks (Rule A) and snapshot watermarks (Rule B).** A mutation
  endpoint may return `{ watermark }` — `currentTxId(tx)` (`database/server`)
  read *inside its write transaction* (free; the write already assigned the xid).
  Which live-state frames carry a snapshot watermark (Rule B′), and why
  comparison must go through `compareTxWatermark`, are owned by
  `live-state/CLAUDE.md` ("Commit watermarks"). The one sound inference here:
  `cmp(snapshotWm, ackWm) > 0` (strict) ⇒ that snapshot provably saw the op's
  commit (or its overwrite). Equal or older proves nothing — the snapshot may
  predate the commit no matter how many pushes delivered it; delivery order is
  not causality.
- `failed` is the list of `{opId, vars}` whose `mutate` was **durably rejected
  by the server** (an `EndpointError` — HTTP status). Network-level failures are
  deliberately NOT in it (they auto-retry — see the failure model).
  `retry(opId)` re-fires the op **in place**: same opId, same overlay position,
  so the rendered prediction never moves or flickers (it clears the failure and
  re-runs `mutate`; there is no remove + re-dispatch). Consequence: a retried op
  sits **earlier** in the pending order than ops that committed before it, so
  overlay position is NOT commit order. Nothing may infer "older in the list ⇒
  committed first" — the ordering rule doesn't; it only makes the retried op
  block its same-target juniors until it settles, which is correct either way.
- `serverData` is the raw authoritative overlay base — server truth with NO
  pending ops applied (`resource.initialData` until the first push). For
  consumers that must distinguish "the server has really absorbed this row" from
  the prediction — e.g. the page editor gates a block's content-doc seed (an
  FK-dependent write) on the block id appearing here, never in overlaid `data`.
- **Forced sync-status reporting:** the hook calls `useReportSync` internally
  (`@plugins/primitives/plugins/sync-status/web`) with
  `phase = failed.length ? "error" : saving ? "syncing" : "idle"`, the `label`, a
  `retry` that re-runs **only this hook's own** failed ops, and an explicit
  `savedAt` timestamp. A network-failed op is unresolved, so it reports as
  `syncing` (offline-is-syncing — the Yjs lane's policy), never `error`; only a
  durable HTTP rejection is an `error`. `savedAt` is stamped (`Date.now()`)
  **inside the resolve handler**, from `resolvePass`'s result, the moment no
  unresolved op remains — NOT from an effect watching a derived boolean, which
  React can coalesce away within one render (the hazard `sync-status/CLAUDE.md`
  documents). Outside a `<SyncStatusProvider>` the report is a no-op.
- **Exact-ack confirmation (`ackTx`).** Feed-driven frames carry `ackTx` — the
  source-transaction ids the recompute folded in — and `ackChannel`-opted
  resources additionally broadcast standalone `{ kind: "ack" }` frames for
  no-value-change recomputes (frame production + the narrow claim are owned by
  `resource-runtime/CLAUDE.md`). The client notes them into a module-level tx-ack
  registry (`hasResourceTxAck` / `subscribeResourceTxAcks` from `live-state/web`,
  namespaced per `(key, paramsKey)`, 256-entry ring). Consumption here: a registry
  hit on an op's `ackWatermark` proves *that commit's rows were re-read
  post-commit for this tuple* — so it CONFIRMS the op exactly, on all three edges
  (push, resolve, and the ack edge's `ackPass`), and can NEVER deny; denial stays
  snapshot-watermark-only
  (Rule B). This keeps confirmation exact once scoped/point deltas stop shipping
  snapshot watermarks; a lost ack degrades safely to the Rule B backstop on the
  next full frame / resub. See
  `research/2026-07-18-global-bounded-working-set-phase2.md` Part C (C4).
- **Confirmation runs on TWO edges**, because the confirming push routinely
  arrives *before* the mutation's own HTTP response:
  - **The push edge** (`confirmPass`) — the QueryCache subscription on
    `queryKeyFor(key, params)`. Resolved ops are dropped: content-based when
    `isConfirmedBy(serverData, vars)` accepts the snapshot; coarse-with-token
    when the snapshot watermark is strictly past the op's `ackWatermark` (exact
    causal confirmation); tokenless coarse on any post-resolve push (legacy).
    The registry watermark is read synchronously inside the cache callback — it
    was written immediately before the `setQueryData` that fired it, so it is the
    causal floor of exactly the snapshot being examined.
  - **The resolve edge** (`resolvePass`) — `mutate` came back 2xx: mark the op
    resolved, stamp its ack token, then confirm it *immediately* against what the
    cache already holds. Content-based re-runs `isConfirmedBy`; coarse-with-token
    asks the registry watermark; tokenless coarse asks `gen > op.dispatchGen`.

  Without the resolve edge, an op that resolves one millisecond *after* its
  confirming push is stranded in the overlay **forever** (`confirmPass` saw it
  unresolved and kept it; no further push for that key is coming) — and that
  ordering is structurally biased, not a coin flip: the L4 DB change-feed pushes
  at transaction commit while the HTTP response still has the handler's
  post-commit tail (re-SELECT, parse, serialize) to write. A stranded op keeps
  `saving` true forever and stays in the replay fold, ready to resurrect a row
  another writer later deletes.

  **Only an authoritative snapshot may confirm.** Both edges are gated on one, and
  neither `resource.initialData` nor "the cache emitted an event" qualifies:
  - The QueryCache emits `"updated"` for **every** query action (`fetch`,
    `error`, `invalidate`, `setState`), none of which touch `state.data`. Only
    `success` bumps `dataUpdateCount`, so the push edge ignores any event that
    doesn't increase it — ungated, a bare `invalidateQueries` would coarse-confirm
    every resolved op and charge each a divergence miss for a snapshot that never
    arrived.
  - Before the first push, `state.data` is `resource.initialData` (a placeholder,
    `dataUpdatedAt === 0`). The resolve edge passes `undefined` rather than the
    placeholder, because `isConfirmedBy` would accept it (an empty base vacuously
    "reflects" a remove, and `isPatchReflected` treats an update naming
    a missing row as absorbed), dropping the op against data never sent.

  **Tokenless-coarse soundness.** `gen > dispatchGen` proves *a* push landed
  after dispatch, not that it carries our commit. In the rare bad ordering (a
  push generated pre-commit, delivered post-dispatch) the op drops early and the
  UI briefly reverts until the real push lands — which is *guaranteed*, since the
  write committed. Bounded and self-healing, never a permanent zombie; returning
  `{ watermark }` from `mutate` removes even that window.
- **Failure model (never-revert).** A rejected `mutate` keeps the op in the
  overlay — the prediction stays rendered. The rejection is classified once:
  - **`network`** (`fetch` rejected — no HTTP verdict: offline, gateway down,
    server restarting): nothing is known to be wrong with the op. It stays
    `syncing` (not in `failed`) and **auto-retries in place, push-based** on
    either reconnect edge — the live-state socket for this resource's origin
    reopening (`subscribeWsStatus` + `liveStateSocketKind`), or the browser's
    `online` event. No timers, no per-push retry; the residue (fetch fails while
    the WS never cycled and the browser never went offline) waits for the next
    edge or a manual `retry`, same as the Yjs lane.
  - **`http`** (`EndpointError` — the server answered and said no): a durable
    verdict. The op surfaces in `failed`, phase `error`, and waits for an
    explicit `retry` — reconnect edges deliberately do NOT re-fire it (the
    server would just repeat the verdict). `onError` fires on every rejection.

  A failed op is **unresolved**, and unresolved ops are untouchable by
  confirmation, denial, and miss counting alike — it just keeps replaying, which
  is exactly the never-revert guarantee.

  **It also parks its juniors.** Unresolved means it survives every pass, so the
  ordering rule holds every newer same-target op in the overlay behind it: a
  `network` failure until a reconnect edge auto-retries it, an `http` failure
  until the user clicks Retry. That is intended — the fold stays intact, so the
  juniors keep rendering correctly and accrue no misses, and the surface is
  already in `error` for the failed op anyway. It is still a behaviour change
  worth knowing: before the ordering rule those juniors could confirm and leave
  ahead of a write that had not landed.
- **Divergence: denial vs report-only.** There is deliberately no miss-limit
  eviction: under push lag its "misses" are stale snapshots computed before the
  commit, so dropping the op reverts the user's edit. What exists instead:
  - **Causal denial** (content mode only — the ONE eviction there is): a
    resolved, unconfirmed, unblocked op carrying an `ackWatermark` is
    dropped when the snapshot watermark is *strictly* past it yet
    `isConfirmedBy` still rejects the snapshot — the snapshot provably saw the
    commit, so the effect was overwritten by newer server truth. Rendering that
    is showing newer truth, not reverting. Reported via the sink with
    `kind: "superseded"`. Coarse mode never denies (no `isConfirmedBy` to attest
    "the snapshot lacks my effect" — a causally-later snapshot can only
    confirm); tokenless ops are never denied (no causal proof exists).
  - **The stalled report** (`DIVERGENCE_REPORT_MISSES = 3`): a resolved op that
    survives that many consecutive authoritative snapshots files ONE report
    (`kind: "stalled"`, latched via `divergenceReported`) and **stays in the
    overlay**, still confirmable by any later matching snapshot. It is the
    investigation signal for a wrong `apply`/`isConfirmedBy` pair — or plain
    push lag, which self-heals. A **blocked** op counts no miss: a miss means
    "a fresh snapshot arrived and still didn't reflect the op", and a pass we
    declined to evaluate is information-free — counting it would file a
    `stalled` report about a verdict never formed. The front of each same-target
    chain is never blocked, so the signal survives. The resolve edge counts no
    miss and never denies — no new snapshot arrived, so a non-confirmation
    carries no evidence.
  - **Self-supersession files no report.** A denial whose op has a newer
    same-target op confirmed in the *same* pass is the client overwriting its
    own write (undo→redo), not a lost race: the drop still happens, the
    `superseded` report is suppressed. Misclassification costs a mis-filed
    report and never a lost edit, which is where a heuristic belongs.
- **`optimisticDivergenceReportSink`** (`web/reporter.ts`) is the sanctioned sink
  inversion, mirroring `error-boundary`'s `boundaryReportSink`: this primitive
  must not import `reports`, so `reports/plugins/optimistic-divergence` registers
  the handler at mount and files the report. The payload
  (`{ kind, resourceKey, params, label, misses, opSummaries }`) carries no raw
  `vars` — unbounded and possibly unserializable; `opSummaries` comes from the
  optional `describeOp(vars)` arg (empty if omitted), which must be pure and
  total — it runs on the reconcile path. `emit` never throws.
- **The ordering rule** (content-based mode — this plugin owns it; `page/editor`
  defers here): `sameTarget` is **required** alongside `isConfirmedBy` — the two
  are a paired, all-or-nothing arm of a discriminated union, and each half alone
  is unrepresentable (pinned at type level by `web/internal/args-types.test.ts`).
  The rule:

  > An op may not **leave** the overlay while an older, still-pending,
  > same-target op survives this pass.

  It applies **only in content mode**: `decideVerdicts` blocks nothing without a
  `sameTarget`, so coarse consumers get no ordering rule. Correct, not an
  oversight — with no identity relation you cannot know which ops interact, and
  coarse mode's exits are confirmation-only (it never denies).

  Why it must exist: the rendered value is `pendingOps.reduce(apply, serverTruth)`,
  an ordered fold. Removing a *middle* element changes the composition — drop B
  while A remains and the user sees `A(base)` instead of `B(A(base))`, a state
  they never created. This holds even with perfect evidence about B, so no
  amount of proof licenses an out-of-turn departure. (The predecessor rule,
  same-target *cascade*, did the opposite — a confirmed newer op evicted older
  same-target ops — and shipped an incident where a live block vanished for ~90s:
  `research/2026-09-01-global-overlay-ordered-fold-no-transitive-eviction.md`.)

  - **Gates every exit route** — content confirmation, exact `hasAck`, coarse,
    and denial. Gating only content leaves the hole open through the ack door: A
    deletes X, B recreates it, the net recompute changes no value, so a
    standalone `{kind:"ack"}` frame confirms B *exactly* while the cached pre-A
    snapshot still shows X; drop B, replay A, X vanishes.
  - **A denied older op does not block** — the snapshot provably lacks its
    effect, so the base is past it, not stale with respect to it. A just-confirmed
    older op doesn't block either: it is leaving in this same pass.
  - **Evicts nothing.** A wrong answer costs a deferred confirmation, never a
    reverted edit — which is also why `sameTarget` may stay an intersection test:
    over-matching only defers.
  - **Liveness.** Blocking runs strictly older→newer over array order, so the
    waits-for graph is a total order restricted to same-target pairs — a DAG, no
    cycle spellable. The oldest op on a target is never blocked, so it is decided
    exactly as before; when it leaves, its successor becomes the front. Every
    chain drains from the front.
  - **Coverage is exactly as good as `sameTarget` is accurate.** An
    under-approximating relation means less *blocking*, so two ops that really do
    interact in the fold may not register as same-target and one can leave early.
    Accepted residue; the fix is at a better rung — make `sameTarget` name the
    rows an op really writes.

  It closes the stuck-inverse-pair hazard the cascade existed for (undo "delete
  X", redo "restore X" dispatched before the deletion's push: every later
  snapshot shows X present, confirming the redo and never the undo) by making the
  redo *wait* instead of evicting the undo. Both replay, X renders present, and
  the pair drains as soon as any watermark-carrying frame denies the undo.
  Content-mode consumer: the page editor (`sameOverlayTarget` — block-id-set
  intersection over ops/patches, `web/block-store.ts`). The conversation queue is
  the coarse-mode consumer and supplies neither half.
- `apply` must be pure. For the "this op no longer applies to the current base"
  case (e.g. the server already absorbed it and the row it referenced is gone),
  throw `OpNoLongerApplies` (exported from the barrel) — the replay drops just
  that op and keeps the rest. Any OTHER throw is treated as a reducer bug and
  propagates loudly (fail loudly — never silence), rather than vanishing into a
  self-healing push.
- Op insertion order is preserved, so fast chained ops compose deterministically.

## Two rejected fixes, so they aren't re-proposed

- **A causal floor on content confirmation** (reject a confirmation when
  `W < op.ackWatermark`). Not unsound — but it **wedges under the exact load it
  exists to survive**. `xmin` is the lowest still-running xid, so one long
  transaction pins it low cluster-wide, and `SOURCE_TX_CAP = 64` makes the
  runtime suppress the *entire* `sourceTx` set on overflow — killing `hasAck`
  too. Both confirmation routes die at once, the overlay grows at the user's
  edit rate for the whole episode, and replay goes quadratic. It also
  contradicts `live-state/CLAUDE.md` ("an absent watermark means *no causal
  floor*: confirming by content is fine, denial is forbidden").
- **Absorbing through the ack door** instead of blocking (when B is
  ack-confirmed and orders after A, drop A with it). Deferred, not unsound in
  principle — but it needs a **subset** relation, not `sameTarget`'s
  intersection, or it discards A's effect on rows B never wrote. The
  fail-closed `coversOverlayTarget` sketch (only a patch may be absorbed, since
  only a patch's target set is exact) is in the research doc. It only shortens a
  wait the rule already renders correctly through, so revisit it only if
  deferral measurably fails.

## Where the logic lives

The **whole op lifecycle** is a pure state machine in `web/internal/overlay.ts`.
Deciding and partitioning are split, because the blocking test needs each op's
**final** fate — denial included — before any newer op consults it:

- `decideVerdicts` — one forward loop, oldest first, assigning each op
  `confirmed | denied | denied-silent | unconfirmed | pending | blocked`. The
  first three drop; the last three keep, and only `unconfirmed` costs a miss.
  `pending` is an unresolved op (in flight, or `mutate` rejected) — nothing is
  known to be wrong with it, so it keeps AND **blocks**: it is a survivor of the
  pass. Because the loop runs oldest-first, an op's fate is fixed before its
  juniors read it.
- `reconcile` — a pure partition of that verdict array plus the miss/latch
  bookkeeping. It holds no `sameTarget` and no watermark; all the deciding is in
  the loop above.

`ReconcileResult` gains no arm for the two silent verdicts: `dropped` *is* the
report channel, so `confirmed` and `denied-silent` are simply absent from it.
Around them sit `replay`, the three edges `confirmPass` / `resolvePass` /
`ackPass`, and `markResolved` / `markFailed` / `clearFailure`. Every edge returns
the input `pending` array **by identity** when nothing changed, so the React shell
skips the state write. Unit-tested in `overlay.test.ts` (`bun test`) — where new
lifecycle coverage belongs.

The hook (`web/internal/use-optimistic-resource.ts`) is a thin shell: the
`pending` state (mirrored in a commit-time ref, because a functional `setState`
updater cannot yield the report lists without becoming effectful), the cache
subscription, the reconnect auto-retry subscription, the `savedAt` stamp, and the
sink emits. Its wiring — `dataUpdateCount` stamp, push-before-resolve ordering,
keep-rendered failures, `online` auto-retry, registry-watermark denial, send-lane
ordering — is pinned by `web/__tests__/use-optimistic-resource.test.tsx`
(`bun run test:dom plugins/primitives/plugins/optimistic-mutation`).

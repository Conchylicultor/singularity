/**
 * The sanctioned home for a **surface-filling** overlay: a box that covers the
 * app tab's whole surface — everything below the tab bar and right of the app
 * rail — while the app chrome around it stays visible and usable.
 *
 * Why a portal at all. The caller is somewhere down a pane tree: a Miller
 * column, a scroll body, a card. `absolute inset-0` there fills that column,
 * not the surface, and no combination of classes at the call site can reach
 * past an ancestor that is `overflow-hidden` or `relative`. So the overlay is
 * rendered into the nearest `<SurfaceOverlayHost>` instead, which is the only
 * box that IS the surface.
 *
 * How it differs from its two neighbours:
 *
 * - `<ViewportOverlay>` fills the WINDOW (portals to `document.body`), so it
 *   covers the rail and the tab bar too. That is right for a modal scrim or a
 *   fullscreen mode and wrong whenever the user must keep switching tabs.
 * - `<Layer>` / `<Overlay>` fill their own PARENT and cannot escape it — they
 *   are in-flow positioning, with no portal. Right when the box you want to
 *   cover is the box you are already in.
 *
 * The container is minted once and never replaced. React reconciles a portal by
 * container identity, so a container that changes (or a portal put behind a
 * condition) deletes the subtree and builds a new one — an `<iframe>` inside
 * would reload, an uncommitted edit would be gone. The same idiom, and the same
 * reason, as `primitives/adaptive-bar`'s `PortaledBarItem`; the co-located
 * `no-portal-toggle` rule bans the conditional shape.
 *
 * A missing host throws. There is no viewport fallback and no silent no-op:
 * "covers the surface" and "covers the window" are different pictures, and a
 * primitive that quietly delivers the second one when the first is unavailable
 * is a bug that only shows up in a screenshot.

 *
 * Taking the whole `caret` handle rather than loose `query` / `onDismiss` props
 * means a host cannot wire a different trigger's dismissal into this surface.
 *
 * `data-caret-trigger` makes the arbiter's at-most-one-owner invariant
 * observable from the DOM (`e2e/caret-trigger-wedge.ts` asserts on it); the
 * `contents` wrapper takes no box, so it cannot perturb the surface's layout.

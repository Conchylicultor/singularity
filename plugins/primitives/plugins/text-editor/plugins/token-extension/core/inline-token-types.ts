/**
 * THE declaration of an inline token family — the TYPES only.
 *
 * An inline token is a decorator node that PERSISTS AS TEXT — `[[page:<id>]]`,
 * `[[date:<iso>]]`, `\(latex\)`, `![alt](/api/attachments/<id>)`. Every such
 * family used to hand-write the same five things: a `DecoratorNode` subclass, a
 * `serializeNode` writing the token, a `deserializePattern` reading it back, a
 * `createNodeFromMatch` building the node, and a `getTextContent` decision. The
 * first and the last two could disagree with each other silently, and a stub
 * class lacking `getTextContent` made hydration SUCCEED while deleting the token
 * (the hazard `page/markdown-apply/server/internal/block-doc-text.ts` warns
 * about).
 *
 * Here the family declares only what is irreducible — its type string, its field
 * names, how a field record spells its token, and how a regex match reads the
 * fields back — and everything else is derived. There is no way to obtain a node
 * class for this system except through `defineInlineTokenNode` (the `node`
 * sub-plugin), which requires `token`, so a class that serializes to `""` cannot
 * be written.
 *
 * ## Why this file holds only types
 *
 * Every `lexical` import here is `import type`, which emits NOTHING at runtime.
 * That is load-bearing: this plugin's barrel is reachable from
 * `@plugins/page/plugins/editor/server`, which drizzle-kit loads SYNCHRONOUSLY
 * when it generates migrations — and `lexical` has an async-only module in its
 * graph, so one runtime edge to it makes every page schema file unloadable and
 * its tables silently vanish from migration generation. The class factory that
 * needs `DecoratorNode` as a VALUE therefore lives one level down, in the
 * `node` sub-plugin. See this plugin's `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * ## Why `fields` is a LIST of names, not one blob
 *
 * `@lexical/yjs` hydrates a decorator by `new Klass()` and then copying the
 * `Y.XmlElement`'s ATTRIBUTES onto the instance as `__`-prefixed own properties
 * (`createLexicalNodeFromCollabNode` -> `$syncPropertiesFromYjs`). Which
 * properties it will ever sync is decided ONCE, at binding setup, by
 * `initializeNodeProperties`: it constructs `new klass()` with NO ARGUMENTS and
 * snapshots `Object.entries(node)`. So every field must be a separate own
 * enumerable property, present after a ZERO-ARG construction — which is why the
 * synthesized constructor seeds each `__<field>` with `""` and takes only an
 * optional `key`.
 *
 * ## Two runtimes, one class hierarchy
 *
 * The class `defineInlineTokenNode` mints is HEADLESS: `decorate()` returns null
 * and `createDOM()` throws. A browser host calls {@link InlineTokenNode.decorated}
 * to obtain a twin descriptor over a SUBCLASS that adds only rendering — same
 * type string, same fields, same token format, because they come from the same
 * declaration. The headless class is what a server (or a headless `readYDoc`)
 * registers; the decorated subclass is what a live editor registers. Never both
 * in one editor: Lexical keys its registry by type string and rejects a second
 * class for it.
 *
 * ## Why there are TWO descriptor types
 *
 * {@link InlineTokenNodeRef} is what a REGISTRY stores, and it is field-type
 * erased. {@link InlineTokenNode} is what the DECLARING plugin holds, and it
 * knows the family's `F`. The split is not decoration — it is what makes the
 * erasure a real subtype relation rather than a cast:
 *
 * A registry is a homogeneous list, so it must name ONE type for every family's
 * descriptor. If that one type were `InlineTokenNode<TokenFields>`, then storing
 * a `InlineTokenNode<PageLinkFields>` in it would ask TypeScript to accept an
 * assignment it cannot: `F` sits in a CONSUMER position on the typed half
 * (`create(fields: F)`, `tokenOf(fields: F)`, `setFields(node, Partial<F>)`),
 * and `keyof F` appears in `fields` — which makes the generic INVARIANT, so the
 * two instantiations are related in neither direction. Every registration site
 * became a type error, and the only way to keep one type was to cast the
 * variance away.
 *
 * So the erased half simply does not mention `F`. Everything a registry needs of
 * a family — name it, register its class, ask "is this node yours?", serialize
 * one of its nodes, build one from a regex match — is expressible without ever
 * accepting an `F` from the caller: the erased builder takes the MATCH and reads
 * the fields with the family's own `fieldsOf`, so the only `F` that reaches a
 * family is one it produced itself. The typed half adds the `F`-accepting
 * members and is held only by the plugin that declared the family, where `F` is
 * known. `InlineTokenNode<F> extends InlineTokenNodeRef`, so the erasure is
 * ordinary subtyping — no cast anywhere, and no unsound widening either.

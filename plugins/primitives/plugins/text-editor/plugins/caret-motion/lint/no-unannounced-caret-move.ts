/**
 * Naming a HORIZONTAL arrow command is the proxy for "this file moves a caret
 * sideways". It is a proxy, and the bound is stated rather than hidden: a mover
 * that relocates the caret from a `beforeinput`, paste or pointer handler slips
 * through. That is acceptable — those are not crossings, and landing on the
 * un-crossed state is correct for them.
 *
 * The check is at MODULE level ("names the command"), not at the
 * `registerCommand(...)` call site, because registration is routinely indirect:
 * the page editor registers all eight of its keys through a local `reg` helper,
 * which a call-site rule would silently miss — a rule that catches nothing is
 * the same failure as one that fires wrongly.

 * `children` it is that one row permanently, and drops the chevron with it.
 *
 * This is the sanctioned home for the "card whose title expands it" shape. It
 * exists so a stack of such cards is uniform BY CONSTRUCTION: the caller supplies
 * a title and a body, never the chrome, so no two cards can drift on padding,
 * radius, title typography, or chevron placement.
 *
 * The body is genuinely unmounted while collapsed (`CollapsibleContent`), so a
 * heavy panel costs nothing until opened. Anything that must keep running while
 * the card is shut (persistence, subscriptions) does not belong in the body —
 * lift it into a headless always-mounted component.

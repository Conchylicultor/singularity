/**
 * The ONE element a slot draws around each contribution — its box.
 *
 * Two roles in one element, deliberately:
 *
 * 1. **Layout.** Horizontal hosts get a `min-w-0` flex cell that relays the
 *    shrink-chain (so flexible text truncates instead of wrapping); everything
 *    else gets `display:contents`, a layout-neutral box.
 *
 *    `horizontal` is what the slot MEASURED off its own host; a host that
 *    relocates contributions into a different layout context (the `overflow`
 *    node type's dropdown panel) DECLARES the truth via `<SlotItemLayout>`, and
 *    the declaration wins. A component rather than a bare element for exactly
 *    that reason: the override has to be read where the contribution renders,
 *    not where its element was created.
 *
 *    The GROW half of the same chain is not declared — it is **asked for**. A
 *    cell is rigid by default, which is right for the buttons and chips a chrome
 *    row is usually made of and wrong for the one contribution meant to expand
 *    into the row's slack: that contribution's box would shrink-wrap to its own
 *    content, so anything inside it that sizes itself from the room it is given
 *    (an `AdaptiveBar`, a truncating strip) reads its own content back as "the
 *    room I have" — a measurement that moves with the answer it produces. So the
 *    cell is a `GrowRelay`: the widget that needs the slack asks for it from
 *    where it is rendered, and the cell grows because it was asked. Nothing
 *    about the widget's need has to be restated on the contribution, several
 *    files away, for the two to agree.
 *
 *    `fill` remains as the explicit declaration — a contribution that wants the
 *    slack with no such widget inside it, and reorder's own (block-axis) reading
 *    of the same flag for its edit-mode wrapper.
 *
 * 2. **Identity.** It is where `registerSlotItemAttrs` consumers stamp what this
 *    contribution IS. The box is drawn by the slot but belongs to the
 *    contribution, and it is usually a little bigger than what the contribution
 *    paints inside it — so anything describing a contribution has to describe
 *    the box, or the slack around a small widget (most of what there is to point
 *    at when the widget is a 4px bar in a 24px row) answers for nobody.
 *
 * Its element type is stable across the post-measure `horizontal` flip, so React
 * reconciles each contribution subtree in place instead of tearing it down and
 * rebuilding it on every (re)mount.
 *
 * With no layout role AND nothing to stamp there is no element at all — the
 * paths that draw no cell (`.Mount`, `.Dispatch`) stay exactly as bare as they
 * were before any of this existed.

 * Ordered-dispatch sibling of `defineDispatchSlot`: the runtime is literally
 * `defineDispatchSlot` — same registration, same `.Dispatch` single-match
 * selection, same item-middleware isolation. ONLY the contribution TYPE differs:
 * contributions must carry an `id: string` (`OrderedDispatchContribution`).
 *
 * That id is what lets the slot participate in the reorder config-tree system.
 * A plain dispatch slot is absent from the reorderable-slots manifest and its
 * contributions carry no id, so it can neither be grouped nor reordered. An
 * ordered-dispatch slot is `reorderable` in its own `meta` and therefore owes an
 * authored config override, exactly like a render slot — but it renders via
 * `.Dispatch` (one match), not `.Render` (all contributions). Consumers that
 * want the config order (grouped menus, ordered pickers) read that order through
 * the reorder read hook; the slot itself keeps pure dispatch semantics.
 *
 * Because the runtime IS `defineDispatchSlot`, this used to be a TS cast and
 * nothing else: the slot's own identity existed only as the spelling of this
 * function's name in source text, recoverable by grep and by nothing else. It
 * now overwrites `meta`, so the fact is on the object.

# slot-render

## `defineRenderSlot` vs `defineMountSlot`

Two constructors for "render all contributions, each error-boundary-isolated",
distinguished by whether the contributions are *visible*:

- **`defineRenderSlot(id, config?)`** — a **visible** slot. `.Render` paints
  every contribution (item middlewares + the list/reorder middleware). Always
  **reorderable** — there is no opt-out. Every render slot appears in the
  reorder manifest and gets an authored config override.

- **`defineMountSlot<P>(id, config?)`** — a **headless** slot. Its `.Mount`
  component (prop-less) mounts every contribution wrapped only in the item
  middlewares (error-boundary isolation) — no list/reorder middleware, no flex
  sentinel, no `controlSize`. The contribution `component` is typed
  `(props) => null`, a **compile-time** guarantee that a mount contribution
  renders nothing: a component that returns JSX (or `ReactElement | null`) fails
  to type-check. Mount slots are **never reorderable** and are absent from the
  reorder manifest. Use them for side-effect-only contributions (observers,
  recorders) that need per-contribution crash isolation but paint no UI.

Reorderability is now a property of the **constructor**, not a boolean flag.
There is no `reorder?: boolean` option — pick the constructor whose reorder
semantics you want:

- **`defineRenderSlot`** — visible, renders every contribution → **reorderable**
  (always in the manifest, owes an authored config).
- **`defineMountSlot`** — headless, side-effect-only → **never reorderable**
  (absent from the manifest).
- **`defineDispatchSlot`** — visible, single-match selection → **not
  reorderable** (contributions carry no `id`, so nothing to order).
- **`defineOrderedDispatchSlot`** — dispatch selection **plus** reorder
  participation → **reorderable**. Same runtime as `defineDispatchSlot` (one
  match via `.Dispatch`), but contributions require `id: string` so the slot
  can be ordered — it declares `meta.reorderable` like a render slot, and owes
  an authored config override. Consumers that need the config order (grouped
  menus, ordered pickers) read that order through the reorder read hook — the
  slot itself renders pure dispatch.

## Single-line discipline for horizontal slots

`.Render` detects whether its host is a **flex row** at runtime (via a
`display:none` sentinel — same technique as the reorder list middleware) and,
for row slots, wraps every contribution in a `min-w-0` flex cell. Detection
gates on the host actually being a flex container (`display:flex`/`inline-flex`)
*before* reading `flex-direction` — `flex-direction` computes to `row` for every
element (it's the CSS initial value), so a plain block or grid host would
otherwise be misread as a row and collapse wide block content to min-content
width. Non-flex hosts fall through to the untouched vertical path. This keeps
the flex shrink-chain unbroken above each contribution, so flexible text can
truncate instead of wrapping when a chrome row is compressed. Contributors
declare nothing; vertical lists are untouched.

What this does and does NOT do:

- **Cell provides `min-w-0`** at the boundary — the chain link contributors
  couldn't fix themselves and silently broke truncation.
- **Fixed-size controls** are unaffected: the `Button` primitive is already
  `shrink-0`. Anything that must not shrink should be `shrink-0` (opt-out). A
  forgotten `shrink-0` fails *loudly* (visible squish at any width).
- **Leaf text still needs truncation.** CSS can't truncate arbitrarily-nested
  text from an ancestor — render the flexible label as a `<Text>` (from
  `@plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/text/web`) inside a line container
  (`Frame`/`Row`/`Bar`), which provides the ambient `SingleLine` context so the
  `<Text>` ellipsizes. The cell only makes that truncation *work*.
- The few chrome containers (`app-shell` header, `pane-chrome` title row) add
  `overflow-hidden` as a fixed-height safety net so a forgotten leaf truncation
  clips to one line instead of breaking the layout.

### The cell grows because it was asked, not because it was told

A row cell is **rigid** by default (`flex: 0 1 auto`): right for the buttons and
chips a chrome row is made of, wrong for a contribution meant to expand into the
row's free space. A rigid cell shrink-wraps to its content, so anything inside
that sizes itself from the room it is given — an `AdaptiveBar`, a truncating
strip — reads its own content back as "the room I have", a measurement that moves
with the answer it produces.

The cell is a [`GrowRelay`](../css/plugins/grow-relay/CLAUDE.md): the widget that
needs the slack asks for it from where it is rendered, and the cell grows because
it was asked. The ask travels on, so a wrapper a host adds *inside* the cell
relays too (`prompt-editor`'s toolbar does) instead of the chain breaking one
level down. Nothing about the widget's need is restated on the contribution —
which is what it used to be, several files away, and both consumers in the repo
got it wrong once each.

Only the **row** branch is a relay. The `display:contents` branch generates no
box, so it has nothing to grow — and the ask crosses it for free, because
context passes through any component that is not a relay.

`fill: true` remains on the contribution for the two things nobody can ask for:
a contribution that wants the slack with no such widget inside it, and reorder's
own reading of the flag for its edit-mode wrapper — where it means the **block**
axis (a bounded flex column so an inner scroll region clamps), a different
question from the inline grow the cell relays.

### Relocating hosts declare their layout

The measurement is the slot's *host*, so it is wrong for a host that moves
contributions somewhere else — the `overflow` reorder node type portals its
members into a dropdown panel, where a horizontal cell makes each menu row a
shrink-wrapping flex item. Such a host wraps the relocated children in
`<SlotItemLayout orientation="column">` (or `"row"`), which the cell honors over
what was measured. Read at render position, so it applies to contributions whose
elements were created upstream.

## Dispatch outcome

`.Dispatch` publishes what it did, so a descendant can react to *"nothing handled
this"* without every fallback component threading a prop by hand:

```ts
const outcome = useDispatchOutcome(); // { slotId, key, matched } | null
if (!outcome || outcome.matched) return null; // only render on a fallback
```

- **`matched`** is `true` when a contribution matched, `false` when the slot's
  `fallback` rendered (or nothing did). It is the whole point of the signal: the
  fact was already known inside `.Dispatch` (`matchedIndex < 0`) and published
  nowhere, so each fallback had to be wired up individually and every new one
  started out missing the affordance.
- **`key`** is `config.key(props)` for that render, **`slotId`** the slot's id.
- Outside any dispatch slot, `useDispatchOutcome()` returns `null`.

**Nearest wins, and that is the correct answer.** Dispatch slots nest: a
conversation tool row renders `EventRenderer.Dispatch` (matched → the tool-call
row) inside which `Tool.Renderer.Dispatch` may fall back to a generic view. The
context reports the *innermost* dispatch, which is the honest answer for the row
being rendered — a `Bash` card is handled, a `SendMessage` card is not. Consumers
should not try to reach an outer dispatch; if you need that, the surface you are
building belongs at that outer level.

**The value is three primitives, deliberately.** No `props`, no matched
`Contribution`. Either would change the context value's identity on every render
of the hottest paths in the app (the conversation transcript dispatches per event
row), re-rendering every consumer for churn that says nothing new. Consumers that
need the props already have them — they are rendered *by* the dispatch. For the
same reason the memo depends on the **boolean** `matched`, not `matchedIndex`:
reordering contributions must not churn the value.

The provider wraps **outside** the item middlewares, so the outcome stays
readable from inside an error-boundary fallback.

`DispatchOutcomeContext` itself is **not** exported — `.Dispatch` is the single
writer. A consumer able to provide it could lie about whether its subtree was
handled.

`renderIsolated()` publishes **nothing** (no provider, so `useDispatchOutcome()`
falls through to whatever dispatch encloses it, usually `null`). Slots that
select via `renderIsolated` — `data-view`'s `cell` / `cell-editor` — therefore
have no outcome signal; they would each need their own if one is ever wanted.

`defineOrderedDispatchSlot` *is* `defineDispatchSlot` at runtime, so it publishes
the outcome too, with no separate code path.

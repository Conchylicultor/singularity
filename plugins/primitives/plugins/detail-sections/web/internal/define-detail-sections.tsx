/**
 * A detail pane is ONE render slot whose sections are contributions.
 *
 * `defineDetailSections("<id>")` returns `{ Section, Host, SectionItem }`:
 * plugins contribute `DetailSection`s to `Section`, the pane renders
 * `<Host {...entityProps}/>`, and the host paints every section as a
 * `SectionCard` — a `Card` with a collapsible title row. There is exactly one
 * mode: the chrome is not configurable per pane and there is NO per-section
 * opt-out, so no two panes' section stacks can drift on padding, radius, title
 * typography, or chevron placement. A pane with more than one zone (Sonata's
 * `area`-split column) paints each section with `SectionItem` — the SAME chrome,
 * laid out by the pane.
 *
 * A pane's **identity block** (title input, primary actions) is a section like
 * any other, card and all: the entity's name lives in the pane header, so a
 * collapsed identity card loses nothing. An earlier `chrome: "none"` opt-out for
 * it was removed — it was indistinguishable from "this panel doesn't want your
 * card", which is how a self-painted card frame got back in.
 *
 * ## One line ⇒ no chevron
 *
 * A section whose whole content is one line — a path, a count, a chip row, a
 * single button — declares NO `component` and puts that line in `summary`
 * (info) and/or `actions` (control). The host then paints one static row: no
 * chevron, nothing to expand, nothing to persist. The affordance is derived
 * from the body's absence rather than declared, so "a chevron that opens onto
 * one line" and "a body with no way to open it" are both unrepresentable.
 *
 * ## Nothing to show ⇒ nothing painted
 *
 * A body that `return null`s still leaves a titled bar the user can open onto
 * emptiness: the host paints the chrome and cannot see through the body. A
 * section that can have nothing to show therefore declares `useAvailable`,
 * which is resolved BEFORE anything is painted.
 *
 * ## Open state
 *
 * Resolves persisted user toggle → `useDefaultOpen?.(props)` → `false`. The
 * persisted choice is device-local (`useDraft`, localStorage) under
 * `` `<slotId>.<sectionId>.open` ``, where `slotId` is this factory's own
 * `` `${id}.section` `` — so two panes' identically-named sections can never
 * collide.
 *
 * ## A collapsed body is genuinely UNMOUNTED
 *
 * `SectionCard`'s body is a `CollapsibleContent`, which renders `null` while
 * collapsed — a heavy panel costs nothing until opened. The corollary is a trap:
 * anything that must keep running regardless of the panel's state (debounced
 * persistence, a subscription that outlives the panel, a sync observer) does NOT
 * belong in the body. Lift it into a headless always-mounted contribution — a
 * `defineMountSlot` slot on the owning pane — and keep the body purely visual.
 *
 * ## Slot id (load-bearing)
 *
 * The emitted slot id is `` `${id}.section` `` verbatim, and
 * `reorderDirectiveDescriptor` uses a slot id verbatim as its config_v2 config
 * name. Renaming a slot silently resets every user's persisted section order on
 * that pane — never change the shape of this string.

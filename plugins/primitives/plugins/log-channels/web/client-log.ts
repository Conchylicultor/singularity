// Browser console.log-style logging that persists to a per-worktree JSONL file

// buffered per channel and flushed (debounced) to POST /api/logs/emit, which
// appends them to the per-worktree logs directory (see persist.ts / logs CLAUDE.md).
//
// Flush invariants (every trigger goes through `requestFlush`):
// - Single-flight: at most one flush runs; a trigger during it re-runs it once after.
// - Hold after failure: a rejected POST sets a hold whose one timer is the ONLY
//   thing that flushes next — 5 s after a plain failure, 30 s after a 429. The
//   debounce and WS-`open` triggers are no-ops meanwhile, except that an `open`
//   lifts a plain-failure hold (the backend is back); it never lifts a 429 hold.
// - No polling: timers exist only for the debounce and on a failure edge.

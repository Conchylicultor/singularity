// id, so each such channel can't be its own `defineFileSink` (no fixed path
// known ahead of time). They ALL share the same 128 MB × 3 rotation via
// `openDynamicSink`, which sanitizes the id into the logs dir and does NOT touch
// the sink registry (registering each dynamic id would make the registry itself
// unbounded).
//
// The whole family is declared ONCE as a single `file:client-log` bound so it is
// enumerable and growth-bounded in `getFileSinks()` — the whole point of the
// durable-sink invariant. `defineFileSink` is per-path, which the family isn't;
// this representative entry (path `<logsDir>/client-log.jsonl`, never itself
// written unless a browser literally names a channel "client-log") stands in for
// the family. The real per-channel writes go to sibling `<channel>.jsonl` files
// under the same rotation.
//
// It is declared LAZILY on the first ingress (not at module eval): resolving the
// logs dir reads SINGULARITY_WORKTREE, and this module is on the import path of
// the log-channels/server barrel, which must stay import-safe. First-ingress is
// also exactly when the first client-log file starts existing.

/**
 * Ingest ONE `POST /api/logs/emit` body. Route-internal ONLY (the emit handler) —
 * NOT exported from the plugin barrel. Persistence here is inherent to the ingress
 * (client logs must survive to disk), which is exactly why this can't be a general
 * `Log.emit` callable from arbitrary server code: durable sinks are declared, and
 * the one open-ended family is declared above.
 *
 * It takes the whole validated body rather than one line, because this function
 * exists for exactly one route: the wire type IS its domain type, so the zod
 * `.min(1).max(MAX_EMIT_LINES)` that bounds the array is the same type the ingress
 * consumes, and there is no singular form left for a handler to loop over. The
 * family bound is ensured once, the channel resolved once, and the batch reaches
 * the sink as ONE write.
 *
 * The `map` below is the layer boundary where the wire's `t` becomes the
 * registry's `timestamp` — one name per concept, renamed in exactly one place.

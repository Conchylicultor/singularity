/**
 * Declare a DURABLE log channel: registers the channel AND (on its first publish)
 * its bounded-append file sink (128 MB × 3 rotation, true by construction). This
 * is the ONLY way to get a persisted channel — there is no `persist` flag. The
 * channel is registered exactly once here (a duplicate id throws), so a channel
 * written from two modules must share ONE `defineLogSink` call.
 *
 * The file sink is built LAZILY on first publish: its path resolution reads
 * SINGULARITY_WORKTREE, which must not run at module import (this barrel is
 * imported inside the import-safe @plugins/database/server graph). The on-disk
 * file is `<logsDir>/<id>.jsonl`; the id must match what the read path
 * (`readChannelEntries`) reconstructs, so both derive the filename through
 * `sanitizeChannel`.

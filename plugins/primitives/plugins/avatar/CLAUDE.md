# avatar

Reusable circular avatar primitive — an icon on a colored disc, with an
optional status dot overlay (Slack-style). Pure web; no server, no slots.

## Size: density from context (no prop)

An `Avatar`'s size has **no prop** — it tracks the ambient `ControlSize`
(`useControlSize`), keying its `SIZE_MAP` bundle (box / icon / pinned status dot
/ ring offsets) off the four density tiers `xs | sm | md | lg`. Deliberate
sizing is a `<ControlSizeProvider size>` around the region (mirroring `Badge`),
never a per-instance `size`; passing one is a compile error (`size?: never`).
The no-provider default is `md`.

## Presentation: badge or tile (from context)

How an avatar draws is also a region property —
`<AvatarPresentationProvider value>` / `useAvatarPresentation()`, modelled on
`ControlSizeProvider`:

- **`badge`** (default, no provider): the density-ramp size above and the SOFT
  paint (a 15% tint of the colour, the colour as the glyph).
- **`tile`**: the box fills its parent (the view sizes the tile, so density is
  ignored), the FLAT paint (the solid colour under the `categorical-foreground` glyph token, white by default), the glyph at
  46% of the box (svg by `size-[46%]`, a fallback letter by a `cqh` font size on
  the box's size container), and the status dot has no ring.

A field renders its avatar without knowing which one it is in; the launcher view
declares `tile` once around its items.

## Colour: one pick, two paints

`avatarColorPick(color, fallbackKey) → { slot, shade } | null` is the one rule:
an explicit known colour wins (shade 0); otherwise the key hashes to one of the
eight automatic slots (`hash % 8`) and a shade (`floor(hash / 8) % 2`), giving 16
tile colours. `null` is the neutral muted box. `avatarSoftClass(pick)` is the
badge paint (one per slot — the shade is ignored, so every badge is exactly what
it was before shades existed; `colors.test.ts` pins that for a fixed key set) and
`avatarFlatClass(pick)` the tile paint (10 slots × 2 shades, shade 1 =
`bg-categorical-N-lift`, the slot lifted 0.13 in OKLCH lightness, derived once in
ui-kit's `app.css` `@theme inline` block). `avatarColorClass` is
`avatarSoftClass(avatarColorPick(…))`.

The closed colour list (`AVATAR_COLOR_NAMES`, `AvatarColor`) and `AvatarShape`
live in `core/`, so a non-web descriptor (an app icon's declared colour) can type
a colour without importing web code.

## Components

- `<Avatar icon? color? shape? statusDot? fallbackGlyph? fallbackKey? colorless? />`
  — renders a badge or tile (see Presentation).
  - `shape`: `circle` (default, `rounded-full`) or `squircle` (the
    `rounded-squircle` utility — 26% of the box, a proportional shape outside
    the `--radius` scale like `rounded-full`).
  - `icon`: key into `AVATAR_ICONS` (e.g. `"robot"`, `"rocket"`).
  - `color`: key into `AVATAR_COLORS` (Tailwind hue names). Falls back to a
    deterministic auto-color derived from `fallbackKey` (or `icon`) when null.
  - `statusDot`: a Tailwind background class (e.g. `bg-amber-500`). When
    set, renders a small dot bottom-right with a ring matching the surface
    bg, like Slack's presence indicator.
  - `fallbackGlyph`: a single character (first char used, uppercased) rendered
    centered when there is no icon/svg, so the disc is never blank. Sized per
    density via the box's own `text-*` class. Providing it also tints the
    disc via the deterministic auto-color (unless `color` is set or `colorless`).
  - `fallbackKey`: stable key feeding the deterministic auto-color hash.
  - `colorless`: forces the neutral muted disc, ignoring `color`, the
    auto-color, and any `fallbackGlyph` tint.
- `<AvatarPicker value onChange children />` — popover trigger that opens
  a color row + the shared `<IconPicker>` (from the `icon-picker` primitive) +
  a clear row. Calls `onChange` immediately on selection (no submit). The
  trigger is whatever you pass as children (typically an `<Avatar>`).

  It is a `ControlPanelPopover size="picker"`, not a hand-rolled `Popover`: the
  swatch cluster, the icon block and the Clear row inherit ONE content inset
  from the panel, and the rules between the three bands are the container's —
  there is no `h-px bg-border` here to place, forget or double. The swatch grid
  itself is unchanged: `ControlPanel` owns geometry, never content layout.

## Relationship to `icon-picker`

The icon registry, search grid, `SvgNode` storage format, and server-side SVG
resolution live in the [`icon-picker`](../icon-picker/CLAUDE.md) primitive.
`avatar` composes `<IconPicker>` and adds only its own concerns: the colored
disc (`<Avatar>`), the color palette, and `AvatarSpec` (icon + color +
`svgNodes`). The `SvgNode` type is imported from `icon-picker/core`.

## Why a separate primitive

Future surfaces (per-user identity, per-task icons, contact rows in
chat-style panes) will all consume the same primitive. Keeping it
self-contained avoids each consumer reinventing the colored disc and
color palette.

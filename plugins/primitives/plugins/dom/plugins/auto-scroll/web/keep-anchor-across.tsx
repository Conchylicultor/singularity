 * is scrolled by however far that element moved. Applied only when
 * `changeKey` says the content may have moved.
 *
 * It is the ONLY anchoring inside its region: the region's box opts out of
 * browser scroll anchoring (`overflow-anchor: none`). Two anchorings acting on
 * one commit pick their anchors independently, and the browser's picks
 * whatever box is on screen — inside a windowed list that is a spacer or a row
 * the window is about to recycle, so it scrolls by how far THAT moved (the
 * height of a page swapped above the reader, measured: a jump of thousands of
 * px) on top of the correction made here.
 *
 * A class for the reason {@link KeepScrollAcross} is one: no hook runs before
 * React's mutations. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` finds the anchor and its
 * offset while the old content is still in place; `componentDidUpdate`
 * re-measures it (one forced layout) and scrolls before paint. An anchor gone
 * after the commit (it was replaced) leaves the scroller alone.

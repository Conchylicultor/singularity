# auto-scroll

The **scroll-owning** primitive: the one sanctioned home for driving a scroll
container. `no-adhoc-scroll-write` (see
[`scroll-safety`](../../../../../framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/lint/plugins/scroll-safety/CLAUDE.md))
bans `scrollTop =` / `scrollTo()` / `scrollBy()` repo-wide except in this
plugin's own files, so a new scroll behavior belongs *here*, not in the consumer
that wants it. Today that is six roles:

- **stick-to-bottom streaming** — `useStickyScroll` + `JumpToBottomButton`
- **container-scoped positioning** — `scrollToBottom`, `scrollChildIntoView`
  (scroll only THIS container; never an ancestor, unlike `scrollIntoView`)
- **gesture edge auto-scroll** — `useEdgeAutoScroll`
- **scroll kept across a wholesale swap** — `KeepScrollAcross`
- **scroll carried to a new document** — `captureDocumentScroll` /
  `restoreDocumentScroll`
- **scroll-container discovery** — `findScrollParent`

## `useStickyScroll` — following is an intent, never an inference

You follow until a scroll **the hook did not author** lands you elsewhere; you
follow again when such a scroll lands you back at the bottom. Content settling,
reflow and new messages only *carry out* that standing intent. Consumers render
the returned `bottomSentinel` as the scroll container's last child (asserted at
mount) and signal nothing — there is no content-length effect to remember.

**Do not reintroduce a size observer.**
[`research/2026-05-25-global-sticky-scroll-redesign.md`](../../../../../../research/2026-05-25-global-sticky-scroll-redesign.md)
removed one because a size delta is *sign-blind*: opening the file pane rewraps
text taller, which is indistinguishable from new content. Watching the sentinel
(`useInView`, from [`primitives/dom/in-view`](../in-view/CLAUDE.md)) is instead
*sign-asymmetric* — a taller reflow can only make the bottom **less** visible —
so it can exclusively un-follow, and a signal like that cannot drag anyone
downward. Asserted in
`internal/sticky-scroll-machine.test.ts`. The guarantee is narrower than it
sounds: while following, reflow *does* write. It is "no observation-driven writes
**while not following**".

**Intent = a scroll whose offset ≠ what we last wrote** (read back after writing,
so clamping counts). Do **not** swap in gesture listeners: they miss scrollbar
drags, find-in-page, `useEdgeAutoScroll`, and `revealElement` — which
`jsonl-pane`'s `StickyUserHeader` fires on expand, so a user at the bottom would
be yanked back and the expand undone on the same frame. **Every own write must be
instant, including `jumpToBottom`** — a smooth scroll's intermediate offsets never
match the recorded one, so the hook reads its own animation as the user leaving
and cancels the jump mid-flight. The one thing the comparison cannot serve is the
`scroll` handler itself (IO delivers async, so its cached answer describes the
pre-scroll position); that reads geometry via `isAtBottom`, which is safe because
only a position change fires `scroll`.

**`followKey` means "the user just acted"** — never ambient state. `isWorking`
also rises when a background agent resumes, which must not move a reading user.

**Sentinel geometry, both load-bearing** (the observer is `in-view`'s; the
geometry and the follow policy stay here): the pin `threshold` becomes bottom
`rootMargin` (a zero-height node at `threshold: 0` means a 0px pin distance), and
the root is widened hugely left/right so horizontal scroll on an `axis="both"`
surface can't carry the sentinel out of view.

**`persist: { key, anchorAttr }`** (opt-in): `key` must identify the *surface
instance* (compose `useSurfaceTabId()`) — two panes can show one conversation at
different positions. `anchorAttr`'s value must be content identity: use
`data-event-key`, never `data-event-index`, which indexes the *filtered* array and
re-points whenever an `EventFilter` resolves. A saved anchor whose row is gone
returns `missing`, distinct from `none`, so a key-scheme regression can't read as
"first visit".

## `KeepScrollAcross` — a swap must not move the reader

A commit that replaces a region's content wholesale (the tree switching between
its plain and its windowed render) removes every child before inserting the
replacement. Anything that forces a layout in between — a blur handler of the
removed focused node, scroll anchoring re-selecting from a vanished anchor —
sees short content and the browser clamps the scroller, so the list jumps to the
top although its full height is back before paint. No hook runs before React's
mutations, which is why this one is a class: `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` reads the
offset, `componentDidUpdate` writes it back. It acts only when `swapKey`
changes, so ordinary updates force no layout. Restoring in the layout phase also
lands before a child's state-driven follow-up render — `useVirtualRows` attaches
its virtualizer there and reads the restored offset as its `initialOffset`.

## `captureDocumentScroll` / `restoreDocumentScroll` — a reload keeps the place

For a same-origin iframe whose new document replaces the old one (the prototype
canvas swaps a loaded twin in on every live edit): capture every scroll offset
of the outgoing document, restore them into the incoming one, matched by id or
else DOM path. A client-rendered page is not tall enough at `load`, so the
restore re-tries on every DOM mutation and sub-resource load until each offset
is reached, the reader acts (wheel / touch / key / pointer — never `scroll`,
which our own writes fire), or 5 s pass; the returned function cancels it.
Script state is not carried — it lives in the old document.

## `useEdgeAutoScroll` — the gesture contract

While a gesture's pointer sits in the top or bottom edge band of its scroll
viewport, the surface scrolls, ramping up the closer to the edge. The hook knows
nothing about the gesture: the consumer feeds it a viewport `clientY` (`track`)
and ends it (`stop`, from pointerup **and** pointercancel). Vertical only,
deliberately — a speculative `axis` option would be an untested path.

**`onScroll` is the gesture's second clock, not a notification.** While the
pointer is parked at an edge it is the ONLY thing driving the consumer forward —
the pointer did not move, the *content* did — so a gesture re-evaluating only on
`pointermove` would scroll the document and select nothing new. Extract the
per-move body into one applier called from both places. Mirror rule: **`track` is
called from the pointer handler only, never from that applier**, or the hook
re-latches off its own callback. (It fires only on a frame that actually moved the
surface: at a clamped edge the consumer's per-frame work must not run for nothing.)

**What it scrolls is an `EdgeScrollSurface`** — an edge band plus a
`scrollBy(px)` that says whether anything moved. `anchorRef` builds the usual one
from a DOM scroll container (carrying the sub-pixel remainder, since `scrollBy`
moves in whole px). A surface whose scroll is not a `scrollTop` passes its own
via `surface` instead: the Sonata piano roll scrolls by moving the playhead, so
its surface's `scrollBy` is a seek (see `apps/sonata/progress/loop`).

**The surface is resolved per gesture** — lazily on the first `track` after
a `stop`, never at mount: the anchor may be unmounted when the hook first runs,
and a host may re-parent the surface between gestures.

**`requireOverflowing: true`** (the `anchorRef` form) is what keeps failure loud. The plain walk returns
the first *style*-scrollable ancestor even when its content currently fits, and
the loop would then run at 60fps writing a `scrollTop` that never budges —
indistinguishable from "parked at the bottom". Callers that merely *read* a scroll
offset (windowing) want the opposite default, since the styled ancestor is right
even before enough rows arrive to overflow it. Hence an opt-in, not one behavior.

    "The declared embedded-document signal: embedMode() reads the `?embed=` flag once at boot (the pane router drops every query on its first write, so it cannot be re-read) — `?embed=1` opens one route with no app chrome, `?embed=chrome` opens the whole app, chrome included — and embedUrl(path, mode) builds an in-app URL that opens that way. isChromelessDocument() is read by the apps layout (no tab bar, no rail) and the floating action bar (hidden); isEmbeddedDocument() by the two sessionStorage writers (app-instance registry, persisted tabs) so a same-origin frame in either mode never evicts the host tab's own state.",

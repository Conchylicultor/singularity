/**
 * Indent guides for one row: a hairline per ancestor level, each at
 * `--tree-guide-x` (density, default the middle) of its `--tree-indent` step of
 * the row's indent — under the chevron / icon slot of
 * the ancestor that level belongs to — in `--tree-guide` (color-palette,
 * default the border colour).
 *
 * ONE box drawing every level: a repeating background tile the width of one
 * indent step, laid over the row's indent padding (from the row's lead inset
 * to its first content), so the levels cannot drift from the indent they mark
 * and a depth-12 row costs the same as a depth-1 one. Each row draws its own
 * full height, so a run of rows reads as continuous lines. Decorative: it never
 * takes a click, and lives in the padding, so it moves no content and no
 * aligned column.

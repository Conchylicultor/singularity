/**
 * The two questions a per-row "fold/unfold everything below me" affordance asks,

 *
 * The shape matters as much as the answers. `getAllExpanded` is the render-time
 * half — every row with children calls it on every render — so it must be a map
 * lookup, not a walk. `getSubtreeChanges` is the click-time half, called once
 * per gesture, so it may walk the subtree it is about to rewrite.

/**
 * Build the index in ONE post-order walk of the whole forest — O(n) for the
 * render, not O(n) per row.
 *
 * The per-row shape is what forces this. The predecessor hook took `(rows,
 * rootId)` and rebuilt a parent map over all rows on every call; with one call
 * per row-with-children that is O(n × k) — worst case quadratic — paid on every
 * expand/collapse of the tasks list, the agents list and the Studio plugin
 * tree. Answering all n rows from one walk is the fix, and it is only possible
 * from the built tree (where a node already holds its children) rather than
 * from the flat rows.
 *
 * **A leaf is vacuously "all expanded."** It has nothing below it to be open or
 * closed, so it must not drag an ancestor's answer to false — a folder whose
 * children are all files is fully unfolded. This matches the semantics the three
 * consumer copies had, where the collected set only ever contained nodes that
 * themselves have children.

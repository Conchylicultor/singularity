/**
 * no-laundered-peek
 *
 * Bans an exported module-scope function that RETURNS a value derived from an
 * imperative sink sample, under a value-shaped name:
 *
 *   export function canNavigateApp() {
 *     return appNavSink.peek() !== null;                    // ← a bare forward
 *   }
 *   export function placementIsNewTabFollows(id: string) {
 *     return placementSink.peek()?.newTabFollows.has(id) ?? false;  // ← derived
 *   }
 *
 * The first shape is how the original incident was actually spelled; the second
 * is the shape the repo audit turned up, and is the same hazard one derivation
 * deeper. Both read at the call site like a plain fact about the world, so
 * nothing about them says "this answer was sampled once, from a slot that gets
 * filled one commit from now". A wrapper like this defeats
 * `no-render-phase-peek` in exactly one hop: the peek is no longer syntactically
 * inside the component, so the render walk never sees it, and the stale render
 * read gets written without ever looking like one.
 *
 * Three fixes, best first:
 *   1. Make it a PURE function that TAKES the installed value as an argument —
 *      then it cannot sample at all, and its caller must obtain the value
 *      through whichever path is right for its context.
 *   2. On a render path, publish and use the sink's subscribing `use…()` hook.
 *   3. If an imperative sample really is what callers want, name it `peek…` so
 *      `no-render-phase-peek` sees it at every call site.
 *
 * DETECTION — deliberately narrow (plugin rules run repo-wide as `error`, so a
 * false positive breaks the build):
 *
 *   The function must be EXPORTED and at MODULE scope (a `FunctionDeclaration`
 *   under `export`, or `export const f = () => …` / `= function () {…}`), its
 *   name must NOT already be `/^peek/` or a hook `/^use[A-Z]/`, and at least one
 *   of its RETURNED EXPRESSIONS must CONTAIN a peek call in its subtree.
 *
 *   "Returned expression" means the expression body of a concise arrow, or the
 *   argument of a `ReturnStatement` belonging to THIS function directly — the
 *   walk into the body does not descend into nested functions. The subtree scan
 *   of a returned expression likewise stops at any function boundary, so
 *   `return () => sink.peek()` is NOT flagged: the returned closure peeks when
 *   it is later called, in whatever context calls it, which is the deferred
 *   case this rule has nothing to say about.
 *
 * A function that ACTS on a peeked value and returns nothing
 * (`export function navigateApp(url) { appNavSink.peekOrThrow()(url); }`) is not
 * laundering the sample into a value, and is not flagged.

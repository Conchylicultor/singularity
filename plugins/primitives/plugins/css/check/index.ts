/**
 * `css:message-names-primitives` — the `no-adhoc-layout` error message must name
 * every layout-mechanic primitive that exists.
 *
 * WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS. The message is the only guidance most authors ever
 * read: it is what ESLint prints at the moment they write `flex-1`. When it
 * omitted `Fill`, `fillClasses()` collected ZERO callers outside its own plugin
 * while 14 sites hand-wrote `min-w-0 flex-1` under a disable comment — and the
 * near-identical `insetClass()`, advertised in `spacing/CLAUDE.md`, collected 6.
 * Discoverability was the entire difference. A primitive nobody is told about
 * does not exist.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST IS HARDCODED IN THE RULE, NOT DERIVED. Two reasons, both
 * structural. (1) The primitive set is CLOSED by construction — one primitive
 * per layout mechanic IS the design thesis — so the root CLAUDE.md's "closed
 * list ⇒ plain data" guidance applies, not the collection-consumer rule. (2)
 * Lint rules dual-load under jiti, which cannot resolve `@plugins/*`: a registry
 * import is the one form that provably does NOT work here. So the message is
 * plain text, and THIS check is what keeps it honest.
 *
 * HOW A LAYOUT MECHANIC IS TOLD FROM A PRESENTATIONAL PRIMITIVE. Not by
 * scanning sources: it was measured, and it does not separate them — `badge`,
 * `toggle-chip`, `selection-indicator` and `color-picker` all emit banned
 * structural tokens (`inline-flex`, `shrink-0`, `absolute`) for their own
 * internals, exactly as `fill` and `pin` do for their callers. There is no
 * threshold that splits the two sets.
 *
 * So the classification is a PARTITION over the DIRECTORY LISTING, declared in
 * exactly one place (`NOT_A_LAYOUT_MECHANIC` below), with the layout side
 * DERIVED as the complement:
 *
 *     layout mechanics  =  dirs(css/plugins/*)  −  NOT_A_LAYOUT_MECHANIC
 *
 * Three properties make it un-driftable — every divergence is a failure, never
 * a silent pass:
 *
 *   1. FAIL-CLOSED DEFAULT. A new directory is a layout mechanic until someone
 *      says otherwise, so the failure mode of forgetting is a red check, not a
 *      silently unadvertised primitive. (This is the whole point: `Layer`,
 *      `Rigid` and `Plane` land as new directories here.)
 *   2. NO STALE ENTRIES. An entry naming a directory that no longer exists
 *      fails, so a deleted primitive cannot leave a classification behind.
 *   3. NO CONTRADICTIONS. An entry declared presentational whose name the
 *      message DOES advertise fails, so the two halves cannot disagree about
 *      the same primitive.
 *
 * There is no second list of layout primitives to keep in sync with the message
 * — the message IS that list, and this check reads it.

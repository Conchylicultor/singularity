/**
 * Lint barrel for the `no-adhoc-layout` rule. The root `eslint.config.ts`
 * auto-discovers this default export and registers `no-adhoc-layout` repo-wide
 * as `error`.
 *
 * Layout composition routes through the layout primitives —
 * `<Stack>`/`<Cluster>`/`<Row>` (rows), `<Grid>`/`<Center>`/`<Overlay>`
 * (@plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/*), `<Stack>`/`<Inset>`
 * (@plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/spacing/web), and `<Text>` inside a line
 * container (the only home for `min-w-0`) — never raw `flex`/`grid`/`items-*`/`absolute`/`overflow-*`.
 *
 * The layout primitives THEMSELVES own the raw mechanics the rule redirects to
 * (they ARE the implementation); each declares that in its own `exempt/index.ts`.
 * A genuinely-fixed one-off escapes per-site, travelling with the code:
 *
 *   // eslint-disable-next-line layout/no-adhoc-layout -- <reason>

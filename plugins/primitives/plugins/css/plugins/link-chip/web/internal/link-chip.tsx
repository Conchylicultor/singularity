/**
 * A LinkChip IS a `Badge`, so its passthrough lands where Badge's does — the
 * chip shell, never the truncating label span inside it. See {@link Passthrough}.
 *
 * The openness is load-bearing, not a convenience. A chip whose click reveals
 * something IN PLACE (a popover, a tooltip) is handed to the overlay as its
 * trigger, and base-ui clones that element with its own handler, ARIA and ref.
 * A closed prop surface drops all three silently, so the chip simply stops
 * opening — which is why the two chips that needed it each worked around this
 * primitive instead of composing it: `commit-link` wrapped it in a spare
 * `Inline` to give the tooltip something clonable, and `ui-context` hand-rolled
 * the whole chip, which is where the look below comes from.

/**
 * The chip's own chrome, on top of the Badge shell.
 *
 * It reads as an OBJECT sitting in the sentence — an outlined tile you can
 * point at — rather than as a run of link text. That is deliberate, and it is a
 * reversal: the chip used to paint its label `text-primary` and underline it on
 * hover, borrowing the web's convention for a link inside prose. In a paragraph
 * that names half a dozen tasks, attempts and pages, the result was a wall of
 * accent-colored words, and the accent stopped meaning anything.
 *
 * So the affordance moved off the letters and onto the box: normal foreground
 * text, a hairline border, and a background that lifts to `accent` under the
 * pointer. The pointer cursor carries the weight the underline used to, and it
 * is not written here — the base layer gives it to every `<button>`, which is
 * what the chip is.

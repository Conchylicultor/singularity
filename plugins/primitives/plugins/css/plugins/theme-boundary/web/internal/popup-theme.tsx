 * case is a control that sits inside an app but opens part of the frame: the
 * app launcher's button lives in the app's own header, drawn in the app's
 * theme, while the app grid it opens is the chrome.
 *
 * The popup's icons follow: a floating panel draws its icons in the scope its
 * portal re-stamps (`OverlayPanel`).

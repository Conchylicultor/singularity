 * primitive exists to make unspellable, which is why the prop is required.

/**
 * The canvas each role paints, as one frozen bundle per role — the same shape
 * and the same ordering as `SURFACE_LEVELS` (background first, then the two
 * helper vars the background implies), so the two maps read as one vocabulary.
 *
 * `canvas` / `sunken` ARE `SURFACE_LEVELS` entries, read from the map rather
 * than re-spelled, so a preset swap moves a boundary and a `<Surface>` of the
 * same role together. `chrome` cannot be: `--sidebar` is its own token group
 * (`plugins/ui/plugins/tokens/plugins/sidebar-palette/`, 8 tokens with its own
 * preset picker) that a preset retints independently of `--background`, so it
 * is authored here as the complete bundle in that same shape.
 *
 * The two helper vars are not decoration — a background without them is a
 * background that lies to everything painting on it:
 *   - `--chrome-mask` is "my background, for something painting OVER me" — a
 *     sticky bar inside the boundary masks scrolled content with this
 *     (`bg-chrome-mask`) instead of the page `--background`.
 *   - `--hover-fill` is "a visible step off my background, for something
 *     highlighting INSIDE me" — a ghost `Button` hovers to `bg-hover-fill`, so
 *     without it a control dropped on the sidebar tone hovers to the page
 *     canvas's `--muted` and reads as no hover at all.
 * See the comment on `SURFACE_LEVELS` in ui-kit for the full contract.
 *
 * **The role is the ONLY way to choose a background. Never layer a `bg-*` over
 * one through `className`.** The bundle is the unit precisely because its three
 * parts have to agree, and `cn()` will happily break that agreement:
 *
 *     cn("bg-background [--chrome-mask:var(--background)]", "bg-muted/40")
 *       → "[--chrome-mask:var(--background)] bg-muted/40"
 *
 * tailwind-merge resolves the conflicting `bg-*` and drops the loser, but the
 * two helper vars are arbitrary properties with nothing to conflict WITH, so
 * they survive pointing at the tone that just left. The result is a surface
 * whose `--chrome-mask` and `--hover-fill` describe a background it no longer
 * has: a sticky bar inside it masks scrolled content with the wrong colour, and
 * a ghost control hovers to a step off a background that is not there. Both
 * fail silently and only under some presets.
 *
 * If a site seems to need a background none of the four roles offer, that is a
 * question about the role set, not a call site to patch.

 *     CSS blocks target, which is what overrides the design tokens for the

 *  2. a `PortalThemeScopeProvider` carrying the same token, so a popover or menu
 *     that portals OUT of the subtree re-stamps the attribute and keeps the
 *     theme it was opened from;
 *  3. a painted canvas, because custom properties cascade down while paint does
 *     not travel up.
 *
 * Miss (3) and you get the failure this was found by: `PaneBox` shipped with the
 * attribute and the portal forward but no paint, so a Pages pane hosted in the
 * agent manager read Pages' `--background` and painted none of it — the user saw
 * the host's canvas under Pages' text. Miss (2) and a menu opened from the app
 * rail comes back wearing the desktop theme. Every gap is invisible until a
 * screenshot.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT built on `<Surface>`, though it reads the same frozen
 * bundles: `<Surface>` bakes in `tabIndex={-1}` and a Ctrl+A select-scope, which
 * are right for a contained card and wrong for every pane, rail and tab strip.
 * Same stance ui-kit's own `OverlayPanel` takes.

/**
 * A theme boundary is THREE coordinated things, and both of the ones that are
 * hand-writable are banned here.
 *
 *  1. `data-theme-scope` on an element — the selector `theme-engine`'s emitted
 *     CSS blocks target, which re-themes the whole subtree;
 *  2. a `PortalThemeScopeProvider` carrying the same token, so content that
 *     portals OUT of the subtree re-stamps the attribute and keeps its theme;
 *  3. a painted canvas — custom properties cascade DOWN, paint does not travel
 *     UP, so a boundary that paints nothing lets an ancestor's fill show
 *     through, in the ancestor's theme.
 *
 * Written by hand, they disagree. Every site in the repo assembled a different
 * subset: `PaneBox` had (1) and (2) and no paint, so a Pages pane hosted in the
 * agent manager read Pages' `--background` and painted none of it — the user saw
 * the host's canvas. The app rail had (1) and (3) and no portal forward, so a
 * menu opened from it came back wearing the desktop theme. Each gap is silent
 * until a screenshot.
 *
 * `<Theme name surface>` owns all three, and `surface` is REQUIRED — so the
 * half-built boundary has no spelling. This rule closes the two ways back to
 * hand-assembly:
 *
 *   - `adhocThemeScope` — a raw `data-theme-scope` JSX attribute, on ANY host
 *     element. No tag gate on purpose: a tag allowlist fails open (its siblings
 *     `no-adhoc-surface` and `no-adhoc-viewport-overlay` both deleted theirs
 *     after a `<section>` / a layout component's `className` sailed past). The
 *     attribute's IDENTITY is the whole fingerprint, structurally the check
 *     `no-orphan-composite-role` makes on `role=`.
 *   - `adhocPortalThemeScope` — importing `PortalThemeScopeProvider`. Keyed on
 *     the imported NAME rather than the module path: exactly one symbol in the
 *     repo carries it (ui-kit's `web/components/portal-theme-scope.tsx`,
 *     re-exported from the ui-kit barrel), so a deep path or a re-export cannot
 *     fail open. Reading the forwarded scope (`usePortalThemeScope`) is a read,
 *     not a boundary declaration, and is left alone.
 *
 * No autofix. Choosing which of the four `surface` roles a site paints is the
 * judgement the primitive exists to force, and it is exactly what cannot be
 * mechanized: the old sites' paint is where the bugs are (two of them were
 * wrong), so copying it forward is not a safe transform.
 *
 * The primitive's own files are exempted by path in `lint/index.ts` — they ARE
 * the implementation of both halves.

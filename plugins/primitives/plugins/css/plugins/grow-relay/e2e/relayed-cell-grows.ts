/**
 * The geometry gate jsdom cannot give: in a real layout engine, does the box
 * hosting a slot-rendered `AdaptiveBar` actually end up growing — with nothing
 * declared on the contribution?
 *
 * Drives the conversation prompt row, whose template-chip strip is one of the
 * two slot-hosted bars in the repo (the other, Sonata's display picker, needs a
 * saved song to reach). Walks up from the bar and asserts in the browser's own
 * words: the bar declares itself the grow cell, at least one ancestor box
 * relayed that grow, and the bar ended up wider than the chips it decided to
 * render — a shrink-wrapping chain reports those last two equal, which is the
 * ratchet this primitive exists to prevent.
 *
 * Manual, like every `e2e/` script here:
 *
 *   bun plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/grow-relay/e2e/relayed-cell-grows.ts \
 *     --conv <conversationId> [--headed]

 * un-grown box, since a `setState` from a child's layout effect flushes after
 * every layout effect of that commit. It is true only once every relay between
 * the requester and its row has actually applied the grow.
 *
 * `relays` is how many of them there were, and it is diagnosis rather than

 * this primitive can see relayed, so a box that swallows the grow is one it

/**
 * A box between a requester and its row. Grows when something under it asks,

 *
 * Renders no DOM of its own — the render prop hands the answer to whatever box
 * the consumer already owns:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <GrowRelay>
 *   {(growing) => (
 *     <div className={cn("flex min-w-0", growing && "flex-1")}>{children}</div>
 *   )}
 * </GrowRelay>
 * ```
 *
 * The render prop is deliberate for the same reason `PopupOpenScope`'s is:
 * providing the context and reading the aggregate are ONE component, so a
 * consumer cannot wire half of it — a relay nobody reads, or a reader with no
 * relay, would both look fine at author time.
 *
 * **Render the same element either way — only its classes may change.** Growing
 * is a styling answer, so a consumer that swaps the element (or its React type)
 * on `growing` unmounts everything under it, which releases the very ask that
 * made it grow, which un-grows it, which mounts it all back: the one way to hang
 * a page with this API. Pinned in `web/__tests__/grow-relay.test.tsx`.
 *
 * **It forwards even while growing.** `flex-1` yields pixels only if the box's
 * own parent has slack to share, so a relay that stopped here would fix one
 * link of the chain and leave the next one broken — which is the exact shape of
 * the bug this primitive replaces.
 *
 * A box that is **not** a relay is transparent, not a break: React context
 * passes straight through a plain `<div>`, so nothing between here and the
 * requester has to opt in. Such a box still fails to grow ITSELF, which no
 * bookkeeping can fix and which the requester's own runtime guard
 * (`adaptive-bar`'s `no-slack` probe) is there to catch. So wrap a box in a
 * relay only when the box can actually answer — a box that generates none
 * (`display: contents`) should stay out of the chain, or it inflates `relays`
 * with a link that applied nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here is measured, so nothing can oscillate: `growing` counts MOUNTED
 * requesters, and no answer the requester computes from its new width can add
 * or remove one.

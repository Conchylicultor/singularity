// ── The one child kit every region is measured against ──────────────
//
// This kit is NOT authorable by the fixture, and that is the entire mechanism.
//
// Every `LayoutFixture` renders children it wrote itself, so a container is only
// ever measured against the child kind it already handles. `control-panel` shows
// what that costs: five fixtures, all green, all rendering `Row`s — while a raw
// `<Input>` dropped into a panel sat ~50px left of every label around it. Three
// geometry bugs shipped that way, and the remedy on the books was a sentence in
// a CLAUDE.md asking authors to please render something other than a `Row`. A
// sentence is rung 5 of the fix ladder; this file is rung 1, because a region
// fixture has nowhere to say what its children are.
//
// So a member is added HERE, once, and every region in the repo is re-gated by
// it — including the ones contributed before the member existed. Adding a kind
// of child that regions get wrong is how this gate grows teeth over time.
//
// ### What belongs in the kit
//
// Children that know NOTHING about the rail. A child that opts in (a rail class,
// a wrapper that re-insets) proves nothing: it would land correctly against a
// region that published a wrong number, because it would be reading the same
// wrong number. The one exception is deliberate and named — `bled-row` exercises
// the escape hatch, whose whole contract is that cancel-and-reapply lands the
// content back on exactly the rail it cancelled.

/**
 * The measurement box a member is marked on.
 *
 * `data-geo` cannot go on the component itself: an `<Input>` has its own border
 * and inline padding, so its CONTENT edge sits ~13px inside its box and the slot
 * would read a rail that is 13px off for no reason a region could fix. The probe
 * is a padding-free, border-free block that fills the region's inline axis, so
 * its content edge IS its left edge IS the child's box edge — the same reason
 * `control-panel`'s fixtures measure through a `Fills` wrapper.
 *
 * It is layout-transparent in both region shapes: in a flex/grid column it is
 * one item like the child would have been, and in a block region a block box
 * fills the width anyway.

    // applies the inset a second time; 24px silently becomes 48px. That is why
    // the rail publishes a second pair, `--rail-owed-*` — what a follower still

// THE generic geometry suite. It builds the measurer page once (Vite + React +
// real Tailwind), opens one headless Chromium, and sweeps the WHOLE fixture
// catalog: for each fixture it measures every `widths` entry, then evaluates
// each invariant via the pure oracle. `falsification` invariants are handled
// specially — re-measured with the mutation applied, then asserted VIOLATED, so
// the harness is proven to bite on the historical broken construct.
//
// jsdom can't lay out CSS grid or compute text overflow, so this drives a real
// browser (same approach as the bespoke frame/truncating-text geometry tests it
// supersedes). It launches Vite + Chromium and is therefore slow — that's
// expected; it gates behind the sig-cached `layout-geometry` check.

// bun:test registers tests synchronously, but loadFixtures is async. Await it
// once at module top-level so the per-fixture describes below are registered
// before the run starts.
//
// `expandRegionFixtures` turns each contributed REGION (a fixture that hands the
// harness a hole instead of a child list) into an ordinary layout fixture
// rendering the whole `REGION_CHILDREN` kit, with its invariants supplied by the
// expansion. The suite below is unchanged by the new fixture kind — it still
// sweeps widths and evaluates invariants — which is the point of expanding here
// rather than teaching every consumer a second shape.

 * This suite's own budget, declared here rather than left to whoever runs it.

 * bun:test's default is 5s per hook and per test, and the setup below — a cold
 * Vite build, a cold headless Chromium launch, a page load — routinely runs
 * longer than that even on an idle machine, let alone a host running several
 * worktree servers. The `layout-geometry` check passes `--timeout 120000` for
 * exactly this reason, but a flag on one caller is not a property of the suite:
 * running it the ordinary way (`./singularity test <this plugin>`) blew the
 * default budget and reported a hook timeout that had nothing to do with
 * geometry. A suite that only passes when invoked with the right flag is a
 * suite with a trap in it, so the budget lives with the code that needs it and
 * the check's flag is now belt-and-braces.

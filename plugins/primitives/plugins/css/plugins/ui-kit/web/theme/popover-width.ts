// Single source of truth for the popover width + padding roles. Each is a named
// role mapped to a class via a module-level `Record<Name, string>` indexed by a
// plain prop — mirroring `SURFACE_LEVELS` (theme/surface.ts), no Context.
//
// Co-located in ui-kit (not the `popover` primitive) on purpose: the foundational
// `PopoverContent` consumes these maps directly, and ui-kit is the lowest layer —
// putting the maps here lets it read them without a layer-inverting import cycle,
// while the `popover` primitive (a ui-kit consumer) imports the types
// boundary-legally through the ui-kit barrel.
//
// Width is a CLOSED ramp so a magic Tailwind width can't be sprinkled per call
// site (double-declaration / overflow becomes unrepresentable). `content` is the
// default — size-to-content, matching base-ui's native behavior. Every non-content
// token also carries `max-w-(--available-width)` (base-ui's Positioner exposes the
// CSS var on the popup, same as dropdown-menu.tsx) so no popover overflows a narrow
// viewport. Padding is its own axis, mapped to the `rail-*` @utility classes owned
// by app.css, defaulting to `md` (preserves PopoverContent's previously baked-in padding).
//
// `fit` is the role for a popover whose content has a VARIABLE but bounded natural
// width (e.g. a filter-rule row: `[field] [operator] [value-control]`). It grows to
// its content (`w-max`) with a comfortable `min-w` floor and the same viewport cap.
// Use it instead of a fixed `w-*` whenever a rigid child (a Button/Select trigger
// that can't shrink) would otherwise be clipped when it doesn't fit the fixed box —
// a fixed width can never hold a row of unbounded natural width without overflow.
//
// Three roles size a panel RELATIVE TO ITS TRIGGER rather than to a tier:
//
//   - `anchor` — exactly the trigger's width (a listbox: the closed control and the
//     open list are the same box, so the selected row lands where the value was).
//   - `anchor-min` — at least the trigger's width, growing past it for longer item
//     labels (a menu: the trigger is a floor, not a cap).
//   - `snug` — no meaningful anchor at all (a submenu, whose "trigger" is one row of
//     its parent menu): size to content over a small floor.
//
// Both anchor roles read `--anchor-width` WITH AN IN-VAR FALLBACK, for the same
// reason `--available-height` carries one below: the var only exists once a
// positioner's `size.apply` has run, and an undefined var invalidates the whole
// `max()` at computed-value time — which would silently drop the 8rem floor, not
// just the anchor term. Surfaces that publish no anchor at all (a dialog) then
// degrade to the floor rather than to nothing.

// Two roles size a panel by WHAT IT IS rather than by a tier — the control-panel
// vocabulary's only width dial (`ControlPanelPopover size`). `menu` is a list of
// choices; `builder` is a six-track rule row. They are new roles rather than
// aliases of `md` (256px) / `3xl` (480px) on purpose: reusing a t-shirt size
// re-imports the thing the vocabulary exists to delete — a panel width chosen
// because some measurement was nearby, which is how the filter panel ended up
// 481px wide (its FOOTER was the widest row) and resized every time a rule was
// added. The ramp already carries role names beside its sizes (`fit`, `snug`,
// `anchor`, `anchor-min`); these two join them.

// A padding role is ONE `rail-<step>` class, not a padding class plus a
// hand-written co-publication of its value. Applying an inset IS opening a region
// (the rail contract, in app.css): `rail-<step>` pads AND publishes the four
// `--rail-*` vars in the same declaration, so the number exists exactly once and a
// descendant can read the panel's real inset. The pair that used to be spelled
// `p-<step> [--scroll-pad:…]` here is now a property of the shared contract rather
// than of this file.
//
// The reason the value must be readable to CSS is unchanged. `scroll-fade`
// (app.css) is the one consumer today: its sticky edge strips resolve their insets
// against the panel's CONTENT box, so without the value they park `padding-block`
// short of the panel's inner edges — and scrolled content, which does pass through
// that padding strip, re-emerges UNFADED there. It now reads `--rail-block-start` /
// `--rail-block-end` per edge, which is strictly better than the single
// `--scroll-pad` it replaced: one value for both edges was silently wrong the
// moment a role's block padding stopped being symmetric.
//
// Every step publishes, `none` included: custom properties INHERIT, so a `none`
// panel whose class published nothing would pick up an ENCLOSING panel's inset and
// offset its fade past its own edge. `rail-none` publishes zeros like every other
// step, so that hole cannot be reopened one role at a time.

// Max-height is its own axis, co-located with width/padding. The contract in one
// line: THE PANEL ALWAYS FITS THE VIEWPORT, AND THE ROLE IS A COMFORT CAP ON TOP
// OF THAT. `--available-height` — the space Floating UI measured between the
// anchor and the collision boundary (published by base-ui's Positioner, and by
// `FloatingSurface`'s own `size` middleware) — is the floor every role shares;
// `viewport` is that floor alone, and a named role only ever makes the panel
// SHORTER than the space it has, never taller. There is no opt-out: a panel that
// outgrows the viewport with no clamp puts its tail permanently out of reach,
// which is the entire bug class this axis exists to prevent.
//
// Three details that are load-bearing, not cosmetic:
//
//   - ONE `max-h` class per role — a clamp, never a clamp PLUS a cap. Two classes
//     in the same tailwind-merge group only compose correctly while nobody
//     touches their order; `min(cap, var(--available-height))` folds both into a
//     single class, so a caller's `className` override still resolves cleanly.
//   - The `100vh` IN-VAR fallback is required, not defensive. `--available-height`
//     does not exist until Floating UI's `size.apply` has run once, and an
//     undefined var invalidates the WHOLE `min()` at computed-value time →
//     `max-height: none` → one full-height frame on first paint.
//   - `overflow-y-auto` deliberately does NOT live here. Scrolling is an
//     unconditional invariant of the panel — owned by `OverlayPanel` (and the
//     `PopoverContent` / `FloatingSurface` roots it backs) — not something a role
//     can switch off. A clamp without a scroller is exactly the unreachable tail
//     again, so the two must never be separable at a call site.

// THE MENU ROW — one visual definition for every menu row in the app: the
// dropdown's items and sub-trigger, `SelectItem`, and `ControlPanel.Row`. Every
// one of them composes these lists instead of spelling its own, so the menus
// match and cannot drift. A new menu-like row applies them too.
//
// Two halves, read together: these class lists (every overridable SINGLE
// property, each a class twMerge classifies, so a caller's `className` replaces
// exactly the one it names — `gap-lg` on a picker pill's row), and the
// `menu-row` / `menu-row-lit` utilities in `app.css` (the states: tone vars,
// checked, destructive, icon tone, and the highlighted paint). Geometry is
// global; every colour is a theme token, so each app draws the same shape in
// its own colours.
//
// The highlight is wired by each component to ITS state model, because there
// are three: base-ui's `data-highlighted` (and `data-popup-open` on a submenu's
// trigger), and a control-panel row's `:hover`. See `app.css` for why that is a
// variant on one utility rather than a selector list ui-kit would have to keep
// in step with control-panel's DOM.

 * The row's PAINT: state layer, type role (`label`: size, line-height, medium

 *
 * Arbitrary `[&[data-…]]` variants, not `data-checked:`: this repo's

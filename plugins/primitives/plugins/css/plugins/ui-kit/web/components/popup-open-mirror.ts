/**
 * Publishes a base-ui `Root`'s open state to the enclosing `PopupOpenScope`.
 *
 * This is the ONLY place in the repo that reads a popup library's open state on
 * behalf of surrounding chrome — consumers get the typed boolean out of
 * `PopupOpenScope` instead of a CSS selector naming base-ui's `data-popup-open`
 * attribute (which is how the previous, dead Radix spelling rotted unnoticed).
 *
 * Returns the `onOpenChange` to hand back to the `Root`. The caller's handler is
 * invoked with EVERY argument base-ui passed — the signature is
 * `(open, eventDetails)` today and the spread keeps this wrapper transparent to
 * whatever it becomes.

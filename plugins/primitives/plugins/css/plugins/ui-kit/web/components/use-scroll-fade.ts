/**
 * The measurement half of the `scroll-fade` utility (app.css): tells a scroller
 * whether there is more content above / below what it is currently showing.
 *
 * The paint is pure CSS — two sticky pseudo-elements gated on `data-fade-top` /
 * `data-fade-bottom`. All this hook decides is when those attributes are on, and
 * the ONLY honest answer is a measurement: a fade that is always on claims
 * content that isn't there, which is worse than no signal at all.
 *
 * Three signals feed it, because scroll alone is not enough — the "Turn into"
 * and `/` block menus filter their lists as the user types, so scrollable-ness
 * changes with no scroll event ever firing:
 *
 *  1. **scroll** — the returned `onScroll`.
 *  2. **resize** — a `ResizeObserver` on the scroller (through the sanctioned
 *     `element-size` primitive). A clamped panel whose list filters down shrinks;
 *     one that refills grows back. This is the filter case.
 *  3. **every commit** — a layout effect with no dependency list. It closes the
 *     gap the other two leave: content appended while the box is ALREADY at its
 *     height cap changes `scrollHeight` without resizing the box or moving the
 *     scroll position. Commit-driven, not a poll, and the setter bails out on an
 *     unchanged pair so it can never loop.
 *
 * The node is held in state rather than a ref (the `useElementSize` precedent):
 * the measurement is render-visible, so it must re-subscribe the observer when
 * the node changes.

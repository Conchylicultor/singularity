          answers yes to every press in the window, which is why this dialog

        {/* The dialog's box IS the shared panel — see `overlay-panel.tsx`. A
            dialog is CENTERED rather than anchored, so nothing positions it and
            no positioner publishes an `--available-height` for it; the popup
            above declares one from its own offset, which is what turns the
            panel's unconditional clamp into "as tall as the room actually
            left". Width comes from the popup too (`DIALOG_SIZES`) and the panel
            simply fills it: `POPOVER_WIDTH.content` (the default role) is the
            empty string, so the `w-full` here is unopposed.

            `padding="lg"` is FIXED, and there is no `padded` prop to switch it
            off: the panel owns the region's edge, so it owns the rail (see the
            rail contract in app.css). A flush caller does not turn the region
            off — the child that must reach the panel edge (a header band's
            rule, a footer's) says so itself with `rail-bleed`, which cancels
            and re-applies the rail as one indivisible act, so its content stays
            on the same rail as everything else. Absent-from-the-type rather
            than defaulted-in-it is the same move `ControlPanelPopover` makes
            with `width`: an escape that has no spelling cannot be reached for
            by accident.

            Two caveats before reaching for it. Bleed only a DIRECT child of the
            panel: the panel's own `overflow-x-hidden` is what makes a bleed free
            — inside a nested `ScrollArea` (viewport `overflow: scroll` on both
            axes) the same class buys sideways scroll instead of a wider box. And
            never put it in this component's own `className`, however much it
            looks like the replacement for the old `padded={false}`:
            `rail-bleed` is `extend px`, so it would REMOVE the `rail-lg` below
            it, leaving the panel un-inset (the intended half) and also bleeding
            against a rail that is now zero. */}

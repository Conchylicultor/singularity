// OverlayPanel's scroll-edge fade — the "there is more below" signal.
//
// The claim under test is narrow and easy to fake, so every assertion reads the
// SAME element three ways: the panel's own scroll metrics (is there really more
// content that way?), the painted `::before`/`::after` opacity (is the gradient
// actually on?), and the PIXELS at each edge (did it land where the user would
// see it, and does it dissolve rather than cut off?). A fade that is always on
// would satisfy the second alone; a data attribute nobody styled would satisfy
// the first alone; a strip painted at full opacity outside the visible box
// satisfied both, and shipped.
//
// Two assertions are about the mechanism rather than any one state, and run
// wherever they apply:
//
//  - **no scrollable extent** — the panel re-measured with `scroll-fade` off must
//    report the same `scrollHeight`. This is what "the fade never lies" reduces
//    to; a strip contributing even 4px makes a menu that fits paint a fade over
//    nothing.
//  - **painted geometry** — how far from the padded edge the content underneath
//    first shows through, bounded on both sides (see `edgeGeometry`).
//
// Four states, all driven on a throwaway page this script creates itself:
//
//  1. "Turn into" block menu at rest — bottom fade ON, top fade OFF.
//  2. The same menu scrolled into the middle — BOTH on.
//  3. The same menu scrolled to the end — top ON, bottom OFF.
//  4. The `/` slash menu filtered down until the list fits — NEITHER on.

 * reports what it was given, not where it was painted. A top strip that was
 * fully opaque AND positioned outside the visible box once passed every
 * assertion in this file; only a screenshot caught it. So this reads pixels.
 *
 * It reads them TWICE — once as shipped, once with `scroll-fade` removed — and
 * reports per-distance COVERAGE: how much the strip attenuates whatever is
 * underneath, `1 - faded/bare`. The second sample is not a luxury. The obvious
 * measurement, "how far in does content first appear", conflates *masked* with
 * *nothing there*: a menu row is mostly leading, so ~9px bands of bare
 * background sit between glyph rows, and the number then swings by half a row
 * depending on where a row boundary happens to land. Against its own unmasked
 * control, the same pixels answer the actual question.
 *
 * Two failure modes, one profile:
 *
 *  - **uncovered at the edge** ⇒ either the strip isn't there, or it parks short
 *    of the padded edge and leaves the unfaded sliver the `box-shadow` bleed
 *    exists to cover.
 *  - **still covered late in the ramp** ⇒ a CUTOFF, not a fade: the row under it
 *    is simply hidden rather than visibly dissolving, which is the whole point of
 *    a gradient.
 *
 * Both edges come out of ONE pair of screenshots, because restoring the class
 * restarts the strips' 120ms fade-in — a second capture would sample a
 * half-opaque strip and understate its coverage.
 *
 * `--chrome-mask` is never parsed: the reference background is SAMPLED, from a

 *  1. **the gate + held geometry** — the interaction has taken effect, and
 *     `scrollTop`/`clientHeight`/`scrollHeight` are unchanged across two
 *     consecutive frames (a wheel scroll is animated; a filtered list reflows).
 *  2. **attributes agree with metrics** — React has committed. Bounded, so a
 *     hook that measured wrong never satisfies it and the wait fails loudly
 *     rather than the assertion reading a stale attribute.
 *  3. **no fade transition is running** — `getAnimations` reports the paint has
 *     finished moving. A CSS transition is dropped once it finishes, so an empty
 *     set is "arrived", and a fade whose CSS never matched arms no transition at

  // scroller and writes `height:100%` / `max-height:100%` down the chain, so the
  // PANEL never overflows and its fade never arms — Select keeps its own scroll
  // arrows with no double affordance. The pseudo-elements are new children of
  // that panel, so this is also the percentage chain's regression test.
  // Escape closes the menu but leaves the query text ("/quo") in the block, so
  // the block must be emptied first — otherwise the next query reads
  // "quo/code", matches nothing, and Enter inserts no code block at all. (That
  // was the real reason this section used to time out on the language picker:
  // the trigger was never in the DOM.)

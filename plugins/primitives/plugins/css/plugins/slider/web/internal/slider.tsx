 * The thin-track slider: a themed `<input type="range">`.

 * It exists because the recipe underneath it — strip the UA appearance, paint a
 * 3px track, a gradient fill for WebKit and a real progress element for
 * Firefox, a focus ring reached through two vendor pseudo-elements — is forty
 * lines of CSS that was being copied per call site. And because two of the
 * things that recipe needs are decisions no call site should be making.
 *
 * **The fill is normalized here.** Every copy of this used to write
 * `--fill: value * 100` inline, which is the right number only because both
 * their ranges happened to be 0–1: correct twice, by coincidence. The first
 * slider with any other range would have painted a filled portion that
 * disagreed with its own thumb, and nothing would have said so. The percentage
 * is a function of `(value, min, max)`, so it is computed in the one place all
 * three are known.
 *
 * **The detent is here too**, for the same reason from the other side: putting
 * a tick at a value means positioning against the track's own geometry, which
 * is knowledge belonging to whoever wrote the track — not to a feature that
 * just wants a fader with a home position.
 *
 * The passthrough and `ref` land on the input, which is the control: that is
 * where a caller's `disabled`, `title`, pointer handlers or `data-*` selector
 * target want to be. `className` is routed to the wrapper instead, because the
 * wrapper is the box — it is what a caller is sizing when they write `w-24`.
 * The wrapper is rendered whether or not there is a detent, so that routing
 * never moves.

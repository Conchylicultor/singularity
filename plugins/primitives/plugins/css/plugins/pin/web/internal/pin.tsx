 * The color is `var(--scrim, var(--chrome-mask))` — the surface's published
 * background by default, with `--scrim` the override a surface that paints a
 * TRANSIENT tint over that background (a hovered/selected row, an interactive
 * card) republishes so the scrim matches what is actually on screen at reveal
 * time. It is deliberately a second property rather than a `--chrome-mask`
 * re-declaration: a row's tint is a composite *over* the ambient mask
 * (`color-mix(… , var(--chrome-mask))`), and a property whose value reads itself
 * is a cycle CSS resolves to nothing. The `var(…, …)` fallback — never a `:root`
 * default — is also what keeps it correct inside a forked theme scope, for the
 * reason app.css documents for `--chrome-mask` itself.
 *
 * The offset is re-expressed as PADDING (the caller's `to`/`offset` still read as
 * "inset from that edge") because a scrim inset from the edge it hides against
 * leaves a sliver of live content showing in the gap. `borderRadius: inherit`
 * keeps it inside a rounded row/card's corners.

/**

 *
 * `absolute` + the stacking layer are always classes. Per anchor:
 * - **corners** pin both adjacent edges via inline-style insets (no class).
 * - **edge-centers** pin that edge (inline style) and, on the perpendicular axis,
 *   either center it (`left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` — pure Tailwind classes) or, when
 *   `stretch`, span it full-length (`inset-x-0` / `inset-y-0`).
 * - **center** is the four-class translate centering trick; `offset` is ignored.
 *
 * The translate/`1/2` centering mechanics are pure Tailwind classes that live
 * inside this exempt primitive so callers never write them.
 *
 * `mask` layers the scrim on top (see {@link scrimDecor}) and changes two of the
 * mechanics, because a scrim that does not reach the edges it hides against is
 * not a scrim: the anchor insets collapse to `0` (the offset becomes padding),
 * and an edge-center anchor spans its perpendicular axis — a hovered row's actions
 * must cover the row's whole height, not just the button cluster's box — with its
 * content centered on that axis exactly as the non-stretch anchor would place it.

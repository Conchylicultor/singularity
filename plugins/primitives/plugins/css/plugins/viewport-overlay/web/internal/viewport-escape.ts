/**
 * A box that says `fixed inset-0` to mean "fill the viewport" expects two things
 * of its ancestor chain: that it covers the whole WINDOW, and that it paints
 * over the chrome beside it. Both are properties of elements ABOVE it rather
 * than of the box itself, and each has its own way of quietly failing:
 *
 *  - **containing block** — a `transform` / `filter` / `contain` anywhere up to
 *    `<html>` makes that element the containing block for fixed descendants, so
 *    the box stops at that element's content area instead of the viewport.
 *    (This is exactly what a `transform-gpu` on a surface backdrop does, which
 *    is why such a surface drops it while a viewport-relative placement is
 *    active.)
 *  - **stacking context** — `z-overlay` (40) only beats a rail's `z-nav` (20)
 *    because the two numbers are compared in the SAME stacking context. An
 *    ancestor that opens a new one — `opacity` below 1, `isolation: isolate`, a
 *    blend mode, a positioned element with a numeric `z-index` — traps the box
 *    inside it, and it stops covering that chrome while its geometry still looks
 *    perfectly right.
 *
 * Neither is expressible in CSS, and neither is visible to lint: the chain
 * crosses plugin boundaries and only exists once rendered. So it is checked at
 * runtime, the moment the box starts mattering, and it fails loudly — because
 * both failures look *almost* correct, which is how they survive review.
 *
 * The stacking half is deliberately conservative: a new stacking context on an
 * ancestor the chrome ALSO sits inside would in fact be harmless, but the check
 * cannot know which chrome a given caller has to cover. A loud false positive is
 * a five-minute conversation; the silent version is a bug report that says
 * "fullscreen looks fine".
 *
 * Everything below the {@link ViewportEscapeOptions} boundary is pure CSS: it
 * names no app, no surface and no placement. The one piece of domain knowledge —
 * WHAT breaks and what to do instead — is a string the caller supplies.

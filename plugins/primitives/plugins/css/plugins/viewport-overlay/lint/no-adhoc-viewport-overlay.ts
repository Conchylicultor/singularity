/**
 * A hand-rolled `fixed inset-0` div means "fill the viewport" — but several app
 * surfaces deliberately put `transform-gpu` (or another transform / filter /
 * will-change) on a container to scope `position: fixed` app chrome. Any
 * `fixed inset-0` descendant of such a container is then bounded by it and
 * SILENTLY clipped to the content area (below the tab bar, right of the rail),
 * with no error — it only shows up as a wrong-looking screenshot. The ancestor
 * relationship is a runtime DOM fact that crosses plugin boundaries, so it can't
 * be checked statically; instead we fingerprint the viewport-fill recipe and
 * redirect it to the `<ViewportOverlay>` primitive, which self-portals to
 * `document.body` and is therefore correct regardless of any transformed
 * ancestor.
 *
 * Fingerprint: the co-occurrence of `fixed` + `inset-0`, aggregated across one
 * class-name attribute (the tokens may live in different `cn()` fragments) or
 * one `cn`/`clsx`/`twMerge` call. Both anchors matter — the recipe is just as
 * wrong when it is built into a `const c = cn("fixed", "inset-0")` and spread
 * onto an element a few lines later.
 *
 * The gate is the *recipe*, not the host tag. The literal recipe is illegal on
 * ANY host element — an intrinsic (`<div>`/`<section>`/`<main>`/`<nav>`/…), a
 * capitalized layout component, or a member-expression tag (`<Foo.Bar>`). The
 * former `HOST_TAGS` gate was `span`/`div`/`button`/`a`, so `<section className=
 * "fixed inset-0">` sailed past it — a tag-allowlist fails open, and its sibling
 * `no-adhoc-surface` already deleted its identical gate for that reason.
 *
 * Two legitimate homes for the recipe survive that, both by construction rather
 * than by an allowlist of tags:
 *
 *   1. The primitive itself keeps the recipe in a module const, so it is opaque
 *      to the literal-only token walk below.
 *   2. The base-ui `*.Popup` / `*.Backdrop` tags in the shadcn dialog/sheet DO
 *      fill the real viewport correctly — base-ui portals them — but they spell
 *      the recipe as literals, so they are exempted by a file-glob in
 *      `lint/index.ts`, exactly as `no-adhoc-surface` exempts the same files.
 *
 * No auto-fix: deciding viewport (`<ViewportOverlay>`) vs. pane-relative
 * (`absolute inset-0`) is a per-site judgement (same stance as
 * `no-adhoc-surface` / `no-adhoc-zindex`).

/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-viewport-overlay` lint rule. Run with `bun test` from
 * the repo root (or this file's directory).
 *
 * The rule fingerprints the viewport-fill recipe (`fixed` + `inset-0`) and
 * redirects it to `<ViewportOverlay>`. The gate is the recipe, not the host tag:
 * it fires on ANY element and in any `cn`/`clsx`/`twMerge` call, and only when
 * BOTH `fixed` and `inset-0` are present (pane-relative `absolute inset-0` and
 * partial `fixed` positioning are left alone). What stays invisible is a class
 * string the literal-only walk cannot read — a module const or a helper's return
 * value — which is the escape valve the primitive itself uses.

/**
 * The inline-level sibling of `Stack` — an `inline-flex` flow row for chips, icons,
 * and small affordances that must sit INLINE in a text run, flowing with the
 * surrounding text rather than breaking the line. The home for the
 * `inline-flex … align-baseline` recipe that otherwise scatters as eslint-disabled
 * raw layout in feature code.
 *
 * It DELEGATES to `Stack` (exactly as `Cluster` does) so the gap ramp and
 * align/justify semantics live in exactly one place. The only thing it changes is
 * the display mode:
 *
 *   - `inline-flex` overrides Stack's block-level `flex` (tailwind-merge resolves
 *     the `display` group, so the later class wins) — inline-level without
 *     re-implementing the ramp.
 *   - `align-baseline` (`vertical-align: baseline`) seats the box on the surrounding
 *     text baseline — the same recipe `Badge` uses for inline-in-text chips.
 *
 * Deliberately carries NO `min-w-0`: the box constrains itself with `max-w-full`
 * (in `className`) and the truncation LEAF inside owns `min-w-0`, keeping the
 * "exactly one primitive owns `min-w-0`" invariant intact.
 *
 * Caller `className` composes last.

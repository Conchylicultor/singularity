/**
 * The custom-property names a region publishes. Nothing else — no values, no
 * resolver, no React.
 *
 * The utilities that DECLARE these (`rail-<step>` / `rail-x-` / `rail-y-` /
 * `rail-owe-`, plus `rail-bleed` and `rail-follow` which read them) live in
 * ui-kit's `app.css`, because that is the single home for every `@utility` in
 * the project. What a name is spelled cannot live there too: a
 * `getComputedStyle` read or a `style={{…}}` publication has to pass the string,
 * and a string typed out at each site is a rename that silently half-lands. So
 * the CSS owns the behaviour and this owns the spelling, joined by these.

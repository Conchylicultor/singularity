/**
 * A panel is never bled.
 *
 * A floating panel surface IS the region — its `padding` role is literally a
 * `rail-<step>` — so cancelling its own rail is always a mistake, whoever writes
 * it. That total-ness is what makes this a rule rather than a heuristic: there
 * is no context in which `<DialogContent className="rail-bleed">` is correct.
 *
 * **Why anyone reaches for it.** `DialogContent.padded` was deleted, correctly —
 * an escape absent from the type cannot be reached for. The muscle-memory
 * replacement is `className="rail-bleed"`, and it half-works, which is worse
 * than failing: `className` lands last, `rail-bleed` is in the `px` twmerge
 * group, so it STRIPS the panel's `rail-lg`. The panel loses its inset (visibly
 * what the author wanted) while simultaneously acquiring negative inline margins
 * and `width: calc(100% + 0px)` against a rail that is now zero. It looks
 * approximately right in a screenshot and is wrong in the DOM — and every
 * descendant that follows or bleeds the rail now reads `0px`.
 *
 * The fix is always one level in: a BAND inside the panel bleeds — a header
 * strip, a hairline, a row whose fill must reach the panel edge — and the panel
 * keeps its region. That is the shape `quick-find`, `command-palette` and
 * `version-history` were all migrated to.
 *
 * **Conservative by construction**, because it runs repo-wide as `error`:
 *
 *   - it matches only the panel-surface element NAMES below — the closed set of
 *     boxes that own a padding role — never an arbitrary component that happens
 *     to take a `className`;
 *   - it matches only a literal `rail-bleed` TOKEN in a class expression. A
 *     class routed through a `const` or a lookup map is out of scope, the same
 *     trade `no-adhoc-panel-body` makes and for the same reason: this closes the
 *     shape people actually write.
 *
 * Name-based matching with no cross-file type resolution is the house
 * convention (`no-adhoc-row-list` documents the trade): an aliased import
 * evading it is accepted, not a gap.
 *
 * Escape hatch per-site, travelling with the code:
 *
 *   // eslint-disable-next-line rail/no-panel-bleed -- <reason>
 */

/**

 * any future sibling are covered without an edit; the rest are named.

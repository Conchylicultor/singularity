/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-typography` lint rule. Run with `bun test`:
 *
 *   bun test plugins/primitives/plugins/text/lint/no-adhoc-typography.test.ts
 *
 * The focus is the hardened class-token walk's MAPS-ONLY alias resolution: a
 * banned `text-*`/`leading-*` parked in an object/array-literal MAP indexed
 * directly in a class context (e.g. `cn(TONE[tone])`, `styles.title`) must be
 * flagged (the regression guard), while a bare string `const`, an intermediate-
 * local map indirection, doc-strings, sanctioned sub-scale classes, and param-
 * passed classNames (no in-file initializer) must NOT be.

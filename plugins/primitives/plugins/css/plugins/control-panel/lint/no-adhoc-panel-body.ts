/**
 * Control-panel body guardrail.
 *
 * A data-control panel — the body of a Filter, Sort or view-settings popover —
 * is drawn with the `control-panel` vocabulary, where the CONTAINER separates
 * its children. An author never places a divider, so the rhythm cannot go ragged
 * one panel at a time and a conditionally-null section leaves no orphan rule.
 *
 * The rule watches four ways a hand-rolled panel body announces itself. The
 * first three are about SECTIONING, because sectioning is empirically how every
 * one of these panels drifted:
 *
 *   A. a `DropdownMenuSeparator` borrowed outside a dropdown menu. It is a menu
 *      part; a panel that reaches for it is sectioning by hand with the nearest
 *      divider it could find.
 *   B. a `<Separator>` inside a floating panel surface — the "switch to the
 *      generic divider to dodge signal A" move, which is the same decision.
 *   C. a hairline built out of raw utilities (`h-px` + a `bg-border` token) —
 *      the same divider, hand-drawn.
 *
 * The fourth closes a different fork — TWO HOSTS for one body:
 *
 *   D. a `<ControlPanel>` whose nearest hosting surface is a generic floating
 *      one (`InlinePopover`, `PopoverContent`, `DropdownMenu*Content`, …) rather
 *      than `ControlPanelPopover`. This is not a style preference: the panel body
 *      owns the content inset and the full-bleed hairlines, and it can only do
 *      that when the surface contributes NO padding of its own. A generic host
 *      brings its own padding role, so the same body draws at two different
 *      insets depending on who opened it — which is exactly how the migrated
 *      panels silently lost their edge inset (`InlinePopover` defaults to
 *      `padding="md"`, `ControlPanelPopover` sets `padding="none"`). A
 *      `DialogContent` host stays legal: a dialog is the documented second home
 *      for a bare `<ControlPanel>`, inheriting the dialog's own width.
 *
 * **Honest about coverage.** A body assembled from `Stack` + `SectionLabel` +
 * `Button` with no divider at all is invisible here. This closes the DRIFT
 * signals — borrowed dividers and hand-rolled hairlines — not the whole class.
 * The allowlist in `lint/index.ts` is the rest of the forcing function, and it
 * only shrinks.
 *
 * This is a JSX-STRUCTURE rule, modelled on ui-kit's
 * `no-groupless-dropdown-menu-label`: a `JSXOpeningElement` visitor that walks
 * the parent chain up to the enclosing COMPONENT. A separator rendered in a
 * different component from any menu is the ambiguous case worth a look.
 *
 * "Component" is the load-bearing word, and it is narrower than "function". The
 * walk stops at a function DECLARATION or an arrow/function expression bound to
 * a capitalized name — the shapes that define a component — and walks straight
 * through an inline callback. A separator inside `groups.map((g) => …)` is in
 * the same JSX tree as the `DropdownMenuContent` around the map, not in a
 * different component, and stopping there would report every grouped menu in
 * the repo.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT carry the shared `class-token-walk` block the
 * `no-adhoc-*` class rules share (and `class-token-walk-in-sync` keeps
 * byte-identical). Signal C needs one element's own class expression, not a
 * whole-file alias resolution, so it reads a deliberately simpler set of tokens:
 * string literals and template chunks inside the element's `className`. A class
 * string routed through a `const` or a lookup map is out of scope here on
 * purpose — the burndown list is what catches those.
 *
 * Escape hatch per-site, travelling with the code:
 *
 *   // eslint-disable-next-line control-panel/no-adhoc-panel-body -- <reason>

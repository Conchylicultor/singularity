// ── The control-panel geometry gate ─────────────────────────────────
//
// One region fixture plus one layout fixture per property the vocabulary exists
// to hold. They render the REAL components with real Tailwind in a real browser
// and measure boxes, so "every label starts at one x" stops being a review note
// and becomes a number the build compares.
//
// Every width everywhere: 262 / 320 / 524px — the `menu`, `picker` and `builder`
// width roles from `popover-width.ts`. A panel is only ever one of those three
// widths, so sweeping them is sweeping the whole real range rather than an
// invented one.
//
// ### How a fixture reaches inside the primitive
//
// The `data-geo` contract is an attribute the FIXTURE authors, and the panel
// primitives build their own cells — a row's icon cell, its label cell and the
// rule row's six tracks are internal spans with no prop to hang an attribute on.
// So each measured cell is marked from the inside, by a probe passed through the
// slot that lands in it:
//
//   - `<Fills>` — a `block w-full` box inside a cell. Because it fills the cell,
//     its left/right edges ARE the cell's, which is what makes "the label starts
//     at the text rail" measurable. Measuring the glyph or the text itself would
//     report a couple of centering pixels instead of the track.
//   - `<RailMarker>` — a zero-width box placed as LOOSE panel content, so it
//     sits wherever the panel's own inset puts it. It carries NO class: the
//     panel's content inset IS the rail, which is the property half these
//     fixtures exist to gate. Its edges therefore sit exactly on the rail, so
//     `leftPack(after: rail, gap: 0)` reads "this cell begins where the rail
//     says it does" — comparing two INDEPENDENT mechanisms: the `calc()` tokens
//     the panel's padding is built from versus the grid tracks the row is built
//     from. That is the whole of invariant #1, and it is the pair that can
//     actually drift.
//     There is only ONE marker kind now. v1 had two, because the panel's inset
//     was the TEXT rail and a section label hung back to the icon rail through a
//     `cp-rail-icon` class; the inset IS the icon rail today, that offset is
//     zero, and the class is gone.

  // The region fixture, and the reason the two fixtures below it are no longer

  // ~50px left of every label around it, and it closed exactly that case — an
  // `<Input>` and a `<Button>`, both named here, both authored here. The next
  // child kind nobody thought of was just as unmeasured as the first.
  //
  // A `RegionFixture` hands the harness a HOLE instead: it says only "this box
  // opens a region", and `REGION_CHILDREN` decides what goes in it — a bare
  // input, a bare button, bare prose, a `display: contents`-wrapped
  // contribution, a `rail-follow` band, a `rail-bleed` row. Adding a member
  // there re-gates this panel with no edit here, which is what turns
  // "any new fixture must render something other than a Row" from a sentence
  // asking authors to remember into something they cannot get wrong.
  //
  // The children go inside a `Section` because that is how content actually
  // reaches a panel, and because the band is claimed to be inset-transparent:
  // `cp-panel` is the one box that pays, `cp-band` adds nothing, so a child
  // lands on the rail through it by doing nothing at all. Both halves of that
  // claim are under test here.

  // asymmetric `calc()` pair (chrome pad + icon rail on the start, chrome pad +
  // row pad on the end) rather than a step off the ramp — so this is also the
  // fixture that proves a hand-built rail publishes what it actually applies.

  // The gap the other four fixtures could not see. They render Rows and

  // every one of them passed while a raw `<Input>` dropped into a Section sat
  // flush against the panel's edge, ~50px left of the labels above and below
  // it. A panel is not a list of rows: `view-settings-popover` puts an Input and
  // a contributed `FieldRenderer` straight into a Section, and a `Setting`
  // contribution may put anything there.
  //
  // So the fixture measures LOOSE content — an `<Input>`, and a `<Button>` in a
  // second section — against the rail the ROW GRID computes, with no wrapper and
  // no opt-in anywhere in the fixture. That is the whole contract: the panel is
  // the one box that applies the content inset, so content that does nothing
  // lands on the rail, and only a Row (which cancels the inset to bleed its
  // hover fill full-width) has to do anything at all.
  //
  // The rail is the ICON rail. v1 measured loose content against a row's LABEL,
  // and that was the defect this fixture could not see: an interior column of the
  // row grid was handed to every search field and swatch grid in the app, which
  // indented them 26px past the section label above them. The comparison is now
  // loose content versus the row's leading CELL — and the panel here has no drag
  // handle in it, so that cell is also the first track the grid draws.

  // unit test, because the oracle has no height invariant to express it with.

  //
  // Measured as three facts that together say exactly that, at both widths:
  //
  //   - `rigidIntegrity` on the trailing box — it gave up nothing.
  //   - `noClip` — and nothing was pushed out of the panel either.
  //   - ⇒ the narrowing was absorbed by the label, and `noOverlap` says it was
  //     absorbed by truncating rather than by sliding under the trailing cell.
  //
  // NOT `truncationOnsetOrder(content, indicator)`, which is what this fixture
  // first tried: that invariant requires BOTH slots to enter the truncating state
  // somewhere in the sweep, and a `cp-row`'s trailing cell structurally never
  // does. Its track is `auto`, whose base size is the item's min-content
  // contribution — for a nowrap text that is the whole string, and `min-w-0` on a
  // descendant cannot lower it, because the grid item is the primitive's own
  // wrapper. The trailing cell being unshrinkable IS the invariant here, so the
  // assertion was unsatisfiable by construction, not merely mis-tuned.
  //
  // The falsification is the load-bearing half. It re-renders the same row as the
  // construct ui-kit's CLAUDE.md documents as the bug — the trailing control
  // pulled out of flow (`absolute right-2`) with its space merely HINTED by
  // right-padding on a flex row — and asserts `noOverlap` then fails. Reserved
  // padding is a hint the flexible label can ignore, and it does: the label slides
  // straight under the control. If that mutation ever stops failing, this whole
  // fixture is measuring nothing, and the suite says so out loud rather than going
  // quietly green.

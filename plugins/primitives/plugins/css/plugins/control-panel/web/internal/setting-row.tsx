 * drift.
 *
 * The host is ALWAYS a plain `<div>`. That is not a default, it is the
 * construction: `ControlPanelSettingProps` carries no `onSelect` and no `href`,
 * so the row can never become a click target, and a control nested inside its
 * cells is therefore legal here and only here. Same trade `RuleRow` made — the
 * two row families differ on exactly one honest axis, who is the click target,
 * enforced by disjoint prop sets rather than by review.
 *
 * The trailing cluster composes `RowActions` at `pin={null}`, verbatim the
 * `RuleRow` construction: the track already reserves the space, so the cluster
 * belongs IN FLOW; pinning it would float it over the value cell. It borrows
 * that primitive's reveal coupling — a hidden action is never a live hit-target
 * — and its xs density instead of restating either.

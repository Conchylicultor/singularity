 * so every label in every panel starts at the same x whether or not this
 * particular row has an icon, and a long label truncates in its own column
 * instead of sliding under the trailing control.
 *
 * The two leading tracks are reserved only when the PANEL has something to put
 * in them, which is why each row marks its own occupants: `data-cp-handle` when
 * it hangs a drag handle, `data-cp-icon` when its leading cell is actually
 * occupied — an icon, a checkbox or a radio mark, never a switch (which is
 * drawn in the trailing cell). A panel with neither is a two-track grid, and
 * its rows sit flush against the panel's own content inset — no reserved
 * columns nothing paints in.
 * The scan is per PANEL, never per row: derive it per row and a row with an icon
 * would indent its label past a row without one, which is the conditional
 * leading cell invariant #1 exists to delete.
 *
 * It is its own grid rather than a composed `css/row`'s `Row` on purpose. `Row`
 * is a `<Line>`-based FLEX row whose `icon` is a leading flex child, so the
 * label's x depends on whether an icon is present — that IS the 12/14/20/38px
 * misalignment this vocabulary exists to remove, and flex has no track that
 * occupies width when empty. Adding a grid mode plus a panel-only geometry axis
 * to a primitive with 50+ call sites costs more than eight lines of duplicated
 * element inference. The two stay in step by sharing TOKENS (`--pad-row-x`,
 * `--control-height-md`, the surface-following hover fill), not code.
 *
 * The host element is INFERRED, never authored — `href` → `<a>`,
 * `onSelect`/`disabled` → `<button>`, else a plain `<div>`. Same rule as `Row`,
 * so an author learns it once.
 *
 * ## Two constructions, chosen by `actions`
 *
 * **Without `actions`** the inferred element IS the row box: one node carrying
 * `cp-row`, with the four cells as its direct children. That is the shape ~50
 * call sites render today, and it is the reason the trailing cell is
 * presentational — a `<button>` inside a `<button>` is invalid DOM.
 *
 * **With `actions`** the row splits, the same way `css/row`'s `Row` splits when
 * it is handed both a click target and an action cluster. The box is always a
 * non-interactive `<div>`, and the selectable part becomes an inner element
 * spanning every track but the last — so the action buttons are that element's
 * SIBLINGS rather than its descendants, which is the only construction in which
 * both are legal at once. The inner element is a CSS **subgrid**: the panel's
 * tracks pass straight through it, so the gutter, icon and label cells land on
 * exactly the rails they land on in the other construction and invariant #1
 * never learns that this row is built differently. `col-[1/-2]` is written
 * track-count agnostic because `cp-row` has 2/3/4-track templates depending on
 * what the PANEL occupies, and a hardcoded span would break in three of them.

/**
 * The selectable region of a row that carries `actions` — the element the row's
 * props inferred, rendered INSIDE the row box instead of as it.
 *
 * It is a subgrid, and that is the whole trick: `grid-cols-subgrid` makes the
 * panel's own tracks pass through this element unchanged, so the three cells it
 * holds land on exactly the rails they would as direct children of `cp-row`.
 * There is deliberately NO `gap` here — a subgrid inherits the parent grid's
 * column gap, and restating it is how the leading cells drift off the panel rail.
 *
 * `self-stretch` against the row's `align-items: center`, so the click target
 * fills the row's full `--cp-row-h` height rather than only its content's: an
 * inferred-height target would leave a few dead pixels above and below the label
 * that the un-split construction has never had.
 *
 * Three concrete elements again rather than one `<Tag>` local, for the reason
 * spelled out at the call site.

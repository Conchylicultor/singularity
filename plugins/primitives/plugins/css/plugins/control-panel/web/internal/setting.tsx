/**
 * THE VALUE ROW — "Label ………… [ control ]", the shape the vocabulary had no way
 * to say, and the shape config is full of.
 *
 * It is a new member, not a fourth `select` arm and not a promoted `Field`:
 *
 *  - Not a `select` arm. `select` is the SELECTION-LANGUAGE axis and invariant
 *    #3 says there are three of those. A dropdown is not a fourth way to say
 *    "on", it is a control inside a cell — and `Row`'s host is inferred from
 *    `onSelect`/`href`, so a `Row` holding a dropdown would be a `<button>`
 *    inside a `<button>`. A `select="value"` arm would type that as correct.
 *  - Not a promoted `Field`. `ControlPanel.Field` is THE BOX A VALUE IS PICKED
 *    FROM — an outline `Button`, `w-full justify-between`, truncating. It is
 *    correct as a cell-level control and the filter builder needs it to stay
 *    one.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `icon`. The leading-track `:has()` scan is per PANEL,
 * so one field carrying a type icon would indent EVERY label in that panel by an
 * icon column — and a config field is contributed into panels its host does not
 * own, so the trigger for that would live in another plugin's descriptor. It is
 * the quick-theme footer-glyph failure with a longer fuse, and it is excluded at
 * the type level exactly as `icon` is already excluded from the check/radio arm.

/**
 * The sanctioned way to open a control panel.
 *
 * What it does NOT have is the point: no `width`, no `padding`, no
 * `contentClassName`. (`maxHeight` IS here — a cap on height is not a width
 * measurement, and the panel already fits the viewport unconditionally; see the
 * prop.) Those are exactly the props that let three panels in one
 * toolbar end up 481, 384 and 256 pixels wide — each set by whatever was widest
 * inside it. `size` maps to a width ROLE, the padding is the panel body's, and
 * there is nowhere to smuggle a measurement through. That is what makes "width
 * is a role" enforceable rather than aspirational: the escape is absent from the
 * type, not defaulted in it.
 *
 * There is no `tooltip` prop either — the caller's trigger (typically an
 * `IconButton`) already owns its tooltip, and a second one here would be a
 * second source for the same string.
 *
 * The children are wrapped in a `ControlPanel.Stack`, so `usePanelStack()` works
 * inside ANY panel opened this way. A sub-panel is then a push, never a popover
 * opened from inside a popover.
 *
 * …which is also the host policy it publishes: a `Group` here PUSHES, and a
 * description here is a `hint`. A popover passes field subsets precisely because
 * it wants short labels rather than prose, so a paragraph in one is already the
 * wrong surface for the paragraph.

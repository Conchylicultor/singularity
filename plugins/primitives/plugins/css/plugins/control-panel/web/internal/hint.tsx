/**
 * A row's LABEL cell, with `hint` wired into it.
 *
 * `hint` is prose as a TOOLTIP, never a second line. A second line is the one
 * change that breaks invariant #2 in every panel at once, and a muted pseudo-row
 * breaks invariant #1's meaning — a row that is not a control still opening the
 * rails. So the hint costs no height and reserves no track: it adds a leading
 * glyph to nothing, a trailing cell to nothing, and a column to nothing.
 *
 * It lands in the LABEL cell rather than around the row for that last reason. A
 * `WithTooltip` around the row's HOST would have to merge props and a ref into
 * whichever of the three elements the row inferred, and the label cell is
 * already the widest box in the row — `minmax(0, 1fr)` — so it is what the
 * pointer is over anyway.
 *
 * Two readings of one string, which is deliberate: sighted users get the
 * tooltip, and assistive tech gets an `aria-describedby` pointing at a zero-box
 * `sr-only` sibling inside the cell. `sr-only` is `position: absolute`, so the
 * description generates no box in the grid and cannot widen the label track or
 * push the row onto a second line. A tooltip alone would be invisible on touch
 * and unreachable by a screen reader; a description alone would be invisible to
 * everyone else.
 *
 * That sibling is `aria-hidden`, and it has to be: it lives INSIDE the row, so
 * without it the row's accessible NAME would be its label followed by its whole
 * hint — the same defect the icon cell is hidden for one file over. A node that
 * is *directly referenced* by `aria-describedby` still contributes its text to
 * the description even when hidden (accname §2A), so the description survives
 * and only the name is spared.

 * prose that WRAPS. A flow container, so it resets the row's single-line
 * contract for the description only; the label keeps its own `truncate`.
 *
 * The description is the row's accessible description by `aria-describedby`
 * (the host points at `descriptionId`) and is `aria-hidden` inside the cell, so
 * the row's NAME stays its label alone — the same split `hint` makes.
 *
 * The label is a TITLE over its prose — medium weight in the strong text tier —
 * so the choice reads first and its meaning second.
 *
 * The cell pads itself vertically so two lines sit inside the row's box with
 * the breathing room a one-line row gets from `--cp-row-h`; the row's
 * `min-height` then grows to fit rather than clipping.

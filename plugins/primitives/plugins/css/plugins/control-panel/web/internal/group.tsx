 * A FIELD THAT IS OTHER FIELDS — an object, a list, a variant. The fourth way to
 * be one field, after `Row` (the row IS the control), `Setting` (the row HOLDS
 * the control) and `Block` (the control is wider than a row).
 *
 * How it presents is the HOST's answer, read from `useControlPanelHost()`:
 *
 *  - `nesting: "push"` — a drill row that pushes a panel-stack entry. Right for
 *    a popover, where `usePanelStack().push` replaces the whole body: one box,
 *    one width and one set of rails at every depth, instead of a popover opened
 *    from inside a popover.
 *  - `nesting: "inline"` — an indented labelled band, down to the host's
 *    `inlineDepth`. Right for a pane, where replacing the whole body to edit one
 *    sub-object of fifteen loses the reader their place. Below the budget it
 *    pushes anyway, so a list-of-objects-of-lists still has somewhere to go.
 *
 * The indent is a NESTED RAIL REGION (`cp-group`), never a margin and never a
 * `border-l` + `pl-lg`: the group re-declares the rail one step deeper and pays
 * it, so a nested row's bleed reaches the group's edge and everything inside
 * behaves exactly as it does at panel level, one step in.

 * exactly how one shared grid degrades into six bespoke ones: the first call site
 * that needs "just one extra thing" writes its own row, and the alignment
 * invariant quietly becomes a convention again. `actions` covers the real case
 * (the filter's "Turn into group") inside the grid rather than beside it.
 *
 * `handleProps` plus `ref`/`style`/`className` forwarding are likewise not
 * niceties: both the sort rule list and the Properties list are dnd-kit
 * sortables, which need the transform style on the row box and the activator on
 * the handle.
 *
 * The row is a non-interactive `<div>`, which is what lets it legally nest the
 * remove button and the pickers its cells hold.

          `pin={null}` for both: the track already reserves this space, so the
          cluster belongs IN FLOW; pinning it would float it over the value cell
          and paint a `--scrim` this row has no tint to publish.

          They differ on the one axis that is genuinely per-cluster. `actions` is
          contextual and secondary (the filter's "Turn into group"), so it fades
          in on row hover. The remove ✕ is the builder's own verb — you add and
          drop rules constantly — and the track holds its width either way, so
          hiding it would cost discoverability and buy nothing: it lives at rest.
          The clusters render in that order, so `actions` sits before the ✕.

          `RowActions` also supplies the xs control density and the click /
          pointerdown guards, which is why this cell no longer sets its own. */}

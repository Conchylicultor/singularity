/**
 * The vocabulary, as ONE compound namespace.
 *
 * Read as a set, the four ways to be ONE FIELD sit next to each other: `Row`
 * (the row IS the control), `Setting` (the row HOLDS the control), `Block` (the
 * control is wider than a row) and `Group` (the field is other fields) — plus
 * the builder pair, plus the boxes and bands.
 *
 * That shape is the API's main affordance: typing `ControlPanel.` shows the
 * author the whole closed set at the point of writing, and says there is no
 * further thing. It is also why `control-panel` is one plugin rather than an
 * umbrella of small ones — attaching members exported by sibling plugins onto a
 * single object is a cross-plugin re-export in all but syntax, which the
 * boundary checker rejects transitively. (`switch` is genuinely reusable outside
 * panels and has no namespace tie, so it IS its own plugin.)

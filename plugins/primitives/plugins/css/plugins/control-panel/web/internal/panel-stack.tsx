 * groups, and custom-columns' per-field editor.
 *
 * Pushing beats opening a popover from inside a popover, which is what these
 * surfaces do today: a nested group grows the panel horizontally past the pane,
 * and a second floating layer has its own width, its own clamp and its own
 * dismissal. A pushed panel is the same box, the same width and the same rails

          are laid out by the enclosing `ControlPanel`'s own `cp-body` flex
          container, which is then the ONE box spacing bands and the ONE box
          cancelling the first band's rule.
          It used to carry `cp-body` itself, to re-create a `& > * + *` sibling
          rule the panel could not reach through it. That was a workaround for
          exactly one level of wrapping, and it silently stopped working at two
          (the framework's own `renderIsolated` lineage span is the next one down)
          — which is why the rule now belongs to the bands. Events and refs are
          unaffected by `display: contents`: the element is still in the DOM and

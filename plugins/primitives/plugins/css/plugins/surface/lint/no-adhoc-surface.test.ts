/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-surface` lint rule. Run with `bun test` from the repo
 * root (or this file's directory).
 *
 * The rule fingerprints two open-coded surface recipes — `raised` (rounded +
 * border + bg-card + padding — the former no-adhoc-card) and `overlay`
 * (bg-popover + shadow + rounded) — and flags the literal recipe on ANY host
 * element (intrinsic, layout component, or member-expression tag). It does NOT
 * lint `base` (bg-background) or `sunken` (bg-muted), which are ambiguous. The
 * sanctioned surfaces flow through, structurally: the `SURFACE_LEVELS` member
 * access is opaque to the literal-only token walk, and the shadcn primitive
 * definition files are exempted by a file-glob in lint/index.ts. Per-site escapes
 * are the `p-card` padding token and `// eslint-disable-next-line`.

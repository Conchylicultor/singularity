/**
 * Ad-hoc surface markup reinvents the elevation bundle the `<Surface>` primitive
 * (and its `<Card>` / overlay wrappers) exists to freeze. Each open-coded
 * `bg-card`/`bg-popover` + border/ring + shadow + radius recipe drifts a little —
 * which is exactly why a theme/preset swap can only repaint colors, never fix the
 * flat, inconsistent depth. This rule fingerprints the two *disambiguable*
 * recipes and redirects them to a semantic level.
 *
 * The gate is the *recipe*, not the host tag. The literal recipe is illegal on
 * ANY host element — an intrinsic (`<div>`/`<section>`/`<nav>`/…), a capitalized
 * layout component (`<Stack>`/`<SortableItem>`/…), or a member-expression tag
 * (`<Foo.Bar>`). A surface recipe smuggled through a layout component's
 * `className` is exactly the drift this rule exists to stop, so there is no
 * tag-allowlist to fail open through (the former `HOST_TAGS` gate did just that).
 *
 * Two fingerprints, each a co-occurrence of classes that may live in different
 * `cn()` fragments — so we aggregate every class token of one class-name
 * attribute (`className`, or a `*ClassName` pass-through prop) into a single Set
 * and test against it:
 *
 *   - `raised`  — `rounded` + `border` + the card-surface token `bg-card` +
 *                 padding → `<Surface level="raised">` / `<Card>`. (This is the
 *                 former `no-adhoc-card` fingerprint, folded in here.)
 *   - `overlay` — `bg-popover` + a `shadow-*` + `rounded` →
 *                 `<Surface level="overlay">` / `PopoverContent`.
 *
 * Two legitimate homes for the recipe, both invisible to this gate:
 *
 *   1. The `SURFACE_LEVELS` member-access indirection — `cn(SURFACE_LEVELS.raised,
 *      …)` reads the bundle off a member expression, never a string literal. This
 *      is load-bearing: `collectTokens` harvests ONLY string-`Literal` /
 *      `TemplateElement` values, so a map-driven class is opaque and the canonical
 *      sanctioned surface flows straight through. The literal-only walk IS the
 *      escape valve.
 *   2. The surface-primitive *definition* files under `ui-kit/web/components/ui/`
 *      — the shadcn primitives that open-code the recipe as literal strings on
 *      base-ui `*.Popup` member tags (they ARE the implementation behind
 *      `<Surface level="overlay">` / `PopoverContent`). They own the raw recipe and
 *      are exempted by a file-glob in `lint/index.ts`, exactly as `no-adhoc-layout`
 *      exempts the layout primitives that own raw mechanics.
 *
 * We DON'T fingerprint `base` (`bg-background`) or `sunken` (`bg-muted`): those
 * tokens legitimately appear on dividers, hover states, chips, drop-zones and
 * bands without being a contained surface, so there's no false-positive-free
 * signal. They're offered as `<Surface>` levels but not hard-linted — same
 * reasoning the card rule gave for keying on `bg-card`, not the broader tokens.
 *
 * No auto-fix: mapping bespoke chrome to a `<Surface>` level + import is a
 * per-site judgement (same stance as `no-adhoc-control` / `no-adhoc-zindex`).

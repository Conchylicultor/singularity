 * consistently instead of each call site freezing its own ad-hoc recipe.
 *
 * Like `<Card>` (which is now a thin `<Surface level="raised">` wrapper), the
 * Ctrl+A **select-scope** is baked into the ROOT element: the surface becomes the
 * scope, so a click into it + Ctrl+A selects only its subtree. The scope handler
 * is GUARANTEED to run even when the consumer passes its own `onKeyDown` — we
 * compose consumer-first, then the scope handler, and apply the merged handler
 * AFTER `{...rest}` so nothing can clobber it. (Consumer-first is safe: an
 * activation handler preventDefaults on Enter/Space, while the scope handler only
 * acts on Ctrl/Cmd+"a", so they never interfere.)

      //   - `as="a"` is `display: inline` by default, and an inline box holding
      //     block-level children is split into fragments — the browser paints the
      //     bg/border/radius on the empty leading + trailing fragments, i.e. two
      //     stray slivers and no card chrome. `block` closes that.
      //   - `as="button"` centres its content, vertically AND horizontally, by
      //     UA rule (buttons are controls, and a control's label sits in its
      //     middle). A card that is a column of prose then sinks to the middle of

      //     the two fork cards of the website shipped with their eyebrows on two
      //     different baselines for exactly this reason. A flex column with the
      //     default `flex-start` main-axis packing is the box a card actually is,
      //     and `text-left` returns the text to a paragraph's alignment.

  //   row's 4 icon buttons) permanently steals ~100px from the row body via
  //   `shrink-0`, collapsing the flex-1 title cell and truncating the title even

  //   which is why the pin's `mask` (owned by the primitive) is not optional: it
  //   paints the row's own `--scrim` under the buttons with a gradient ramp on
  //   its inner edge, so what the cluster covers (a trailing status badge, a long
  //   title) dissolves under it rather than interleaving its glyphs with the
  //   icons. Reserving the width instead would cure the overlap too, at the cost
  //   the paragraph above rejects.
  // - `actionsAlwaysVisible` actions instead stay in flow (`pin={null}`): they
  //   are part of the row layout and legitimately reserve their space, so the
  //   placement `Row` hands down is `ml-auto shrink-0` — flush right, never

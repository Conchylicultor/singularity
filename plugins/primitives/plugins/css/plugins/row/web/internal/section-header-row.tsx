/**
 * What the header's text IS, which is what picks its treatment.
 *
 * - **`eyebrow`** (default) — a label the APP wrote: "Tokens", "Parameters",
 *   "Preview". Small caps, because caps mark it as chrome naming the run of
 *   rows below it rather than as content.
 * - **`title`** — the section's own name, at body weight. What `SectionCard`
 *   uses.
 * - **`value`** — a value out of the DATA, not a label at all: a DataView's
 *   group-by header, which is whatever the grouped column happens to hold
 *   ("Mine", "In progress", `agent-manager`). It gets the eyebrow's size and
 *   tone and NOT its caps, because uppercasing a value misspells it — a
 *   composition name is a namespace component stored lowercase, and a header
 *   reading `AGENT-MANAGER` shows an identifier in a form nothing stores.
 *
 * The split exists because a group header used to take the `eyebrow` default by
 * omission, which is how the app came to shout its own data back at the reader.

 * - **`trailing`** — right after the label run, and only while the row is
 *   hovered or its control has keyboard focus — the chevron is decoration,
 *   the row itself is the control. For a QUIET
 *   header whose label should start flush on the rows' own column: a group
 *   header that reads "Queue 6", with the fold affordance appearing where the
 *   pointer already is. `aria-expanded` and the click target are unchanged —
 *   only where the ink sits, and when, differs.
 *
 * The reveal is the `hover-reveal` primitive's per-instance state
 * (`useHoverReveal`), not a Tailwind group: `Row` already publishes
 * `group/row-actions` for its action cluster, and a chevron keyed off that
 * group would borrow a name another primitive owns. Headers are few (one per
 * section), so the per-row state costs nothing measurable.

/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-row` lint rule. Run with `./singularity test
 * plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/row`.
 *
 * The first invalid case under "fingerprint B" is the acceptance test the second
 * fingerprint exists for: `PanelActionRow` as it stood before
 * `research/2026-08-17-global-row-usable-below-icon-button.md` — `Row`'s chrome
 * hand-copied onto `<Line as="button">` to route around an import cycle. It
 * escaped fingerprint A twice over (a capitalized host tag, and `p-row` counting
 * as a sanctioned padding escape), which is exactly why B keys on `p-row` as a
 * SIGNAL rather than an escape.
 *
 * The primitive itself trips B by construction — no class-level test can tell
 * `Row` from an exact copy of `Row` — so it is exempted by path in `lint/index.ts`,
 * not in the rule. Nothing here asserts that; the glob is the contract.

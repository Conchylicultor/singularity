/**
 * A focus or ring class authored on a `<Row>`/`<SectionHeaderRow>` styles a node
 * that stops being the focused one the day the row grows an action.
 *
 * `Row` renders as ONE element until it is given `actions`, at which point it
 * splits into a plain container box plus an inner `<button>`/`<a>` sibling of the
 * action cluster (nesting interactive elements is invalid DOM). `className` keeps
 * landing on the BOX. So a focus treatment authored here styles the box — which
 * stops being the focused node the day the row gains an action, while the browser
 * goes on drawing its own outline on the inner control. That is two nested
 * indicators for one focus, and it appeared without anyone editing the call site.
 *
 * `Row` therefore owns the focus treatment outright: it paints the app's canonical
 * ring (`focus-ring` + `focus-ring-from`) on the row box on BOTH paths and
 * suppresses the control's own outline. A focus or ring class on a `Row` is now
 * always either dead or a double-draw.
 *
 * The predicate reads the *token*, not the raw string: Tailwind's `!` important
 * marker is stripped and the variant chain is split bracket-aware, so
 * `dark:focus-visible:ring-2`, `hover:focus:outline-2` and
 * `has-[:focus-visible]:ring-3` are all seen for what they are. A token trips the
 * rule when its utility base is an `outline-*` / `ring-*` / `focus-ring-*`
 * treatment, OR when any variant in its chain is `focus`/`focus-visible`/
 * `focus-within`, OR when an arbitrary variant's selector text mentions `focus`.
 *
 * Like `no-adhoc-row` this walks the whole `className` attribute — tokens spread
 * across `cn()` fragments and conditional expressions aggregate into one Set — and
 * ships no auto-fix: deleting the styling versus reaching for `selected` is a
 * per-site judgement.
 *
 * `row/web/**` is path-exempt (`lint/index.ts`): the primitive is where the real
 * treatment is applied, and no class-level test can tell the definition site from
 * a copy of it. Same precedent as `no-adhoc-row`'s glob.

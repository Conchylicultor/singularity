/**
 * Tests for the `no-row-focus-class` lint rule. Run with `./singularity test
 * plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/row`.
 *
 * The second invalid case is the acceptance test the rule exists for: the
 * `sub-page-block` row as it stood — `outline-none` plus an `isFocused &&
 * "ring-primary/30 ring-1"` caret cue, authored on the row box that `Row` stops
 * focusing the day the row gains an action.
 *
 * The primitive itself carries the real treatment (`focus-ring` +
 * `focus-ring-from`) and so trips the rule by construction — it is exempted by
 * path in `lint/index.ts`, not in the rule. Nothing here asserts that; the glob
 * is the contract.

/**
 * Native radio guardrail.
 *
 * A `<input type="radio">` is grouped by its `name` attribute, and nothing else.
 * Two groups that share a `name` ARE one group to the browser: selecting an
 * option in the first clears the second's native checked state, and arrow-key
 * roving focus walks across both. Every hand-rolled group therefore has to mint
 * a `name` that is unique per *instance* — not per component, not per field type
 * — and the two field renderers that tried both wrote a module-level literal
 * (`"enum-field"`, `"dynamic-enum-field"`), silently merging every instance on
 * the page into one group.
 *
 * What made it survive review is that a controlled `checked` prop repaints the
 * correct dots regardless, so the damage is invisible on screen and shows up
 * only in keyboard navigation and assistive-tech grouping.
 *
 * The fix is to remove the choice: `RadioGroup`
 * (`@plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/radio-group/web`) derives `name`
 * from `useId()` and does not accept one, so a collision is unrepresentable.
 * This rule keeps the mechanic there by flagging raw `<input type="radio">`
 * everywhere else.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow — only an intrinsic `<input>` whose `type` is the
 * literal string `"radio"` (bare or in an expression container). A computed
 * `type={someVar}` is not flagged: it is vanishingly rare and would need type
 * info to resolve, and this rule is intentionally syntax-only so it runs
 * everywhere cheaply. Button-based groups carrying `role="radiogroup"` (e.g.
 * `SegmentedControl`) are untouched — they have no native `name` and no
 * collision.
 *
 * No auto-fix: swapping in the primitive changes the surrounding markup
 * (label wrapper, option list shape), which is not safe to mechanize.

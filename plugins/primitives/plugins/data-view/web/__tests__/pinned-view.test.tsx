/**
 * The pinned-instance contract, at the seam where it was nearly lost.
 *
 * `resolveActiveId` answers a pinned id that is not authored with `""` (proved
 * in its own suite, beside it). This asserts the other half: that the SHELL
 * renders that as "not authored" rather than falling through to `instances[0]`.
 * The fallback is correct for an unpinned surface and catastrophic for a pinned
 * one — a mis-pinned backup panel silently rendering the Active tab is a
 * different list that looks like a working one — and it is invisible on any
 * surface that has instances at all, which is every real surface.

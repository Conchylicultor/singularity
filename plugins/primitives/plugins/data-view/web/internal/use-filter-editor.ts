 * stack renders either the root or the top entry, never both — so a provider
 * mounted by the root panel does not wrap the sub-panel pushed out of it, and a
 * context read there would throw. Handing the editor down through the push
 * closure instead would be worse than a crash: the closure is captured when the
 * row is clicked, so the second edit made inside a nested group would be computed
 * against the tree as it was before the first, silently dropping it.
 *
 * Every consumer therefore calls this hook itself and gets the tree as it is now.

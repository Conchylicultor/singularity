/**
 * What the closed Sort control says — in its trigger's tooltip + accessible name,
 * and as the compact fold's row text: the top sort level, plus how many further
 * levels there are.
 *
 * Dangling rules — a `fieldId` the active schema no longer carries, after a
 * removed custom column or a switch between merged sources — are dropped with
 * exactly the predicate `SortController.ruleCount` uses, so the summary and the
 * count agree by construction. A rule that sorts nothing must not be described:
 * "Title ↑ +1" where the +1 is a field that no longer exists is a lie about what
 * the user is looking at.
 *
 * The label leans on an arrow because the fold's row gives it one line; `spoken`
 * is what a screen reader gets instead, since "↑" reads as nothing useful.
 *
 * Pure: it takes state, never hooks (see `DataViewControlContribution.summary`).

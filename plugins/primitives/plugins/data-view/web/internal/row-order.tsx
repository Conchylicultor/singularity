/**
 * Host fold for the global `DataViewSlots.RowOrder` slot — the row-order twin of
 * `CollectFieldExtensions`. Reads the slot's contributions and **recursively**
 * mounts each one, threading the accumulated order through nested
 * render-callbacks: every contributor mounts (running its own hooks), hands back
 * a `ManualOrderConfig` (or `null` to abstain) via `render`, and that recurses to
 * the next contributor — finally calling `children(acc)`.
 *
 * Unlike the field fold it does not accumulate a list: it folds a single
 * `ManualOrderConfig | null`, and **the first non-null wins** (`acc ?? order`).
 * The slot is a `defineRenderSlot`, so that precedence is a committed reorder
 * override rather than an import-order accident.
 *
 * Written as a recursive COMPONENT, never a `.map` over contributed hooks:
 * mounting each contributor as its own React element keeps the per-component hook
 * order stable (the contribution set is fixed at build time → recursion depth is
 * stable → `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` is satisfied).
 *
 * `enabled: false` short-circuits **before** `useContributions()` AND before the
 * ordered set is derived — so a DataView that cannot use a row order (a
 * tree/gallery view, a `dataSource` surface, an aggregated or grouped view, or one
 * whose consumer already owns a domain order) never mounts a contributor, never
 * subscribes to its live resource, and never pays for a filter pass it discards.
 * That is why the fold takes the RAW rows plus the pipeline's ingredients rather
 * than a pre-computed ordered set: deriving it in the host would cost every
 * DataView an extra `useFlatRows` on every render.

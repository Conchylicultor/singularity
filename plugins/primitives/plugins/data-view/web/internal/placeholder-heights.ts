 * left with them, at its own height. Several placeholders appearing between
 * the same neighbours share that span, row for row when their counts match it,
 * else in proportion to their rows. A placeholder with nothing measured to
 * replace (a page released before it was drawn, a new read) is its rows at the
 * pitch; so is a row never measured inside a replaced span.

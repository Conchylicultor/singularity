 * and each crossing after; a MutationObserver only ENROLLS the rows a view

 * matched against: a measurement is only ever handed out for the epoch it
 * was taken in, and only once it can vouch for what is drawn:
 * - a new epoch is `measuring` until a settle that ran after its rows were
 *   committed — an older measurement says nothing about rows that were not
 *   there yet (a head that just landed is not "off screen");
 * - a settle waits while a row it enrolled has had no entry yet (its first
 *   one is on its way);
 * - with no row drawn at all there is nothing to measure — it stays
 *   `measuring` (a skeleton, a view that marks no row), never an empty set.
 *
 * Each settle also measures the ADVANCE of every drawn row whose next entry
 * in its read is drawn too (see {@link RowsOnScreen.advances}).

/**
 * What the body renders in place of the active view, if anything — the one
 * precedence both data paths share:
 *
 *   server error > failed read > failed field > loading > pending field > the view.
 *
 * A server-ordered origin's `error` is the query it could not form or page
 * (`server-error`); its `readError` is the read itself failing with nothing to
 * show — the same `error` arm the in-memory path's `readiness` fails with, so
 * a live list and a resource-backed one render a failure alike (Retry, and
 * the reload a stale tab needs). Without a `readiness` the in-memory rows are
 * taken as ready (a static list). A failed read never reaches the view, whose
 * empty rows would claim "nothing here" (`emptyState`).
 *
 * `readFields` are the fields the view PARTITIONS, ORDERS or MATCHES rows by
 * (`fieldsReadByView`). One whose own values are not known yet
 * (`FieldDef.pending`) makes the body loading, and one whose values failed
 * with nothing held (`FieldDef.readError`) makes it that failure: grouping by
 * a field with no values would put every row in its unset bucket (an enum's
 * "None"), sorting would order by nothing and a filter would match nothing —
 * each a claim about the rows that then reverses.

/**

 * read off the state: the stored `state.fold` is not the one applied while a
 * search is typed (suspended) or in a view that draws no fold lines (the
 * tree), and a field named only by a fold nothing applies must not hold the
 * body. Ids no field answers to are skipped (a dangling rule is the filter's
 * own concern). The search query is not a layout read: it runs over the
 * search accessor, which a contributed field opts out of (`filterable`).

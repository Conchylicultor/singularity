 * `useDataViewControls()`.
 *
 * With no rules yet it IS the search-first field list ("Filter by…" typeahead
 * over the schema fields): picking a field adds a rule in one click, and the
 * grouped path sits below the list. The tree materializes from a transient empty
 * root on that first edit, so opening with no filter commits nothing.
 *
 * Once populated it is the root group's page — the rule list plus its own
 * `Add filter` row — over a footer of Save-as-preset / Clear-filter ROWS. The
 * footer used to be two ghost buttons pushed to opposite corners, the left one
 * opening a popover inside the popover.

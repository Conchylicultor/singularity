/**
 * Notion-style search-first field picker: a "Filter by…" typeahead over the
 * schema's filterable fields, each rendered as an icon + label
 * `ControlPanel.Row` — the shared menu row, so the list highlights, sizes and
 * reads like every other menu. Selecting a field reports its id to `onPick` in a
 * single click. It must be drawn inside a control panel (every host is one: the
 * filter / sort panels, and `FieldPicker`'s `ControlPanelPopover`). The panel
 * scrolls the list; there is no inner scroller, which would clip the rows'
 * full-width highlight. The shared building block
 * behind every "choose a field" surface in the filter builder — the empty state,
 * the `Add filter` affordance, and changing an existing rule's field — so they
 * all gain typeahead from one place.
 *
 * A schema several plugins contributed to is listed band by band under its
 * sections (`Common`, then each contributor's), and the typeahead matches the
 * band's name as well as the field's — so on the merged run surface "deploy"
 * finds the deploy arm's eight columns whatever they are called.

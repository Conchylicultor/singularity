/**
 * One group's children, as a section: the rule list, then this group's own
 * `Add filter` row.
 *
 * It takes a group ID rather than the group, and looks it up in the LIVE tree,
 * because it is also what a nested group pushes onto the panel stack — and a
 * stack entry's `render` closure is captured when the row is clicked, so a node
 * passed in would be the one from the moment the group was opened, and every edit
 * made inside it would be computed against that. The recursion mirrors the data:
 * one component per group, at any depth.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the id no longer resolves — deleting a group from inside
 * it is a legal thing to do, and the stack pops back on its own.

 * its own indented editor, so each level of nesting ate horizontal room and a
 * deep group grew the popover past the edge of the pane. A pushed page is the
 * same box, the same width and the same rails at every depth.

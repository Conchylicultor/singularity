 * "… N more" fold line at the end of their section.
 *
 * The rule is an ordinary `FilterGroup`, so it is edited with the filter
 * builder itself, pushed as a page and pointed at `fold.keep` by
 * `FoldFilterScope`. The section's row says the rule in words (the same
 * `summarizeFilter` the filter control's tooltip uses), and a second row clears
 * it.
 *
 * Not the tree's fold-children header action — that collapses subtrees; this
 * sets rows aside behind a fold line.

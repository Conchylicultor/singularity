/**
 * The settings control's panel body — the unified view-settings panel. It hosts
 * two contributable scopes:
 *
 *  - **Current view** — per-instance settings (`scope: "view"`); properties and
 *    group-by are such contributions.
 *  - **DataView** — surface-wide settings (`scope: "global"`); custom-columns'
 *    "Fields" UI is one such contribution (it imports the slot directly — the
 *    dependency is inverted, so the host names no individual setting).
 *
 * The body is a flat run of contributions, view scope first, each in `order`,
 * rendered uniformly through `renderIsolated` (error-boundary-isolated). **Each
 * contribution renders its own `ControlPanel.Section`** — so the host wraps
 * nothing, adds no element between the panel and a section, and the hairline
 * between two settings is drawn by the panel container rather than placed by
 * anyone. A contribution that self-hides therefore leaves no orphan rule behind
 * it, and the two scopes read as separated because their contributions are
 * ordered, not because a scope header says so.
 *
 * It no longer owns its own gear or popover — those are the toolbar's, built
 * generically from this control's `icon` and `label` like every other control's.
 * With that goes the self-hide: `isApplicable` on a `Control` is a pure function
 * and cannot read another slot's contributions, so settings is always applicable
 * and an empty panel says so. In practice nothing changes — custom-columns'
 * "Fields" setting declares no `isApplicable`, so the gear was already always
 * visible on every surface.

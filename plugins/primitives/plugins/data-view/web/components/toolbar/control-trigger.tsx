/**
 * ONE trigger for every toolbar control — there is no branch on which control it
 * is drawing. The toolbar used to hand-roll a `*BuilderTrigger` per control, each
 * with its own popover width and its own idea of what "active" looks like; the
 * only thing they actually differed in was an icon and a word.
 *
 * **It is icon-only, in every surface and at every width.** A ghost `IconButton`
 * at rest; `secondary` once the control is narrowing what you see. Nothing else
 * changes — no summary text on the button, no `+N` badge, and above all no
 * width-dependent form. A control that reads one way in a wide pane and another
 * way in a sidebar is the inconsistency this whole registry exists to remove, and
 * the toolbar's one line is the scarcest space in the app — in the agent-manager
 * sidebar, two summary pills consumed the whole bar.
 *
 * **The summary is still what the closed state says — in words, not in pixels.**
 * `control.summary(ctx)` feeds the accessible name and the tooltip, so hovering an
 * active Filter tells you "Filter: Status is none of 2 +1" and a screen reader is
 * told the same thing without ever opening the panel. `spoken` is the arm for a
 * label leaning on a glyph ("Updated ↓" reads as nothing aloud), and `+N` is
 * spelled out there because a bare number beside a phrase is ambiguous with no
 * visual context. The compact fold spends the same summary as visible text, on
 * rows that have room for it.

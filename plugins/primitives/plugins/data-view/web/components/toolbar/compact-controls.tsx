/**
 * The narrow-toolbar fold. One `MdTune` trigger (ghost, or `secondary` + count
 * badge when anything is active) opens a panel whose first page is the search
 * field and one row per control — each showing what that control is currently
 * doing, and opening it as a PAGE.
 *
 * **There are no nested popovers.** The fold used to lay out `[label]
 * [icon-button]` rows made of the wide bar's own triggers, so opening the filter
 * from a narrow toolbar meant a popover inside a popover: a second floating
 * layer, its own width, its own clamp, its own dismissal — over a surface that
 * was narrow to begin with. A push is the same box at every depth.
 *
 * Wide and compact share one code path: both mount `DataViewControlPanel`, which
 * is prop-less and reads `useDataViewControls()`. The wide layout puts it in a
 * popover, this one puts it in a stack entry, and there is nothing left for them
 * to diverge on.
 *
 * **The trigger is hover-revealed**, off the group the TOOLBAR ROW publishes —
 * so a surface at rest shows only its data, and pointing at the bar brings the
 * trigger back. The anchor is the bar and not the DataView root because the
 * trigger belongs to the bar: keyed on the root, grazing any row on the way
 * somewhere else flickered a control in the far top corner, unconnected to
 * anything the user was doing. Note this is the ONE fold: it applies
 * wherever the compact form appears, so the surfaces that already folded by
 * measurement — the agent-manager conversations sidebar and every other narrow
 * DataView — get the revealed trigger too. One fold, one behaviour; a
 * declaration-only reveal would mean two visually different compact bars whose
 * difference nothing in the UI explains.

  //
  // - `searching` — there is a query in the search field. A query is an ad-hoc
  //   gesture: it is typed, it narrows the list, and once the bar is folded away
  //   it leaves no other trace on screen — so the list reads as the view's whole
  //   contents when it is not. That is why the query lives in per-tab
  //   `sessionStorage` in the first place — the DataView CLAUDE.md's "State
  //   split" section calls it a gesture "that outlives its intent if it survives
  //   a browser restart" — and this reveal rule is downstream of exactly that
  //   split. The trigger is what the user follows back to the query they forgot
  //   they typed.
  // - `open` — its own panel is up. The panel is portaled, so the pointer leaves
  //   the hover group the instant it moves into it; without this the trigger
  //   would fade out from under the panel it opened.
  //
  // Note what is NOT here: filter, sort and group-by — nor `activeCount`, which
  // counts them. Those are the *durable* half of the same split. They live on
  // the view instance's config row: authored, persisted, git-promotable, part of
  // what that named view IS. A view called "Failed builds" is not a list hiding
  // things from you, it is that list, and it has nothing to confess — pinning
  // its trigger open forever would be reporting its own definition back to it as
  // if it were an accident. (The first attempt at this rule did pin on
  // `activeCount`, and since surfaces author a default sort in config, the
  // trigger never hid at all.) The badge still counts them, which is a different
  // and correct statement: "N things configured" is worth reading once you have
  // pointed at the surface.

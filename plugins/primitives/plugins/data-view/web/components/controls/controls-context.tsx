/**
 * Everything a toolbar control or a settings contribution needs, in ONE context.
 *
 * There is one context and not two (a "controls" one for the toolbar and a
 * "settings" one for the gear) because the settings menu is itself a control: it
 * is a `DataViewSlots.Control` contribution whose panel body happens to host
 * `DataViewSlots.Setting` contributions. Splitting them would mean deciding, per
 * new field, which of two contexts it belongs in — and every answer that got it
 * wrong would only show up as a missing value at the call site.
 *
 * Nothing here is derived: every field is computed once in `DataViewBodyInner`
 * and merely re-homed. In particular `filter` / `sort` are the SAME controller
 * objects the row pipeline reads, so a control's summary and what actually
 * filters can never come from two different computations.
 *
 * Provided around **the toolbar only** — not around the view body. View children
 * have a deliberate contract (`DataViewRenderProps`), and an ambient back door to
 * `viewModel` would be a second, undocumented seam into the same state. Popovers
 * portal out of the DOM but stay React children, so the context still reaches
 * every panel opened from the toolbar.

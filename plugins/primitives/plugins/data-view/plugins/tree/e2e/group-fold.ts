/**
 * Verifies the grouped tree view's **per-group fold** — the unfold/fold button a
 * grouped `TreeView` hangs off each section header, beside the count.
 *
 * Separate from the tree primitive's own `subtree-fold.ts` because the two
 * buttons are owned by different plugins: the per-row fold is chrome every tree
 * row gets from `RowChrome`, while this one exists only when a DataView tree is
 * grouped, and is rendered by this plugin through `GroupedSections.headerActions`.
 * A script lives in the plugin it verifies.
 *
 * ## The guard that makes this worth a script
 *
 * The section header is ITSELF the section's collapse trigger. So a fold button
 * sitting on it is one stray click away from collapsing the very section it was
 * asked to fold — the whole design rests on `RowActions`' button `Stack`
 * stopping `onClick` and `onPointerDown`. Nothing types that guarantee, so the
 * assertion that the section is still OPEN after the fold is the only thing
 * holding it.
 *
 * The header's cluster is hover-revealed like a row's, so every interaction goes
 * header → `hover()` → button. Playwright calls an `opacity-0` element
 * "visible", so the reveal is asserted from computed opacity + pointer-events.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/primitives/plugins/data-view/plugins/tree/e2e/group-fold.ts \
 *     --url http://<worktree>.localhost:9000 [--headed]
 *
 * Pass `--url` explicitly: the harness derives its default from
 * `$SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, which in an agent shell reads `singularity` (main),
 * not the worktree this script is checked out in.

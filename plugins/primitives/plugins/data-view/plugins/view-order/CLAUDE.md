# view-order

Per-view-instance manual row order for **every** DataView — the Notion model:
manual order is the default, applying a sort overrides it, clearing the sort
restores it. No per-consumer wiring, no opt-in flag.

**A row order is a property of the view instance, not of the data.** The key is
`(dataViewId, viewId, rowKey)`: two view instances of the same surface hold two
different orders, and a `+`-created view can be arranged independently. Because
`viewId` is part of that key, every identity-bearing view config **must author an
explicit `id`** on each view row (enforced by the `config-stable-list-ids` check) —
a content-derived `auto-<hash>` id would shift on rename/filter-edit and orphan the
`data_view_row_order` rows keyed on the old id. That is why this lives in the
primitive rather than in each consumer's own rank column (the `DataViewProps.manualOrder`
seam, which a consumer owning a domain rank still uses and which still outranks
this contributor).

**Dependency direction: this child imports the parent (`view-order → data-view`),
never the reverse.** It contributes itself into the global
`DataViewSlots.RowOrder` slot; the host names no contributor. Structurally the
twin of `custom-columns` — a data-view child owning a generic DB table + push live
resource + one endpoint, injected back through a global slot.

## Model

- `data_view_row_order(data_view_id, view_id, row_key) → rank` (PK on the triple,
  index `dvro_view_idx` on the pair). `rank` is `rank_text` (C collation), the
  repo's fractional-index column type.
- `rowOrderResource` — push-mode, keyed `{ dataViewId, viewId }`, emitting
  `{ rowKey, rank }[]` rank-ascending. The loader reads the table, so the **L4 DB
  change-feed** recomputes it on every write; no notify / `dependsOn`. It ships
  only what was ever written — a view whose top three rows were arranged carries
  three rows, not the whole view.
- `POST /api/data-view/row-order` — the single endpoint. Body carries the drag's
  **bounded write set** (`writes: { rowKey, rank }[]`, rank-ascending), never the
  whole ordered key set. The server validates and upserts it; nothing is deleted.

## The seeding rule (the crux)

A row with no persisted rank yields `getRank → null`, which makes it undraggable
and produces a *mixed* section that `orderSectionsByRank` leaves under-specified
(its comparator returns `0` for any null pair). So `seedRanks` synthesizes a
**total** order: persisted ranks verbatim, then every unpersisted key appended
after `max(persisted)` **in source order**. Display-only — a seed is never written
as-is.

### Why a write is bounded, not a full replace

The naive incremental rule — persist **only** the moved row, re-seed the rest each
render — is **unstable**: an un-moved row's rank gets re-derived against an anchor
the move itself displaced, so rows A,B,C (none persisted) with C dropped between A
and B redisplay as **C,A,B**. (Seeding at the top fails symmetrically.)

The stability this needs is guaranteed by a single **standing invariant** that
`seedRanks` already maintains and every write must preserve:

> **Persisted rows always display before seeded rows.** The seeds are a suffix,
> in source order, appended after `max(persisted)`.

A write is stable as long as it leaves that invariant true — a *strictly smaller*
obligation than persisting the whole view. The rule (`computeMoveWrites`): let the
drag move row `X` before/after row `Y`, and let `next` be the post-move **display**
sequence.

> **Persist `X`, plus every seed that lies before `X` in `next`, in `next`'s
> order.** Everything after `X` stays seeded. Nothing is deleted.
> Writes = `1 + (seeds now ahead of X)`.

On the A,B,C case the write is `{ A, C }` — A materialized as C's anchor, then C
ranked after it; the next render re-seeds B after `max(persisted)` and the display
holds at `A,C,B`. The cost:

- a drag anywhere inside the already-arranged prefix → **1 row**;
- a drag to the top of a never-arranged 3666-row view → **1 row**;
- `O(|view|)` only for a drop *deep into the never-arranged tail* — where the user
  has, by definition, just declared an order for everything above the drop.

`onMove` passes `orderedKeys` in **source** order; `computeMoveWrites` derives the
display order itself and splices `X` there.

**The one subtle case.** The materialized set is chosen by **position in `next`**,
*not* by a source-order prefix of the same count. A seed dragged *downward* must
materialize the seeds that ended up ahead of it — reaching a source index *past*
`X`'s own; "the first `m` seeds in source order" would silently no-op that drag.
Pinned by `order-ops.test.ts` (downward-seed case + the A,B,C flip).

#### Why the rank arithmetic can neither throw nor collide

Materialized seeds rank `> max(persisted)`; `X` is ranked **last**, once its
predecessors exist. `pred` (the key before `X` in `next`) is always persisted by
construction, so it is a real rank. `succ` (the key after `X`) is read from
`persisted` — **not** the just-minted set — so a *seed* following `X` reads as
`null`: `X` becomes the new `max(persisted)` and the untouched seeds re-seed after
it, keeping the invariant. Hence `pred < succ` always holds, `Rank.between` never
sees an inverted or equal pair (cannot throw), and dense-fractional ranks cannot
collide with a sibling.

Ranks are minted **client-side** (`Rank.between` / `Rank.nBetween` in
`computeMoveWrites`), because the server cannot reproduce seeds — it does not know
the view's source order. Precedent: `computeFlatReorder` (`primitives/rank/core`)
mints client-side for the tree. Repeated `Rank.between` in the same gap grows key
length; same posture as the tree and pages ranks — no compaction job.

#### Semantics this changes

Only the **arranged prefix** freezes. Rows below it keep following the view's
natural source order, and a **new row sorts into that tail naturally** rather than
being appended last — arranging the top of a list no longer commits you to an
order for 3600 rows you never looked at.

#### `applyMove` operates on display order

`applyMove` splices `X` in the **display** order, not the source order — the order
the user actually drags in. The two coincide *only* while `persisted` is empty, so
splicing source order silently discards the previous drag's arrangement from the
second drag on. `computeMoveWrites` derives the display order internally (sorting
`orderedKeys` by `seedRanks`), so the caller keeps handing it source order; pinned
by the second-drag regression test in `order-ops.test.ts`.

### Why neighbour coordinates, not `dest.rank`

`ManualOrderConfig.onMove` carries both. `RankReorderProvider` computes
`dest.rank` against the **rendered** items, which under an active search are a
*subset* of the ordered set — a rank between two visible neighbours can land on
the wrong side of a hidden row. Re-inserting next to `dest.targetId` in the full
ordered key list is the correct global semantics and needs no client-side rank
arithmetic.

### Why the ordered set is filter-applied and search-excluded

The host hands this contributor `useFlatRows(rows, fields, { …state, sort: [],
query: "" })`. That removes the "reordering a subset" problem entirely:

- Rows the view **filters out** never receive a rank, so they never enter the
  computed display order and never appear in a write set.
- **Search** only affects what is *rendered*, never the ordered set. A drag under
  an active search still resolves against the full ordered set (both `id` and
  `targetId` are members, and `computeMoveWrites` derives the display order from
  it), so the moved row lands adjacent to its target *globally* and no hidden row
  is dropped. One write path — no `scopeComplete` flag, no fallback endpoint.
- Editing the view's filter changes the ordered set, but a bounded write never
  deletes: a row that leaves the view keeps its persisted rank and re-appears at
  its old slot if it returns (see Retention).

**Cost.** A drag writes `1 + (seeds now ahead of X)` rows — `O(gesture)`, not
`O(view)` — and the live resource carries only what was ever written. (The
predecessor full-replace rule turned one drag on `tasks-list`'s "Recent" view into
a **3666-row** write shipped to every client with the view open.) The one case
that still degrades to `O(|view|)` is a drop *deep into the never-arranged tail*;
the `computeMoveWrites` cost gates pin the boundaries (row 900 → top = 1 write;
row 0 → before row 900 = 900 writes).

## Row keys

`rowKey(row, 0)` is called with a **constant index**, because `FieldDef.value` gets
no index. A surface whose row keys are index-derived therefore cannot persist an
order (its keys would shift under the very reorder they encode) — the identical
edge case as `custom-columns`; every DataView in the repo passes an id-derived
`rowKey`.

While the live resource is `pending` the contributor renders `render(null)` — an
empty `persisted` map is indistinguishable from "never reordered", and seeding
from it would show pure source order and let a drag persist that as if it were the
user's arrangement.

## Retention

`data_view_row_order` is keyed by an opaque `rowKey` string, not an FK, so a DB
cascade is impossible: a deleted row leaves a stale order entry. There is
**deliberately no sweep** — neither `defineRetention` nor `markFirehose` — for the
same reason `data_view_custom_values` has none: the table is bounded by rows a
user actually dragged, not by a firehose. And no self-GC: a bounded write only
ever upserts, so a key that has left the view is simply left in place.

This is **display-safe**: `seedRanks` keys on membership in the ordered set, so a
stale entry is invisible to the display — its only trace is holding
`max(persisted)` slightly high, lengthening subsequent seed keys by a character or
two. It is also what makes the "a filtered-out row re-appears at its **old
persisted slot**" guarantee true.

The *only* durable reclaim path is the already-filed **generic data-view row GC**,
which this primitive cannot build alone (it cannot enumerate live `rowKey`s across
arbitrary consumers — that needs a way for a consumer to publish its live key
set). Identical posture to `data_view_custom_values`.

## Tests

- `core/internal/order-ops.test.ts` (bun:test, pure) — `seedRanks`, `applyMove`,
  `computeMoveWrites`: the A,B,C stability counterexample, the downward-seed case,
  the second-drag regression, the cost gates, and the **LCG round-trip property
  test** — the real stability gate: folding a random drag's `writes` into
  `persisted` and re-seeding reproduces the post-move display exactly, invariant
  intact.
  `bun test plugins/primitives/plugins/data-view/plugins/view-order/core`
- `server/internal/handle-set-row-order.test.ts` (bun:test, real DB via
  `db-test-fixture` + the real migration chain) — the bounded upsert: a key absent
  from a later write **survives** (nothing is deleted), rank-in-place update,
  C-collation ordering, duplicate-key 400, non-strictly-ascending / equal-rank
  400, per-`viewId` scoping. Requires the running embedded cluster and the applied
  migration (`./singularity build` first).

## Plugin reference

- Description: Per-view-instance manual row order for any DataView: subscribes to the persisted (dataViewId, viewId) ranks, synthesizes a total order, and contributes the resulting ManualOrderConfig back through data-view's global RowOrder slot. Persists a per-view-instance manual row order keyed by (dataViewId, viewId, rowKey): a generic DB table, a push live resource, and a validating upsert endpoint that writes only the drag's bounded set (the moved row plus the seeds now ahead of it) rank-ascending — O(gesture), never a full replace, nothing deleted.

/**
 * A primitive with an open passthrough has promised its callers ONE node:
 * everything they spread lands there, `ref` hands that same node back, and it
 * is still the same node tomorrow. This rule is what makes the promise true
 * inside the component body.
 *
 * The bug it exists for is not hypothetical and not rare. `Row` accepted an
 * open bag, spread it on "the rendered element", and rendered one element until
 * the day a caller passed `actions` — from then on a box wrapping a synthesized
 * `<button>`. So a `data-*` a caller used as a selector target moved from the
 * row box to the button, at a call site nobody edited, with no throw, no type
 * error and no test failure. `ViewportOverlay` shipped the other half of the
 * same defect: `ref={rootRef}` written AFTER `{...rest}`, which silently
 * discards the caller's ref.
 *
 * ## Counting elements is the wrong measure
 *
 * The tempting rule is "a primitive with a passthrough must render one
 * element". It is wrong in both directions: `Badge` and `OverlayPanel` render
 * two apiece and are correct, and `Row` rendered one and was wrong. What
 * matters is whether the bag and `ref` name the same node. That reframing is
 * what makes growth safe: wrapping `<Surface ref={ref} {...rest}>` in a new
 * outer `<div>` keeps them together and is fine; moving `ref` to the new
 * wrapper and leaving `{...rest}` on the inner element splits them, and that
 * exact shape is what this rule rejects.
 *
 * ## How it finds its subjects
 *
 * Through the TYPE CHECKER, not by matching `extends Passthrough` in the file:
 * the props parameter's type is asked for a string index signature
 * (`getStringIndexType()`). That is deliberate. `TabProps` is declared in
 * `ui/tab-bar/core/types.ts` while its three implementations live in three
 * other plugins, and a syntactic match would see none of them. Any props type
 * that is open — however it got that way — is in scope.
 *
 * The syntactic half of the gate: the props parameter is an object pattern
 * containing a rest element, and the function is named like a component (a
 * capitalised name). The name test keeps the rule off ordinary helpers that
 * happen to take an open record; its cost is that an anonymous inline component
 * (`memo(({ …rest }: Props) => …)`) is not seen.
 *
 * ## What the rest binding may do
 *
 * - **`restEscaped`** — the bag may only be spread as JSX, handed to
 *   `splitPassthrough` as its first argument, or asked for ONE named key
 *   (`rest.role`, the way `ToggleChip` checks whether the caller supplied a
 *   role before adding `aria-pressed`). `Object.entries(rest)`,
 *   `const props = { ...rest }`, `helper(rest)`, `rest[key]` in a loop —
 *   anything that derives from the bag by hand — puts the destination beyond
 *   what any reader (or this rule) can follow. That hand-rolled loop is
 *   literally how `Row` routed, and `splitPassthrough` is the same loop with
 *   the split NAMED.
 * - **`restFannedOut`** — one bag, one element. Spread onto a second element it
 *   is no longer a promise about one node, and duplicate `id`s / duplicate
 *   handlers are the visible symptom. Only spreads that can render TOGETHER
 *   count: `Row` returns one tree per path and spreads the bag in both, which
 *   is one destination written twice (see `mutuallyExclusive`).
 * - **`restOffRef`** — when the component destructures `ref`, the element
 *   receiving the bag must carry a `ref` attribute. This is the historical bug
 *   as a fingerprint: `ref` on an outer wrapper, `{...rest}` on an inner
 *   element.
 * - **`anchoredOffRef`** — `splitPassthrough`'s `anchored` half is the part that
 *   keeps the promise, so it is held to the same two conditions: on the `ref`
 *   element, exactly once. `routed` is deliberately unconstrained — naming it IS
 *   the statement that it goes to a second, deliberate destination.
 *
 * When `ref` is NOT destructured there is nothing to check: React 19 treats
 * `ref` as an ordinary prop, so it rides inside the bag and lands wherever the
 * bag lands. Co-location is automatic, which is why `Badge` (no `ref`
 * destructured, one `{...rest}`) is correct as written. The same reasoning
 * gates `anchoredOffRef`'s ref condition: with no `ref` binding, `ref` travels
 * in `anchored` unless the primitive's own predicate routes it away.
 *
 * ## What it checks about `ref`, and what it does not
 *
 * PRESENCE of a `ref` attribute on the receiving element, never its expression.
 * `OverlayPanel` writes `ref={panelRef}` where `panelRef` is a `useCallback`
 * composing the caller's ref with the scroll-fade and rail-guard refs — that is
 * correct, and deciding so from the syntax alone is not possible. A rule that
 * demanded the literal destructured identifier would reject every primitive
 * that has internal refs of its own, which is most of them.
 *
 * ## Accepted false negatives
 *
 * - A bag spread onto a COMPONENT that renders no DOM node swallows it
 *   silently, and no syntactic rule can see that.
 *   `trigger-render-safety/no-provider-trigger-render` covers the closest
 *   instance of that class (a provider as a base-ui `render` root).
 * - JSX assembled in a helper function outside the component body: the rest
 *   binding cannot reach it without tripping `restEscaped`, so the bag is safe,
 *   but a `ref` placed there is invisible here.
 * - Two spreads separated by a nested callback (one in the returned tree, one
 *   inside a `render` prop) read as two different rendered outputs, so they are
 *   not counted as a fan-out.
 * - A props type opened through an inherited type rather than `Passthrough`.
 *   The checker still sees it — that is the point of using the checker — but
 *   `no-anonymous-passthrough` cannot nudge at the declaration site.

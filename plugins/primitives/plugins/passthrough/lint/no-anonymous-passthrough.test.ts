/**
 * Tests for the `no-anonymous-passthrough` lint rule. Run with
 * `./singularity test plugins/primitives/plugins/passthrough`.
 *
 * The rule is purely syntactic, so this needs no TS program — unlike its
 * sibling `no-unanchored-passthrough`, whose test builds one.
 *
 * The valid cases are the calibration that matters: nine types in this repo
 * carry `[key: string]: unknown` for unrelated reasons (durable event payloads,
 * the plugin `Contribution` records) and must stay untouched, and the
 * `Passthrough` marker itself has to be able to declare the one index signature
 * the whole contract is built on. All of them are exempt by the same
 * construction — the rule fires only on a declaration named `*Props` — so there
 * is no allowlist anywhere, and these cases are what pins that.

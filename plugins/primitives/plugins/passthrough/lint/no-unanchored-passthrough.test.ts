/**
 * Tests for the `no-unanchored-passthrough` lint rule. Run with
 * `./singularity test plugins/primitives/plugins/passthrough`.
 *
 * ## The harness — the repo's first type-aware rule test
 *
 * The rule asks the TypeScript checker whether a component's props type has a
 * string index signature, so `RuleTester` has to hand the parser a real
 * program, not just a parser. Nothing here did that before — the other
 * type-aware rule, `button-safety/no-async-raw-button`, ships no test at all —
 * so this file is the precedent, and the shape is worth explaining.
 *
 * Each case is linted as a path that **does not exist on disk** (`case.tsx`
 * beside this file), type-checked through TypeScript's project service under an
 * inferred project. `projectService.allowDefaultProject` names that virtual
 * path, and `defaultProject` points at `tsconfig.case.json`, which is read for
 * its compiler options and nothing else. Each case's source IS the virtual
 * file's content, so there is nothing on disk to keep in step with it.
 *
 * That little config is a config, not a source file, and that is the whole
 * point: `type-check` requires every lintable `.ts`/`.tsx` in the repo to
 * belong to a tsconfig program, so the winning move is to have no `.tsx` to
 * place. Two details in it are load-bearing:
 *
 * - `types: []` — an inferred project otherwise pulls in every `@types` package
 *   it can see. With the repo root as the project root that took the first case
 *   from three seconds to five minutes.
 * - `include: ["*.ts"]` (this folder's rule sources) — TypeScript refuses to
 *   parse a config whose input set is empty, and typescript-eslint reports that
 *   as "Unable to parse the specified 'tsconfig' file". The inputs are never
 *   compiled; only the options are read. Those files already belong to
 *   `tsconfig.tools.json`, which is what type-checks and lints them; nothing
 *   discovers this config but this test.
 *
 * The first attempt was a small fixture project checked in beside this file
 * (`lint/fixtures/tsconfig.json` plus an empty `file.tsx` whose bytes the
 * RuleTester substituted). It worked, and it failed
 * `./singularity check type-check`: a `.tsx` in the repo that no tsconfig
 * program covers is invisible to type-checking and linting, and the check says
 * so out loud. The fix was to stop needing a file on disk, not to exempt one.
 *
 * `@typescript-eslint/rule-tester` has type-aware support built in and would be
 * the obvious third option; it is not a dependency of this repo, and the
 * project service reaches the same place with the packages already installed.
 *
 * Each case is prefixed with {@link PRELUDE} so the snippets declare a real open
 * props type — the rule would otherwise skip every one of them at the type gate,
 * and the suite would pass while testing nothing. The closed-type case
 * (`PlainProps`) is the negative control that pins the gate actually gating.
 *
 * The first invalid case is the acceptance test the rule exists for: the
 * historical `Row` / `ViewportOverlay` shape, with `ref` on an outer wrapper and
 * `{...rest}` on an inner element.

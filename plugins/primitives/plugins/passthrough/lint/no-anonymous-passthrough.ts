/**
 * An index signature written inline in a props type — `[key: string]: unknown`
 * inside `interface FooProps { … }` — opens a passthrough and says nothing
 * about where it lands.
 *
 * That is the whole bug this plugin exists for. `Row` shipped exactly this
 * signature, documented as "spread onto the rendered element", and rendered one
 * element right up until it was given `actions` — from which point a caller's
 * `data-*` selector target sat on an inner `<button>` instead of the row box.
 * No throw, no type error, and the call site that broke was not the call site
 * that changed. Spelling the passthrough as
 * `extends Passthrough` (`@plugins/primitives/plugins/passthrough/core`) states
 * the destination: `ref` NAMES the node, the bag ADDRESSES it, and they are
 * declared together so a props type cannot be open without exposing the node.
 *
 * This rule is the GATE, not the guarantee. The guarantee is
 * `passthrough/no-unanchored-passthrough`, which watches the rest binding
 * inside the component — and it finds its subjects through the type checker, by
 * asking whether the props type has a string index signature. A hand-written
 * index signature is perfectly visible to it. What is NOT visible is the
 * intent: without the marker there is no `ref` on the type, so the "which node?"
 * question has no answer to check against, and every new primitive re-decides in
 * private whether it has one. Requiring the marker makes the pair inseparable at
 * the declaration site, which is the only place it can be made inseparable.
 *
 * ## Why it keys on the NAME
 *
 * `[key: string]: unknown` is not by itself a React idiom. Nine types in this
 * repo carry it for unrelated, legitimate reasons — the durable event payloads
 * (`ConversationTurnCompletedPayload`, `RefAdvancedPayload`,
 * `TaskStatusChangedPayload`, the page/workflow/task table event rows) and the
 * plugin contribution records (`Contribution`, `ServerContribution`). Those are
 * open BAGS OF DATA, not props: nothing spreads them onto an element, there is
 * no node for a `ref` to name, and `extends Passthrough` would be a lie about
 * them. So the rule fires only on a declaration whose name ends in `Props`,
 * which is the repo-wide convention for exactly one thing.
 *
 * The `Passthrough` marker itself is exempt by the same construction — its name
 * is not `*Props` — so no path allowlist is needed to keep the definition site
 * from tripping its own rule.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT look at
 *
 * Only the DIRECT body of the `*Props` declaration. An index signature nested
 * inside a property (`interface FooProps { meta: { [k: string]: unknown } }`) is
 * a dictionary-shaped field, not the props passthrough, and is left alone.
 *
 * The value type must be `unknown` or `any` — the two spellings of "anything at
 * all". A narrower one (`[key: string]: string`) describes a dictionary the
 * component reads, not a bag it spreads.
 *
 * Accepted false negative: a props type that opens itself by extending some
 * OTHER open type of its own. The checker-driven second rule still sees such a
 * component, so the promise is still enforced on it; what is lost is the
 * declaration-site nudge.
 *
 * No auto-fix: the replacement needs an import added, and choosing between
 * `Passthrough` and `Passthrough<HTMLDivElement>` is a per-primitive judgement
 * (a mutable ref is invariant, so a primitive whose `ref` is narrower than
 * `HTMLElement` must say so).

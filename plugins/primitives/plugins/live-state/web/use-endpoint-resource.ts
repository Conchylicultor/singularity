/**
 * A GET endpoint read as a `ResourceResult` — the endpoint companion to
 * `useResource`, as `hydrateEndpoint` is to `hydrateResource`. `useEndpoint`
 * hands back React Query's own result, whose `data` is `undefined` both while
 * loading and after a first-load failure; a domain hook re-shaping that by hand
 * either collapses the two (a failed catalog renders as forever-loading) or has
 * to hand-write result arms. This is the one place that mapping is written:
 *
 * - `error` whenever the last fetch failed — with the value it held before as
 *   `stale`, if any (a failed refetch keeps React Query's data);
 * - `loading` while no value has landed and nothing failed;
 * - `ready` otherwise.
 *
 * The error is classified through the same `toResourceError` a live read's is,
 * so a surface renders both failures alike. The result is memoized on the
 * query's data / error identity, like `useResource`'s. The mapping is
 * `useQueryResource`'s (`queryResult`). Query options (`staleTime`, …) pass through, except
 * `enabled`: a disabled read would be `loading` forever.
 *
 * Lives here, not in endpoints, for the same reason `hydrateEndpoint` does:
 * live-state owns `ResourceResult` and already sits downstream of endpoints.

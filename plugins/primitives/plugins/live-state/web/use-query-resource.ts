/**
 * A LOCAL async load read as a `ResourceResult` — a code-split module
 * (`plugin-meta/exhibits` loads its exhibits this way), a browser API, any
 * promise that is not a read of the server. It is NOT a server read: a read of
 * server data is live — a `liveValue` (with `params`, a typed `query`, or
 * cursor-`paged`) or a `liveCollection`, read with `useLive`
 * (`network/live`) — so it refreshes itself when the data changes. There is
 * deliberately no form keyed by another read (a revision tick): that was the
 * hand-made freshness `network/live` replaced.
 *
 * React Query's own result hands `data: undefined` both while loading and
 * after a first-load failure, and its `isPending` / `isError` booleans let a
 * surface read `data ?? []` without asking which state it is in — the
 * pending-as-empty collapse. This turns it into the three arms every read
 * has, through the same mapping `useEndpointResource` uses:
 *
 * - `error` whenever the last fetch failed — the value it held before as
 *   `stale`, if any (a failed refetch keeps React Query's data);
 * - `loading` while no value has landed and nothing failed;
 * - `ready` otherwise (a `placeholderData` the caller opted into included).
 *
 * `enabled` is not an option: a disabled query is `loading` forever, the
 * spin-on-a-read-that-will-never-load bug.

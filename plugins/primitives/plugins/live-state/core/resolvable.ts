/**
 * A `Resolvable<T>` is a payload that can carry a value OR a first-class
 * "there is nothing to determine" answer. It is the **value-channel twin** of
 * the live-state pending/error gate, and the two split a payload's failure
 * modes cleanly:
 *
 * - `error` (on the `ResourceResult`) means *"we failed to determine the value;
 *   a retry may succeed"* — it is **transient** and, per the readiness gate,
 *   **unreachable** to consumers (a `pending` result never exposes `.data`).
 *   A loader signals this by **throwing**.
 * - `{ resolved: false }` means *"the server has a determinate answer, and the
 *   answer is: there is nothing to determine"* — it is **settled**: it renders,
 *   it stops retrying, and it is a legitimate value a consumer reads and
 *   narrows on.
 *
 * The load-bearing rule (invariant I2 of
 * `research/2026-07-09-global-resource-unknown-value-and-error-gate.md`): a
 * loader branch that cannot determine its value returns `unresolved(reason)`.
 * It must **never** return the empty value (`[]` / `0` / `null`) — that is an
 * absorbed failure indistinguishable from a genuinely-empty success — and it
 * throws only for *transient* failures. This also lets a descriptor's
 * `initialData` be a self-describing non-value (`unresolved("not loaded")`)
 * instead of a lie.
 *
 * `reason` is human-facing text rendered in the UI (e.g. "conversation has no
 * worktree"), so the settled non-value can explain itself to the user.

 * fails to parse, and `value` is validated by `inner` on the resolved arm.
 *
 * The `as` cast is unavoidable, not laziness: with a bare generic value schema
 * `inner: ZodType<T>`, Zod's object-output inference widens `value` to
 * `T | undefined` (its `addQuestionMarks`/`baseObjectOutputType` cannot prove a
 * generic `T` is never `undefined`), so the discriminated union is not provably
 * assignable to `ZodType<Resolvable<T>>`. The runtime shape is exactly correct;
 * only the type-level generic proof falls short. Mirrors `tolerantEnum`.

# rail

The chrome half of the outline primitive — Notion's right-edge minimap.

```tsx
<OutlineRail
  entries={entries}                                  // {id, label, depth}[]
  resolve={(id) => root.querySelector(`[data-block-id="${CSS.escape(id)}"]`)}
/>
```

The host owns only **what the entries are** and **how an id maps to a DOM node**.
Which entry is current, the disclosure, the overflow window and the scroll-to
belong to the rail. Renders `null` below two entries — a one-section outline is
noise.

## `resolve` must not reach outside its own surface

Not obvious from the signature, and it bites silently: the rail derives its
**IntersectionObserver root** from the scroll parent of the first element
`resolve` returns. So a `resolve` that can match another instance's DOM — two
panes open on the same document, ids that aren't globally unique — doesn't just
scroll the wrong pane on click. It watches the wrong scroller, and the
current-position highlight quietly tracks a surface the reader isn't looking at.

If your ids are unique per document but not per mounted instance, scope the query
to your own surface's container — ask your host for that element; don't climb the
DOM from a node planted for the purpose. The worked example is jsonl-viewer's
`usePaneScrollElement()`: the pane already held its scroll element and now
publishes it, so every overlay contributor gets the scoping, not just the outline.

## The host must provide the positioning context

The rail is a `<Pin to="top-right">`, so it anchors to its nearest `relative`
ancestor. Mount it inside one that spans the scrolling surface — an overlay slot
whose host is `relative`, not a box inside the scroller (the rail must not scroll
with the content).

It hangs from the **top** corner, not the vertical middle: the rail is the
document's index, so it starts where the document starts and grows down with it.
Centered, a five-entry outline floats in the middle of an empty margin with
nothing to relate to. The consequence for the host is that its top edge is the
rail's top edge — mount the rail below your pane header, not across it.

That same ancestor is what the rail **measures** (`el.offsetParent`) to decide how
many dashes fit. Measuring itself would be circular: its height *is* the dash
count.

## The panel replaces the dashes

Open, the dash stack clips to zero height — Notion's behaviour, and the reason
the outline's first row sits at the panel's top edge rather than under a dead
band. It is **clipped, never unmounted**: the dashes carry the position contract
below (read while the panel is open), and they are also the footprint
`FloatingAction` froze its hover hitbox to, so removing them from the layout
would leave the pointer over nothing and flicker the panel shut.

## The `footer` slot is a full-width, centered row

The rail owns that slot's layout, not the consumer. A footer that takes the
whole width (`w-full`) fills the row; anything narrower is centered in it. Do
not fix a small footer hit target in the consumer.

## Overflow: the rail windows, the panel does not

A 200-turn conversation cannot show 200 dashes. The rail paints at most
`floor(height / 8px)` of them, windowed around the active entry, and fades the
leading / trailing dash when something is genuinely hidden past it. The expanded
panel always lists **every** entry and scrolls.

Truncating the tail instead would put the active dash off the end of the rail —
the indicator would lie exactly when the document is long enough to need it.

## Why 8px is a raw number

`DASH_STEP_PX` (and its single mirror, `h-2` in `dash-stack.tsx`) is a fixed-height
box with the bar centered in it — deliberately not a bar plus a ramp gap.
Converting an available height into a dash count needs a step in pixels, and a
density-token gap would make that a guess that drifts with the active preset.

## Accessibility: the dashes are not the outline

The dash stack is `aria-hidden` with `tabIndex={-1}` buttons — a pointer
affordance and an indicator. The panel rows are the accessible outline
(`<button>` + `aria-current`), because exposing both would read every section
twice and cost a Tab stop each. The rail as a whole is still Tab-reachable:
`FloatingAction`'s wrapper takes focus and opens the panel.

## DOM contract (public — e2e scripts depend on it)

These attributes are **API**, not incidental markup. Restyle freely; do not rename
or drop them. Ids are the consumer's own strings, raw — callers `CSS.escape` at
query time.

| Attribute | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `data-outline-rail` | the `<nav>` root (one per rail; scope every query through it) |
| `data-outline-dash` + `data-outline-id` + `data-active="true\|false"` | every dash |
| `data-outline-row` + `data-outline-id` | every panel row `<button>`; the active one also carries `aria-current="true"` |

The dashes stay mounted while the panel is open (clipped to zero height), so
`[data-outline-dash][data-active="true"]` is readable in either state.

`aria-label` (the `label` prop, default `"Outline"`) lands on the same `<nav>`, so
`[data-outline-rail][aria-label="…"]` scopes to one instance when two surfaces are
on screen.

The panel opens on hover or focus of anything inside the rail: hover
`[data-outline-rail]`, or `.focus()` a dash (`tabIndex={-1}` still takes
programmatic focus, and the disclosure listens on `focusin`).

Panel rows and the `footer` are **always mounted** — `FloatingAction` marks the
closed panel `inert` and fades it out rather than unmounting it.

## Known edges

- `FloatingAction` freezes its hover hitbox to the panel's collapsed footprint
  once, at mount. The rail therefore waits for the first host measurement before
  mounting it, so the frozen box matches the real dash count — but a later pane
  **resize** changes the count without re-freezing, leaving the hitbox slightly
  stale. Cosmetic only: the panel is a DOM descendant of the wrapper, so pointer
  events still reach it.
- The open panel is `max-h-80` growing down from the stack's top. In a pane
  shorter than ~350px it can reach past the bottom edge and be clipped.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Notion-style outline rail: a dash per section pinned to the surface's right edge, the current one bright and wide (position from outline/scroll-spy), expanding on hover / focus / tap into the depth-indented outline with click-to-jump. Windows its dashes to the height it has while the panel always lists every entry, so a long document's indicator can never lie.

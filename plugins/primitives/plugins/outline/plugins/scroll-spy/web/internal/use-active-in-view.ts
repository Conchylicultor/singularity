 * visible long after you have moved past it.
 *
 * It also pairs with the hold-last-value rule to give the Notion reading

/**
 * Which of `ids` the reader is at, under one of two reading positions:
 *
 * - `"reading-line"` (the default) — the section being READ: the first id, in
 *   `ids` order, whose element sits in the top third of the scroller. This is
 *   what an outline highlights.
 * - `"furthest-read"` — how far the reader has GOT: the last id, in `ids` order,
 *   whose element is anywhere on screen. Everything above it has been scrolled
 *   past, so it is the point a running total can be reported "as of".
 *
 * Push-based by construction: elements report themselves through an in-view
 * watcher as they cross the band, so there is no scroll handler on the main
 * thread and nothing polls a position.
 *
 * The watcher is built ONCE and elements are enrolled incrementally as they
 * appear (rows mount and unmount as a streaming or virtualized surface scrolls) —
 * never rebuilt for new content. Rebuilding it per change (disconnect +
 * re-observe everything) would make each arriving row cost a full re-measure of
 * the whole document.
 *
 * `position` is the one exception, and it may change at runtime: the watcher is
 * retired and rebuilt when it does, because the band and the pick are fixed at
 * construction and cannot be renegotiated afterwards. The answer restarts from
 * the new position's first observation rather than carrying the old one over.
 *
 * Two rules that a hand-rolled copy reliably forgets, and that live here so that
 * no caller has to remember them:
 *
 * - **hold the last value when nothing is on screen** — an empty moment is a
 *   transient (mid-fling, a section taller than the band, a pane being torn
 *   down), not "the reader is nowhere". `null` is returned ONLY before the first
 *   observation lands, i.e. genuinely "not known yet";
 * - **enroll incrementally**, so a re-render never re-observes a node already
 *   watched. That one belongs to the watcher itself, which holds the `WeakSet`.
 *
 * The watcher `root` is DERIVED, not passed: the scroll parent of the first
 * element `resolve` returns. The entries live inside the scroller by
 * construction, so this is always right and the caller has one less prop to get
 * wrong.
 *
 * `resolve` returns `null` for an id whose element is not mounted (virtualized
 * or filtered away); that id is simply skipped and picked up on a later
 * enrollment pass.
 *
 * A host may report its sections BEFORE the surface renders them — every
 * consumer does — so "resolved nothing yet" is never terminal: a self-disarming
 * `MutationObserver` re-enrolls when the elements appear.
 *
 * Prefer a referentially stable `resolve` (a `useCallback`, or a module-level
 * function). An inline lambda is correct, just re-enrolls every render.

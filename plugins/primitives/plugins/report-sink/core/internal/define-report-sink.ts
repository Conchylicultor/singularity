// the registered handler is swallowed rather than propagated.
//
// A report emitted while no handler is registered is HELD, not dropped: the
// reporter usually registers from a mount effect, and a failure during boot
// fires before that effect has run. The next register(fn) replays the held
// reports in order, then delivers directly. The same holds for the gap after a
// handler unregisters (an HMR remount) — held, then replayed to its successor.
// register(null) discards whatever is held: a detach means nothing emitted
// before it should reach the next handler (in the app the hold is always empty
// at that point; in a test it keeps one case's reports out of the next).
//
// The hold is bounded — this is an error path, not a queue. It keeps the FIRST
// REPORT_SINK_HOLD_CAP reports (the first failures are usually the cause, the
// rest their cascade) and drops later ones, warning once per overflow.

  // tracking: native layout repositions it on every reflow, including a sibling

  // "Stable" means it never follows the OPEN panel — not that it is frozen. The
  // trigger is live content (a status dot that grows into a pill with a count),

  // hitbox left at the trigger's old size would leave the grown part of it

  // off the panel (which may be mid-morph): trigger size + the chrome measured
  // at rest. The derivation is size-only, so it holds for every `anchor`,
  // `direction` and `triggerAt` — the collapsed panel sits exactly on the
  // wrapper from whichever corner it is anchored at.
  //
  // While open, nothing is written: the hitbox holds still under the morph, and
  // a trigger that reshapes itself on open (the outline rail clips its dashes
  // away) cannot shrink it. `open` is a dep, so closing re-derives the footprint

/**
 * Disclosure-intent state machine for a hover-revealed control.
 *
 * Four independent open sources, OR-ed together, so no single source can
 * suppress another:
 *   - hover    — opens on pointer-enter, closes on pointer-leave after a grace
 *                delay. Re-entry ALWAYS cancels the pending close, so returning
 *                to the trigger reliably reopens — there is no timer "lock" that
 *                swallows a genuine re-entry (the dead-zone bug this replaces).
 *                Hover is the pointer being over the root's DOM box, read from
 *                NATIVE events — never React's synthetic enter/leave, which
 *                follow the React tree: a portaled overlay opened from inside
 *                (the element picker, a popover) counts as "inside" there, and
 *                when it unmounts under the cursor React synthesizes no leave
 *                at all, so hover stuck on and the open panel kept covering
 *                what was behind it. While hovered, every document pointer
 *                move re-checks containment, which catches that removal.
 *   - focus    — opens while KEYBOARD focus (`:focus-visible`) is anywhere
 *                inside the subtree, so the control is reachable by Tab, not
 *                mouse-only. A mouse click leaves its button focused; counting
 *                that would pin the panel open long after the pointer left.
 *                `:focus-visible` alone is not enough: a popover closed after
 *                any key (typing in it, Escape, a submit shortcut) hands focus
 *                back to its trigger, and Chrome marks that restored focus
 *                visible too. So the pointer outranks focus: a pointer moving
 *                outside the control ends a focus open exactly as it ends a
 *                hover open. Keyboard focus reopens it on the next focus
 *                event (a Tab).
 *   - latch    — a pointer-press while fully closed (the touch path, where
 *                there is no hover) pins it open until Esc or an outside press.
 *                Presses while already open are left to bubble to the content,
 *                so tapping an item inside never toggles the panel shut.
 *
 *   - held     — a popup opened from inside the panel (a popover, menu, select)
 *                is still open. That popup is drawn outside the panel's box,
 *                so reaching for it reads as a pointer-leave and a blur; `held`
 *                keeps the panel open under it. While held, Escape and presses
 *                belong to the popup: the panel ignores them, so closing the
 *                popup does not take the panel with it.
 *
 * Flicker (rapid open/close as the morphing panel's geometry shifts under the
 * cursor) is handled structurally by the caller pinning a stable hover hitbox,
 * plus the grace delay here — never by ignoring input.

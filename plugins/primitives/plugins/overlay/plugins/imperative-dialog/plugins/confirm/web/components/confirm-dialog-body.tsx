/**
 * Body of confirmDialog. Owns the error policy, because Button cannot: Button
 * auto-pends off a returned thenable but attaches only `.finally()`, so a rejected
 * onClick promise would escape as an unhandled rejection. runConfirm therefore
 * ALWAYS resolves (try/catch, no rethrow into Button). On failure it keeps the
 * dialog open and renders the message inline (the confirm button re-enables, so the
 * message IS the retry). A non-EndpointError also re-files the crash via
 * `void Promise.reject(err)` (fetchEndpoint already reported EndpointError to the
 * endpointErrorSink, so that one is only shown, not re-filed).
 *
 * ## Why the keyboard confirm takes a modifier
 *
 * ⌘/Ctrl+Enter confirms from anywhere in the dialog; a bare Enter deliberately
 * does not.
 *
 * Focus opens on Cancel, which is the right place for it — every action behind
 * this dialog is destructive, and the guidance for a destructive choice is that
 * it must not be the one a reflex reaches. A bare Enter would undo exactly that:
 * a person who hits Return out of habit, or who was typing when the dialog
 * appeared, would destroy the thing the dialog was asked to guard, with no undo.
 * So Enter keeps its plain meaning — activate whatever is focused, which is
 * Cancel — and the accelerator asks for a second key held down, which no reflex
 * supplies.
 *
 * It is bound here on the body rather than through the shortcut registry
 * because it must live and die with this one dialog, and only while it is the
 * thing the user is looking at.

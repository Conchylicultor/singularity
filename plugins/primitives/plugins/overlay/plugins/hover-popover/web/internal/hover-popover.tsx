 *

 * first control), and by a first tap on touch. Closed by Esc (focus returns to
 * the trigger), an outside press, or focus leaving the panel. The trigger's
 * own click is never intercepted on a pointer with hover, so a trigger can
 * navigate on click and preview on hover at once.
 *
 * Built on the controlled ui-kit `Popover`: base-ui owns positioning, the
 * portal, outside-press / Esc / focus-out dismissal and focus return; this
 * component owns only WHEN it is open. A click on the trigger never toggles it.

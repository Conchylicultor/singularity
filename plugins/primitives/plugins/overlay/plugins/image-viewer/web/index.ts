    "One full-screen image viewer for every image in the app: ViewerThumbnail (the capped inline thumbnail that always shows the whole image, with a tiny-icon shape and a size badge) and useImageViewerTrigger (for callers that keep their own <img>) open it; an image that does not load shows MissingImage (its name, and whether the file is gone or only unreadable, with Retry) and leaves the gallery — useImageLoad gives a caller with its own <img> the same load state, and useImageProbe answers it off-DOM for a caller that must know before it renders; ImageGallery makes every thumbnail inside one ← / → set in page order and renders the viewer inside its own React tree; ImageViewer is the controlled viewer itself — fit, click-to-close, wheel/pinch zoom, drag pan, minimap, copy/download/open, a docked thumbnail strip, a grid of every image with a tile-size slider, a control-less full-screen slideshow, keyboard-isolated. A ViewerThumbnail outside any gallery is its own gallery of one; useImageViewerTrigger requires one.",

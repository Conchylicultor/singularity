/**
 * no-core-define-route-in-web
 *
 * `defineRoute` is reachable from BOTH pane barrels — it is authored in `core/`
 * (runtime-agnostic: a server plugin builds the same app-rooted link from it)
 * and re-exported from `web/` so a pane file states its identity and its
 * behavior in one import. Two legal paths for one symbol is two spellings of
 * the same thing, which is the tax this re-export exists to remove; so the
 * canonical path is pinned per runtime:
 *
 *   • a file under `web/`  → `@plugins/primitives/plugins/pane/web`
 *   • a file under `core/` or `shared/` → `@plugins/primitives/plugins/pane/core`
 *
 * Only the first half is enforced here, because only the first half can happen:
 * the boundary config gives `core` the zone `["core"]`, so a `core/` or
 * `shared/` file importing the WEB barrel is already a hard `plugin-boundaries`
 * failure. A rule firing there would restate an error the checker already
 * raises. What is left is a `web/` file reaching past the barrel it is already
 * importing `Pane` from — legal to the boundary checker, and exactly the extra
 * import line this rule removes.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: it fires only on the `defineRoute` VALUE, only
 * on the pane core barrel's cross-plugin specifier, only in a `web/` runtime
 * folder. `import type { RouteDef }` / `{ normalizeRoutePath }` / `{ AppRef }`
 * from the core barrel stay legal in `web/` — those are not re-exported here,
 * so there is no second spelling to choose between.
 *
 * The pane plugin's own tree is exempt (see OWNER_PLUGIN_DIR): its correct
 * spelling is the relative `../core`, and the barrel doing the re-export must
 * not be flagged for performing it.

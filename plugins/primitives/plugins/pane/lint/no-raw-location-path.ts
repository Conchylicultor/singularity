/**
 * no-raw-location-path
 *
 * The route path must be read through `currentRoutePath()` from
 * `@plugins/primitives/plugins/pane/web` (or the pure `normalizeRoutePath()`
 * from `.../pane/core`), never raw `window.location.pathname`.
 *
 * The address bar is untrusted input, and a raw pathname carries whatever the
 * user typed or a bad link supplied. A pathname with a repeated slash fails in
 * two silent, unrelated-looking ways:
 *
 *   • As a HISTORY URL it is *scheme-relative*. `replaceState(s, "",
 *     "//agents/c/x")` resolves to `http://agents/c/x` — a different origin —
 *     and throws SecurityError, taking down boot on a deep link.
 *   • As a MATCH KEY it misses. `"//agents/c/x".startsWith("/agents/")` is
 *     false, so the URL owns no app and the deep link silently falls back to
 *     the default app.
 *
 * Both come from reading the pathname raw, which is why the fix is a single
 * canonical reader rather than a fix at either failure site.
 *
 * Detection is leaf-based (like `apps-core/no-raw-history-nav`): any
 * MemberExpression `<…>.pathname` whose object chain ends in `location`. That
 * covers `location.pathname`, `window.location.pathname`,
 * `document.location.pathname`, and `self.location.pathname` in one check.
 * `location.href` / `.search` / `.hash` are not matched — they are not route
 * paths and have no app-matching or history-URL role.
 *
 * The sanctioned reader itself and the eager boot root escape per-site via
 * `// eslint-disable-next-line pane/no-raw-location-path -- reason`; test and
 * e2e trees are exempted wholesale (see lint/index.ts).

/**
 * Tests for the `no-core-define-route-in-web` lint rule. Run with
 * `./singularity test plugins/primitives/plugins/pane`.
 *
 * The rule pins ONE import path for `defineRoute` per runtime: a `web/` file
 * takes it from the pane WEB barrel (which re-exports it), everything else from
 * the pane CORE barrel. Every case sets `filename` explicitly — the runtime
 * folder IS the rule's input, so a case without one would test nothing.

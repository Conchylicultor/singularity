 * `reorder`'s per-slot config registrations are (`reorder/web/internal/
 * config-registrations.ts`), and for the same two reasons: the set is not
 * knowable at module eval (`Pane.define` runs at the module scope of each pane's
 * own plugin, and web plugins load in deferred tiers), and a slot is only NAMED
 * by a declaration pass — which runs inside `PluginProvider` immediately before
 * it reads every plugin's `contributions`, so re-deriving there is exactly in
 * time, every time.
 *
 * De-duped by slot identity, so a header borrowed by five panes gets exactly one
 * title item rather than five.
 *
 * Order: `bySlot` preserves the topo-sorted plugin order, and a plugin can only
 * contribute to a pane's header by importing the plugin that owns the pane,
 * which imports this one — so `pane` is always visited first and the title lands
 * FIRST in every header's natural (unconfigured) order, which is where a pane
 * title goes. Anything else is the user's reorder config, as it should be.
 *
 * Built here (not in the barrel) so `web/index.ts` stays loop-free per the
 * barrel-purity rule.

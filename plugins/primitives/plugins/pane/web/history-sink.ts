// HistoryAdapter — the seam that keeps the pane primitive app-agnostic.
//
// The pane store is the single source of truth for what is on screen; the
// browser URL + `history.state` are a pure PROJECTION of it. The store never
// touches `window.history` directly. Instead it emits push/replace *intents*
// through the installed `HistoryAdapter`:
//
//   • setRoute / navigatePending  →  historyAdapter.commit(change)
//   • real browser back/forward   →  historyAdapter.restore()
//
// Standalone (and in tests) the `defaultHistoryAdapter` writes the pane's route
// payload verbatim and restores it straight back into the live store — today's
// behavior, unchanged. The tabs layer installs an app-aware adapter (via
// `setHistoryAdapter`) that additionally stamps `{ tabId, appId }` into each
// entry so a history entry is a COMPLETE snapshot of what the user was looking
// at, and restores the whole snapshot (refocus the tab, re-sync its app,
// restore the route) with zero URL parsing. See the pane + tabs CLAUDE.md.

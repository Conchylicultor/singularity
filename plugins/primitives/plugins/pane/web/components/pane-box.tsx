 * conversation — and `Pane.define({ app })` already names the one app it belongs
 * to. Reading the scope off that declaration is what makes a page pane look like
 * Pages wherever it is opened, instead of taking on its host's palette.
 *
 * Note this only *tags* the subtree. Whether the tag changes anything is
 * theme-engine's business: an app that has forked its theme emits a matching
 * `[data-theme-scope="app:<id>"]` block (centrally, one per registered app), and
 * an app that has not emits nothing and inherits `:root` as before.

/**
 * The DOM box that **is** a pane — the single sanctioned way to paint one.
 *
 * A pane's box carries two ancestry-derived signals, and both have to be stamped
 * twice: once on the box for DOM-walking readers, and once as context for the
 * portaled content (popovers, menus, tooltips) that leaves the box behind:
 *
 *  - `data-pane-id` — which pane contains this element (render-loop attribution,
 *    overscroll-hint, the element picker, e2e).
 *  - `data-theme-scope` — whose theme this subtree wears ({@link paneThemeScope}).
 *
 * The theme half is exactly what `<Theme>` is: the attribute, the portal forward
 * that carries it, and the canvas it paints, as one thing that cannot be
 * half-assembled. The pane id has no such primitive — it is a second, unrelated
 * forwarded signal — so its two stampings stay written out here.
 *
 * `surface="canvas"` because the box PAINTS its canvas, it does not merely
 * resolve the token for it. Scoping `--background` here changes nothing on its
 * own: the element that fills the surface is the tab container, which sits ABOVE
 * this box and therefore resolves `--background` in the HOST app's scope. A
 * transparent pane then shows the host's canvas no matter whose theme its own
 * subtree carries. Same role the placement paints, so where scope and host agree
 * this is a no-op repaint.
 *
 * Layout renderers own where the box sits and how big it is (`className`,
 * `style`, `ref`); they do not own its identity. Bundling the stamping with the
 * render of the pane component itself is what keeps a new layout renderer from
 * silently shipping panes that report no pane id and inherit their host's theme
 * — there is no exported way to paint a pane without its box.

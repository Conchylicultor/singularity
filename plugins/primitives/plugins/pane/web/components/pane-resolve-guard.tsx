 * scroll, focus, and unsaved editor draft (the debounce timer is cleared on
 * unmount without flushing), then remount cold on recovery. The mounted body
 * reads its own data and renders that failure where it lands.
 *
 * Before the first `found`, each state gets its own chrome: `pending` a
 * spinner, `error` the failure with its Retry (ResourceErrorInline), and a
 * determinate miss Not Found. The gate downgrades a found pane only on a
 * SETTLED miss (`missing`): a resource genuinely deleted while its
 * pane is open still surfaces Not Found — stickiness masks transient failures,

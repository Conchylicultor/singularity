// Scripted end-to-end check that every app's bare root resolves to its index
// pane (see the "The app's index pane (`appIndex`)" section in the pane
// CLAUDE.md).
//
// `appIndex` is the one pane field with NO static enforcement in either
// direction that matters here. Registry sync throws loudly on a segment-bearing
// index pane and on a second index for one app (`useSyncPaneRegistry`), but a
// pane that simply LOSES its `appIndex: true` is silent: the field is optional,
// `pane:segments-unique` skips empty segments, and `type-check` sees nothing.
// The only symptom is that the app's bare root paints an empty main area — so
// the only way to catch it is to open each root and look.
//
// That made it the riskiest single field in the route-form migration, which
// moved every pane's `segment` onto its `RouteDef` while `appIndex` stayed on
// `Pane.define`.
//
// An app is asserted here iff it HAS an index pane. There is deliberately no
// global fallback — `home`, `studio`, `browser`, `file-explorer` and `debug`
// render an empty main area at their bare root, which is a legitimate choice.
//
// Manual, self-contained — NOT wired into any check (tests are manual here):
//
//   ./singularity run plugins/primitives/plugins/pane/e2e/app-index-sweep.ts \
//     [--url <deploy>] [--wait <ms>]
//
// Exit 0 = all pass; exit 1 = a failing assertion (with a printed reason).

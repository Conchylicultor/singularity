/**
 * Pins the capability `PaneBox` exists for: **a pane wears its home app's theme,
 * not its host's.**
 *
 * `Pane.define({ app })` names the app a pane belongs to, and panes are reusable
 * chrome — the agent manager hosts the page detail beside a conversation. Before
 * `PaneBox`, the only `data-theme-scope` on screen was the TAB's, so a page pane
 * opened at `/agents/page/<id>` was painted with the agent manager's palette. The
 * box now stamps the pane's own scope, nested inside the tab's.
 *
 * What is asserted, on `/agents/page/<id>` (a Pages pane hosted by the agent
 * manager) with `/pages/page/<id>` (the same pane at home) as the control:
 *
 *  0. Non-vacuity: the page pane really rendered — the probe is looking at a
 *     pane, not at an empty route or a redirect back to Pages.
 *  1. The pane's box carries `data-theme-scope="app:pages"`.
 *  2. That box is a DESCENDANT of the tab's `app:agents` scope — i.e. the page
 *     is genuinely hosted by the agent manager, not navigated away to Pages.
 *     Without this, assertion 1 would also pass on a redirect.
 *  3. The scope has a visible CONSEQUENCE, which is the half a DOM attribute
 *     cannot show. The script injects the exact block a forked Pages theme emits
 *     (`[data-theme-scope="app:pages"] { --background: … }`) and reads back the
 *     pane's PAINTED background — its computed `background-color`, not the
 *     custom property. That distinction is the whole assertion: the token alone
 *     changes nothing, because the element filling the surface is the tab
 *     container above the pane, which resolves `--background` in the HOST's
 *     scope. A pane that resolves the right value and paints none of it looks
 *     exactly like a pane with no theme at all. The host's own canvas must NOT
 *     move. Injecting rather than forking the real config keeps the run
 *     read-only — the probe exercises theme-engine's mechanism without writing a
 *     user's theme.
 *  4. Control: at `/pages/page/<id>` the same pane still reports `app:pages`,
 *     so assertion 1 is about the pane's home and not about being a guest.
 *  5. The same thing asserted for the whole CLASS rather than for this one pane:
 *     NO theme boundary anywhere on screen is half-themed — re-theming a subtree
 *     while painting none of it, so the fill the user sees belongs to an
 *     ancestor in the ancestor's palette. `PaneBox` is the site that bug was
 *     found at, not the only site that could have it, and every instance of it
 *     is invisible until someone looks at a screenshot. See
 *     {@link sweepBoundaryPaint} for why the assertion is phrased that way and
 *     not as the blunter "every boundary paints".
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

/**
 * Every theme boundary on screen, classified by whether it leaves the user
 * looking at someone else's theme.
 *
 * The failure being swept for is not "transparent" — it is **half-themed**: an
 * element that re-themes its subtree and paints none of it, so the fill the user
 * actually sees is an ancestor's, in the ancestor's palette, under text that
 * reads the new one. That is the exact shape `PaneBox` shipped with, and stating
 * it that way is what makes the sweep able to cover every site instead of one.
 *
 * So a transparent boundary is only a failure when the nearest thing that DOES
 * paint behind it wears a different scope. Two consequences, and both are the
 * definition rather than an exemption bolted on:
 *
 *  - The toaster host needs no special case. It declares `surface="none"`, and
 *    the chrome canvas behind it wears the very scope it stamps — nothing is
 *    mis-themed, which is why painting there would be wrong rather than merely
 *    unnecessary.
 *  - Neither do the in-tree portal CARRIERS. An `AdaptiveBar` occupant container
 *    and a `SurfaceOverlay` root re-stamp the whole forwarded attribute bag —
 *    theme scope included — onto a box that is deliberately transparent. They
 *    carry a boundary declared elsewhere rather than declaring one, and nothing
 *    in the DOM tells them apart from a declaration today; keying on what the
 *    user can SEE sidesteps having to.
 *
 * Two things are left out of the walk entirely. Anything portaled to
 * `document.body` — every popover / menu / tooltip positioner and every
 * `ViewportOverlay` root — is a carrier by construction, since a boundary is
 * declared inside the app tree, so the sweep starts at `#root`. And an element
 * with no box is skipped, because nothing shows through a zero-area box.

// Scripted end-to-end check that a RELATIVE open carries the ancestor params
// the caller supplied — the runtime half of "an open never discards a param the
// caller supplied".
//
// `openPane(target, params, { mode: "push" })` takes the target route's CHAINED
// param set, and tsc requires every one of them. The push path used to build the
// target's slot from `extractOwnParams` alone, so an ancestor's `:param` was
// accepted at the call site and then dropped — leaving the target in a route
// without its declared ancestor, a URL missing that ancestor's segment, and a
// pane whose Expand re-rooted into `buildRouteUrl` and threw AFTER `setRoute`
// had already committed. Which of the two happened depended only on WHERE the
// clicked row was rendered: from global chrome (no caller pane) the params were
// honoured, from inside a pane they were not.
//
// The one live instance is a deploy row. `deploymentDetailPane` chains under
// `server/:serverId`, and the merged runs list renders in three places — the
// build button's popover (global chrome), the build pane, and the backup pane.
// This drives the BUILD PANE, i.e. the path that used to drop the id.
//
// Two assertions, and the second is why this is not just "the URL looks right":
// the paramful ancestor (`deploy-server-detail`) must be materialized, and the
// PARAMLESS one (`deploy-servers`, the app index) must NOT — a relative open
// inserts only ancestors that carry something, or every task chip would drag the
// whole tasks tree in beside it.
//
// Manual, self-contained — NOT wired into any check (tests are manual here):
//
//   ./singularity run plugins/primitives/plugins/pane/e2e/push-carries-ancestor.ts \
//     [--url <deploy>] [--wait <ms>]
//
// Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = a failing assertion (with a printed reason).

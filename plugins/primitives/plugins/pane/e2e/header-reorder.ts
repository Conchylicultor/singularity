/**
 * Pins the capability the one-pane-header-slot refactor exists for
 * (`research/2026-08-21-global-one-pane-header-slot.md`): **a pane header's
 * items are reorderable**.
 *
 * Before it, a pane's `Actions` were painted by `useContributions()` +
 * `renderIsolated` rather than by the slot's own `.Render`, so the reorder LIST
 * middleware never ran: ordering, hiding and spacers were silently ignored on
 * every one of the ~106 pane headers, even though each owed a config directive.
 * Nothing failed — the directives simply had no effect, which is precisely the
 * kind of absence a screenshot cannot show. The header now renders through
 * `.Render` inside an `AdaptiveBar`, so its items are sortable dnd-kit items
 * like any other reorderable slot's.
 *
 * What is asserted, per surface:
 *
 *  0. Edit mode OFF ⇒ the header band holds ZERO sortables. This is the
 *     baseline that makes the ON reading mean "edit mode did it" rather than
 *     "something in this band is always sortable".
 *  1. Edit mode ON ⇒ the band holds sortables at all (non-vacuity: without this
 *     every count below could be a mis-scoped locator reading an empty band).
 *  2. Every header CONTRIBUTION in the band is itself a sortable item — not
 *     merely inside one, and not merely some of them.
 *  3. The band's sortables are EXACTLY the contributions plus the reorder
 *     config's spacers, so no count is left unexplained.
 *  4. Edit mode OFF again ⇒ back to zero, and the session is left as it was
 *     found.
 *
 * Edit mode MUST be on for any of this to be visible: `SortableReorderItem`
 * passes `disabled={!editMode}`, dnd-kit hands back no listeners when disabled,
 * and `SortableItem` then spreads no attributes — so the
 * `aria-roledescription="sortable"` marker is absent outside edit mode. Step 0
 * asserts that absence rather than assuming it.
 *
 * Three surfaces, because a pane header came in three shapes:
 *
 *  - `/events/sources` — an ORDINARY pane whose header is its plain `Actions`
 *    slot. This is the surface the refactor is for, and the only one that
 *    discriminates: run this script against the pre-refactor deploy
 *    (`--base http://singularity.localhost:9000`) and this pane reports
 *    `sortables in band=0` with edit mode ON, because `renderIsolated` painted
 *    its actions outside the list middleware. Every other pane in the app that
 *    is not a rich custom header is this one.
 *  - the Sonata player — the pane's own header slot carrying a rich set of
 *    contributions (transport, volume, transpose, …).
 *  - `/website/apps` — a SHARED `definePaneHeaderSlot()` borrowed by the site's
 *    inner pages: one slot, several panes, one config directive. (The website's
 *    own homepage is deliberately NOT one of them — it wears no header at all —
 *    so this surface must stay an inner page, never `/website`.)
 *
 * The last two were `chrome.header` custom toolbars before the refactor, whose
 * `Start`/`End` zones already rendered through `.Render`; they are here because
 * the refactor collapsed all three shapes into ONE slot, and "the rich headers
 * still reorder" is the half of that claim a regression would break silently.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

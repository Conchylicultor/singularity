 *
 * Then READ THE DIFF before committing. The manifest is not derived truth — it
 * is the reviewed RECORD of what every pane's id, segment, `appIndex` and parent
 * are, and regenerating it is how you assert those are the values you meant. A
 * line you did not expect is the bug the check exists to catch, and rewriting
 * the file is exactly what makes it stop being caught.
 *
 * Reads the WORKING TREE (the check reads the tree the cache is keyed on), so
 * the two agree on a clean checkout and the manifest is written from what you
 * are about to commit.

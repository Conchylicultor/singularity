/**
 * The renderer of the `"row"` rung: a labelled row in the overflow panel
 * instead of a ghost icon button. The twin of `IconButton`'s full form,
 * selected between by the region's answer to `useActionForm`, never by the call
 * site.
 *
 * **It renders standalone** — no menu, no popover, no context of any kind above
 * it — and that is the whole point. The panel that hosts relocated widgets is
 * always mounted (it holds their live DOM: a Web Audio volume control, a jog
 * wheel mid-drag), so it can never be a `DropdownMenuContent`, which unmounts
 * its children on close. It is a plain dialog, and `role="menu"` would be wrong
 * there anyway: a menu's roving tabindex and typeahead eat the arrow keys a
 * relocated `role="slider"` needs. The honest cost is that the panel has no
 * typeahead and no arrow-key roving — it is Tab + Enter + Esc.
 *
 * `Row` is the right primitive here for exactly that reason: it stamps **no
 * `role`**, so it cannot turn this into a `menuitem` — it is a plain
 * `<button type="button">` named by its `<Text>` child. (It also stamps no
 * `aria-current`, which needs `selected`, which this row never passes.)
 *
 * This row once composed `Line` and hand-copied `Row`'s chrome, because
 * `Row → row-actions → IconButton → action-presentation` was a cycle
 * `./singularity check plugin-boundaries` rejects. That edge is gone:
 * `row-actions` shipped an `IconButton` alias whose deletion dropped `Row`
 * below `icon-button`. See
 * `research/2026-08-17-global-row-usable-below-icon-button.md`.

    "The shrink-ladder seam between a widget and the bar that hosts it: useActionForm declares the smaller forms a widget can render ITSELF as (and how eagerly it yields room to its neighbours) and reads back the form the region assigned — one hook, both directions. A region can only hand a widget a form that widget declared, so a rich control can never be transformed into something it is not; PanelActionRow renders the 'row' rung, the one IconButton declares — a labelled row that stands alone in the always-mounted overflow panel, never a menu item.",

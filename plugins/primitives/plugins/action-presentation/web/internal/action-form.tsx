 * const form = useActionForm({ shrinksTo: ["compact"], yields: "early" });
 * if (form === "compact") return <IconButton icon={Icon} label="Volume" onClick={toggleMute} />;
 * return <VolumeSlider …/>;
 * ```
 *
 * INVARIANT — **the returned form is one this caller declared, or `"full"`.**
 * It is enforced here rather than trusted of the region, for two reasons. The
 * cheap one: the assignment arrives through context, so it is already committed
 * on the render where the declaration is still only queued in an effect, and a
 * widget that had not yet said "I can be a labelled row" must not be asked to be
 * one for that one frame. The load-bearing one: this is what makes "a jog wheel
 * becomes a labelled row" structurally unrepresentable rather than a rule
 * written in prose — no region, present or future, can hand a form to a widget
 * that never offered it.
 *
 * A widget that calls this with nothing gets a one-rung ladder: the region may
 * leave it alone or relocate it as itself, never transform it. Calling it not at
 * all is the same thing, so a contributor who never heard of this seam is safe.
 *
 * THE OTHER HALF OF THE PROMISE — **declaring a form commits you to rendering
 * something as it.** Returning `null` when the region hands you the form you
 * asked for is not "shrinking to nothing"; it is a control disappearing, which
 * is the one transformation this seam exists to prevent. A region cannot tell
 * that apart from a contribution that renders nothing at all until it has
 * already put the widget there, so it costs a wasted round and a filed report
 * (`adaptive-bar`'s `empty-rung`) before it stops offering the form.
 *
 * Which means a form you cannot render **right now** — data still loading, a
 * permission missing, an empty list — should not be declared right now. The
 * declaration is a live subscription re-run whenever the ladder's value changes,
 * so `shrinksTo: items.length > 0 ? ["compact"] : []` is both legal and the
 * intended spelling; a region invalidates everything it had learned about a
 * widget whose rung set really changed.

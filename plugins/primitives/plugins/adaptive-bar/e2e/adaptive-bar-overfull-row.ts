/**
 * The proof no other suite can give: a bar whose **row is merely over-full** —
 * so its own cell resolves to exactly 0px while fully laid out — is **still
 * deciding** afterwards. It did not read that 0 as the shrink-wrap ratchet's
 * terminal state, file a `no-slack` fault, and latch the degraded ceiling
 * (everything back in the row, CSS clipping, and never an eviction again) for
 * the life of the mount.
 *
 * Why a healthy bar measures 0 at all: the bar declares itself `min-w-0 flex-1`,
 * i.e. `flex: 1 1 0%`, which is what makes its own
 * `getBoundingClientRect().width` the room it was given. When the row's OTHER
 * cells over-fill their container, free space is negative — and a cell whose
 * flex base size is 0 has no basis on which to absorb a share of the shrinkage,
 * so it resolves to 0px while generating a perfectly ordinary box. Nothing is
 * wrong with that host. There is simply no room at this width, and there will be
 * again when the row widens.
 *
 * Until `research/2026-08-18-global-adaptive-bar-zero-width-recovery.md` the bar
 * accused the host on that number. It now re-admits every occupant, clears the
 * premise watermark and re-asks the differential probe: a shrink-wrapping host
 * then measures its own content and is faulted in the words that name the
 * defect, while an over-full row finds nothing evicted on the next pass, latches
 * nothing, and files ONE non-latching note saying its row is over-full. This
 * script drives the second case in a real engine.
 *
 * Why the other three suites cannot express it:
 *
 * - `core/*.test.ts` has no layout engine at all — negative free space is not a
 *   number the fit is ever handed.
 * - `web/__tests__/` (jsdom) models the over-full row through the primitive's
 *   own measurement seam: the test supplies 0 as a width, which is the thing
 *   under test being asserted rather than observed. Only a real engine decides
 *   that a `flex: 1 1 0%` cell in an over-full row is 0 *and* still laid out.
 * - `./singularity check layout-geometry` mutates synchronously and never
 *   reverts: its style writes are one-shot with no restore phase, and the bar's
 *   resize callback is RAF-debounced — so an inject-then-remove inside one task
 *   coalesces into no observation at all, and the 0px pass this script exists to
 *   force never runs.
 *
 * Route-agnostic: it drives WHATEVER URL it is pointed at and discovers every
 * adaptive bar the route happens to render, so it doubles as a "do this route's
 * bars survive a cramped row" check for any app.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

/**
 * The proof no other suite can give: a bar whose ancestor is hidden with
 * `display: none` and then shown again is **still deciding** — it did not latch
 * the degraded ceiling (everything back in the row, CSS clipping, and never an
 * eviction again) on the 0px it measured while it generated no box.
 *
 * Keeping a surface mounted but not rendered is this app's general contract, and
 * every spelling of it is `display: none` — an unfocused tab
 * (`apps-core/surface`'s `surface-body.tsx`, the mechanism this script copies),
 * a minimized floating window, a collapsed miller column. So an ordinary bar in
 * an ordinary app gets hidden and shown many times a session, and each hide is a
 * chance to latch.
 *
 * Why the other three suites cannot express it:
 *
 * - `core/*.test.ts` has no layout engine at all — it is the fit math, and
 *   "the row generates no box" is not a number the fit is ever handed.
 * - `web/__tests__/` (jsdom) models the hide through the primitive's own
 *   measurement seam: the test supplies 0 as a width, which is exactly the
 *   thing under test being asserted rather than observed. Only a real engine
 *   decides what a `display: none` subtree measures, and only a real engine
 *   fires the `ResizeObserver` that drives the pass.
 * - `./singularity check layout-geometry` mutates synchronously and never
 *   reverts: the harness's style writes are one-shot with no restore phase, and
 *   the bar's resize callback is RAF-debounced — so a hide-then-show inside one
 *   task coalesces into no size change at all, and the hidden pass this script
 *   exists to force never runs.
 *
 * Route-agnostic: it drives WHATEVER URL it is pointed at and discovers every
 * adaptive bar the route happens to render, so it doubles as a "does this
 * route's bars survive being backgrounded" check for any app.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

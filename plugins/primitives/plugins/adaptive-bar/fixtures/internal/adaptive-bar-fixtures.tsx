/**
 * The proof surface.
 *
 * Every surface this primitive can reach in its first pass — pane headers, the
 * authored reorder bucket, the tab strip — is made of plain actions, so none of
 * them exercises the premise: *a draggable widget relocates and is still
 * draggable*. The layout harness does, and it is a genuinely good fit rather
 * than a workaround: it renders real components with real Tailwind, sweeps each
 * fixture across a range of container widths in a real headless Chromium, and
 * judges the measured `[data-geo]` boxes through a generic oracle that never
 * names a primitive's internals.
 *
 * What the sweep proves here: at every width, no two occupants overlap and
 * nothing — including the `⋯` trigger — spills past the row it was given. The
 * bar is the grow cell of a full-width line, so its right edge IS the
 * container's: "nothing clips the container" and "the bar never overshoots its
 * parent" are the same assertion measured once.
 *
 * What the sweep can NOT prove is that the relocated slider still drags, or
 * that it is the same instance afterwards — geometry has nothing to say about
 * either. That is `e2e/adaptive-bar-relocate.ts`, driving this same fixture in
 * the live Layout Lab.

 *   A positioned card would become the `offsetParent` itself and the old
 *   predicate would answer correctly — the fixture would pass either way and
 *   prove nothing.
 * - **The card carries its own `data-geo="container"`, and the spacer carries
 *   no `data-geo` at all.** `__measure` prefers the INNERMOST container, so
 *   `noClip`/`noOverlap` are judged against the card the bar actually lives in

 * widths — each one has to put the bar in a specific state. At every swept width
 * the row must (a) hold at least one occupant, since a probe that hides nothing
 * measures nothing, (b) have evicted at least one, since a full row is not using
 * less than it was given, and (c) still leave a band of UNUSED room wider than
 * the primitive's own `HYSTERESIS_PX`, since that unused room is exactly how far
 * the row narrows when the host stops handing it a width — and a narrowing
 * smaller than the hysteresis band is not a resize as far as the bar is
 * concerned.
 *
 * So the width is computed from the state it is meant to produce rather than
 * picked: `n` occupants inline, each followed by a gap (the last one by the gap
 * before the `⋯`), then the trigger, then the slack band. The occupants are a
 * fixed pixel width for the same reason — a text-sized chip makes every number
 * here a function of the font, and the row is being measured to the pixel.
 *
 * `ROOM_GAP_PX` and `ROOM_TRIGGER_PX` are measured off the harness's own seeded
 * default density ramp (`gap="xs"`, one `IconButton`) rather than derived, which
 * is the one thing in here that could go stale. `ROOM_SLACK_PX` is what absorbs
 * that: it sits mid-way between the 8px floor the probe needs and the ~100px
 * ceiling at which one more occupant would fit instead, so both constants can

 *
 * The marked wrapper is the whole apparatus. It is an ordinary full-width block
 * that hands the row its width, until `shrinkWrapHost` reverses that — after the
 * bar has mounted, settled, and evicted down to a fit, which is when the bar's
 * own decisions start feeding back into the width that produced them.
 *
 * What that then proves is the SCHEDULE of the premise check, not the check
 * itself. The bar verifies "my width is given to me, not taken from my content"
 * by hiding the row's occupants and re-reading the row; a bar that asks only at
 * mount has already asked, correctly, and passes this mutation while ratcheting
 * itself empty afterwards. The two outcomes are told apart by geometry alone,
 * which is all the gate can see (the measurer page is a production build, so the
 * fault's dev throw is compiled out, and it registers no report collector):
 *
 * - **asked again** — the probe catches the reversal, the bar stops believing
 *   its width and degrades to the CEILING: every occupant back in the row at its
 *   widest, CSS clipping. The row is now content-wide, the four chips together
 *   are wider than the container at every swept width, and `noClip` fails.
 * - **asked once** — the bar goes on trusting a width that is now its own last
 *   eviction's output, and the ratchet has already run: the row stays at the one
 *   chip it had narrowed to, three chips stranded behind the `⋯`, with most of
 *   the container's own room unused beside it and no width that can give them
 *   back. Nothing sticks out of anything, so `noClip` passes and the gate

    // existed in the jsdom suite, modelled through the primitive's measurement
    // seam, and no browser had ever produced the ratchet it exists to catch.

    // Unmutated it is an ordinary bar and asserts what its siblings assert; the
    // falsification is the fixture's reason to exist. See
    // {@link HostStopsGivingRoomFixture} for what the mutation does and how the
    // two outcomes are told apart by geometry.
    //
    // The widths run WIDE → NARROW, and the order is load-bearing twice over.
    // One mounted bar serves the whole run — the harness re-renders the same
    // component per width, so the instance, its refs and the mutation's inline
    // style all survive from one width to the next — and the mutated pass
    // restarts at `widths[0]` carrying the state the healthy pass left behind.
    //
    // **It is what makes the un-degraded outcome fit.** The mutation is applied
    // synchronously right after the render commits, before the resize observer
    // has re-fitted the row for the new width, so `max-content` freezes the row
    // holding the PREVIOUS width's occupants. Restarting narrower would freeze a
    // wide row inside a narrow container and violate `noClip` on the spot —
    // with or without the guard, which is a falsification that proves nothing.
    // Restarting at the widest inherits the narrowest row instead: comfortably
    // inside the container, so the degraded ceiling is the only thing left that
    // can spill it.
    //
    // **And it is what leaves the premise stale in the direction the guard
    // watches.** The re-probe follows the row NARROWING past the width the
    // premise last held at; narrow → wide would leave that mark at the first
    // width and the frozen row would be wider than it, which the guard is
    // documented not to re-ask about. Descending drags the mark down to the
    // narrowest width, and the frozen row lands below it.
    //
    // Two widths rather than the four or five its siblings sweep, because each
    // narrowing spends one of the bar's budgeted probes (`MAX_SLACK_PROBES`)
    // and the mutated pass needs one left. A longer sweep buys nothing here — the fault
    // is latched at the first mutated width — and would spend the budget the
    // proof runs on, reading as `falsification did not bite` while the guard is
    // in fact working.

/**
 * A widget that renders nothing at a rung must not make the bar flip forever.

 * The defect: "this occupant renders nothing" was recorded as a property of the
 * OCCUPANT, from the DOM, at whatever rung it happened to be sitting at. So an
 * occupant that renders content as `full` and nothing as `compact` cycled —
 * placed at rung 0, it rendered, the fit demoted it to rung 1, it rendered
 * nothing, the fit dropped it from the placement ("there is nothing to place"),
 * the web half read the hole as rung 0 ("this item has never been placed"), and
 * round 1 came back. The round budget stopped it with a `no-convergence` fault
 * and a cramped toolbar; nothing made the cycle unspellable.
 *
 * These are control-flow claims, not pixel ones, so jsdom is the right place for
 * them: widths come through the primitive's own measurement seam, and the fit,
 * both ledgers and the reporting all run as they do in a browser.

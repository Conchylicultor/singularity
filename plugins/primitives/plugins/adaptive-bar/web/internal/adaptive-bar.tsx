 * forced recalculation per sibling. (The fit's budget is that minus the root's
 * own padding and border — `readRowMetrics`'s `insetPx` — because the occupants
 * are laid out in the content box and `measureRowOverflow` judges them against
 * that same box. Do not "simplify" the subtraction away: it is the difference
 * between a budget and a budget for room that does not exist, and a consumer
 * `className` carrying padding is all it takes. Pinned in
 * `web/__tests__/row-inset.test.tsx`.) A primitive that took a content-sized container
 * would have to go looking for the width; this one is handed it by the layout
 * engine.
 *
 * Kept as a module const rather than an inline literal: the `no-adhoc-*` rules
 * harvest string literals reached from a `className` — so, exactly like
 * `viewport-overlay`'s `OVERLAY_ROOT`, the primitive that OWNS these mechanics
 * does not have to disable the rule that keeps them out of feature code.
 *
 * `[&>*]:shrink-0` is the other half of that contract, and it is what makes the
 * width ledger's axiom true rather than merely assumed: **this row never takes
 * width from what it holds.** See `core/width-cache.ts`. An ordinary flex item
 * (`flex: 0 1 auto`) is squeezed whenever its row is over-full — which is
 * exactly the state a pass measures in, since it measures the placement React
 * has already committed. Two things then go wrong at once: the ledger stores a
 * placement-dependent number as `exact`, and `measureRowOverflow` goes blind,
 * because flex absorbs the whole deficit and the occupants sum to exactly the
 * content box.
 *
 * Whether an occupant can be squeezed at all is an accident of its content — a
 * container's floor is its own min-content, and under this row's
 * `whitespace-nowrap` a text run's min-content IS its natural width, which is
 * why every occupant shipping today happens to be safe and a widget with
 * reflowable content would not be.
 *
 * Declared on the ROW rather than on each occupant, for three reasons. It
 * covers the `⋯` trigger — a flex item of this row whose width `measureTrigger`
 * CACHES, so a single squeezed reading would under-reserve it forever. It keeps
 * `flex-shrink` meaning one thing: an occupant's container also lives in the
 * panel dock's column, where the same declaration would be about height. And it
 * covers whatever this row holds next without anyone having to remember.

    // floating window (`apps-core/plugins/surface/plugins/floating/…`), a
    // collapsed miller column (`layouts/plugins/miller/web/components/column.tsx`).

    // — `degraded` — latches for the life of the mount, so the surface pays for
    // the mistake until it remounts. The quiet return keeps whatever placement
    // the bar last committed, and the bar decides again from a real width the
    // moment it is shown.
    //
    // `isRendered` costs nothing: it is asked only on the path that already read
    // zero AND has evictions, after `measure(root)` flushed layout — so it
    // forces no reflow of its own.
    //
    // And a row that DOES generate a box, and still measures nothing with
    // occupants parked outside it, is two different things that this number
    // cannot tell apart:
    //
    // - the ratchet at its end. The host shrink-wraps to the bar, so every
    //   eviction shrank the width that decided the next one, and the row has
    //   emptied itself. A real fault, and the ceiling is the right remedy.
    // - a merely OVER-FULL row. `flex-1` is `flex: 1 1 0%`: when the row's other
    //   items over-fill their container, free space is negative, and a cell
    //   whose base size is 0 has no basis to absorb a share of it — so it
    //   resolves to exactly 0px while fully laid out. Nothing is wrong with the
    //   host and nothing is wrong with the bar. There is no room at this width,
    //   and there will be again when the row widens. Latching here would take
    //   the relocation behaviour away for the life of the mount over a row that
    //   is merely cramped.
    //
    // So do not decide it from a number that carries no answer — restore the
    // conditions under which the guard that CAN answer will run, and let it. The
    // recovery re-admits everything, clears the premise watermark and refunds a
    // probe, which splits the two cases on the very next pass: a shrink-wrapping
    // host now measures its own content, so the probe below runs and faults in
    // the words that name the defect; an over-full row measures nothing again
    // but has nothing evicted any more, so this branch declines it and the pass

 * Does this bar's width follow its own content?

 * has (`withContent`), hide everything the row is currently holding, read the
 * row again, put it back: a bar that was GIVEN its width measures the same
 * either way, and a bar sitting in a box that shrink-wraps to it measures its
 * own content twice.
 *
 * Every cheaper proxy misses the shape that actually ships. `flex-grow: 0` is
 * false here — the bar sets `flex-1` on itself, so the failing case reads as
 * healthy — and `measureRowOverflow` cannot fire either, because a bar whose box
 * grew to fit its own content is not overflowing that box. Both proxies describe
 * the bar's own declaration; only this one describes what the engine did with it.
 *
 * One forced reflow per ask, and invisible to React and to the paint: the
 * mutation is reverted inside the same synchronous block, so the shared
 * `ResizeObserver` compares against sizes that never changed. Same discipline
 * as {@link measureTrigger}, which reveals the hidden trigger to measure it.
 * The caller decides how often to ask — see {@link MAX_SLACK_PROBES}.
 *
 * Goes through the measurement seam rather than `getBoundingClientRect`, so the
 * jsdom suite can model a shrink-wrapping host and drive this exact path —
 * a real fixture, not a mock of the thing under test.

 * every action in the `⋯` panel, which is worse than the fault.

 * This question used to be put to `root.offsetParent`, which is the nearest

 * reintroduce an ancestor comparison in any form; `parentElement` is no better,
 * since the parent may shrink or carry padding of its own.
 *
 * **And not `root.scrollWidth > root.clientWidth` either**, tempting as the

 * paragraphs preventing. It also beats every alternative. `offsetParent` is an
 * ancestor comparison the bar bans elsewhere and is `null` for the
 * `fixed`-positioned solo placement. `isConnected` answers about the document,
 * not about layout. `checkVisibility()` is newer than the WebKit `tauri/` ships
 * and folds in `content-visibility`, whose skipped subtree still has a real
 * width from its host.
 *
 * `visibility: hidden` deliberately still counts as rendered, and so still
 * faults: it changes nothing about layout, so the width the row reads there is

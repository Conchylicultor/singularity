/**
 * The overflow panel — **always mounted, never unmounted, closed only in CSS**.
 *
 * This is the constraint everything else in the file bends to. The panel holds
 * the LIVE DOM of relocated widgets: a Web Audio volume control, a jog wheel
 * mid-fling, a slider whose `aria-valuenow` is the user's actual setting.
 * `Popover` and `DropdownMenu` both unmount their content on close, which would
 * destroy the dock and orphan every container hanging off it — the single
 * instance this primitive exists to preserve would die every time the panel
 * closed. So "closed" is `display: none` + `inert` + `aria-hidden`, and the
 * dock's identity outlives every open/close cycle.
 *
 * `inert` is not decoration either: without it a parked `role="slider"` stays
 * focusable and Tab drops the user into an invisible control.
 *
 * The surface is a plain **dialog** and nothing about it is derived from its
 * occupants. A `role="menu"` was the obvious-looking alternative and is wrong
 * twice over: menu content unmounts on close (above), and inside a menu the
 * roving tabindex and typeahead own the arrow keys a relocated slider needs.
 * Here Tab reaches the widget, arrows reach the slider, Esc closes — and
 * because it is the same instance, the drag physics come along untouched. The
 * honest cost is that the panel has no typeahead and no arrow-key roving.
 *
 * It composes the same three pieces `floating-surface` does — `ViewportOverlay`
 * + `OverlayPanel` + Floating UI — rather than reusing `FloatingSurface`
 * itself, which returns `null` when closed and would therefore reintroduce
 * exactly the unmount this design cannot have.

 * which can change after the bar mounts: a framing variant swaps, a wrapper's
 * class flips, contributions arrive in a later plugin wave, or a shrink-to-
 * content ancestor whose width was floored by a wider sibling stops being
 * floored once the bar's own content grows past it. Asking once at mount spends
 * the guard before any of that happens.
 *
 * So it is re-asked when the row NARROWS, which is the ratchet's own direction:
 * an eviction can only ever reduce what the row holds, so a content-following
 * row can only be dragged narrower by the bar's own decisions, and a masked
 * shrink-wrap reveals itself on the first eviction that takes the content below
 * its floor. A widening pane costs nothing.
 *
 * The budget is what keeps that from being one forced reflow per frame of a
 * narrowing drag. Six rather than two or three, because a legitimate width
 * SWEEP spends one on every step: the layout-geometry gate renders one bar
 * across a range of widths, and any surface that steps through several widths
 * in quick succession does the same — a budget tuned for "one or two host
 * changes" is gone before a later onset could ever be observed. Six is the
 * mount verification plus enough re-verifications to survive such a sweep, and
 * still a handful of reflows rather than one per frame of a sustained drag.
 * The trade, stated rather than hidden — after a long drag the bar is back to
 * trusting its last verification, which is exactly today's behaviour and
 * strictly better than it. Soundness is untouched either way: the probe is
 * definitive, so the schedule changes only WHEN a true answer is obtained,

/**
 * How many times one bar may re-admit its occupants to re-ask a zero width,

 * A RENDERED row that measures nothing with occupants parked outside it can mean
 * two different things, and the width alone cannot tell them apart. Either the
 * ratchet has reached its end — the host shrink-wraps to the bar, so every
 * eviction shrank the width that decided the next one, and the row has emptied
 * itself — or the row is merely OVER-FULL: `flex-1` is `flex: 1 1 0%`, so when
 * the row's other items over-fill their container, free space is negative and
 * the bar's cell resolves to exactly 0px while fully laid out. Nothing is wrong
 * with the host there; the bar simply has no room at this width.
 *
 * The differential probe ({@link MAX_SLACK_PROBES}) is the guard that CAN tell
 * them apart, and it is correctly silent in the second case — hiding the
 * occupants cannot change a width that comes from negative free space. But it
 * needs occupants in the row to hide, which is exactly what the first case has
 * run out of. So the bar re-admits everything and re-asks, instead of guessing
 * from a number that carries no answer.
 *
 * **This is not what makes the recovery terminate**, and believing it is would
 * be the way to break it. A recovery's follow-up pass runs at a real width and
 * commits a different placement, so it costs one `episode.total` like any other
 * — which means {@link HARD_ROUND_CEILING} already bounds a recovery loop, and
 * already ends it with a `no-convergence` surrender. What this number decides is
 * the **diagnosis**: whether a bar that cannot get an answer says `no-slack`
 * (true — the width reading is the problem) or `no-convergence` (a
 * misdiagnosis, blaming the fit for a host's arithmetic).
 *
 * So it is cleared at exactly the instant `episode.total` is — a pass that
 * converges without faulting — rather than on any looser signal. Tying the two
 * together means this introduces no new termination claim: it inherits one that
 * is already proven and already tested (`web/__tests__/termination.test.tsx`).
 * A monotonic per-mount cap was the obvious alternative and is wrong: a single
 * drag oscillating around the collapse point burns one per crossing, so it
 * reinstates the permanent latch, conditioned on gesture history.
 *
 * Three, and the ceiling is React's margin rather than a UX budget. Each
 * recovery costs about two nested synchronous updates on top of an episode
 * already allowed to run to {@link HARD_ROUND_CEILING}, which is itself chosen
 * to stay well under React's nested-update limit of 50. One recovery is all a
 * healthy answer needs; the other two are the spare for an occupant that mounts

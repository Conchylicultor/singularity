/**
 * The yielding cell's floor, in multiples of its own font size: the width below
 * which it stops giving and the row is judged to have overflowed.
 *
 * **Why there is a floor at all.** Without one this cell gives until it is
 * nothing, and it gives FIRST — the occupants are rigid, so flex takes the whole
 * deficit out of the one child that can shrink. The row therefore never
 * overflows, the fit is never asked to demote or relocate anybody, and the pane
 * title is the first and total casualty of a busy header: "Une Sorcière Comme
 * Les Autres" renders as "Une" at 1400px and disappears entirely at 900px while
 * every display option stays inline. A cell that can always give is a cell that
 * pays for everyone.
 *
 * **The unit is the cell's own font size, not pixels.** The floor is about
 * LEGIBILITY — how many characters survive — and characters scale with the
 * active typography and density presets, which change at runtime. A px constant
 * would mean sixteen characters under one preset and ten under another: the same
 * mistake as the `MORE_BTN_W = 32` this primitive replaced, in a different
 * costume, and the same reason `readRowMetrics` reads the row's gap off the
 * rendered element rather than re-deriving it from the `gap` prop.
 *
 * `ch` — the width of the "0" glyph — is the more literal unit for "how many
 * characters", but reading one costs a measured glyph: an element to insert, a
 * reflow to read it, per pass. `em` is in the computed style already, scales
 * with the ambient font identically, and differs from `ch` by a constant factor
 * that this number is chosen in anyway.
 *
 * **8em** is ~112px at the pane header's 14px, and a proportional UI sans
 * averages about half an em per glyph — so roughly 16 characters, which is where
 * a truncated title still tells two panes apart ("Une Sorcière Com…",
 * "conversation-det…"). Below that it is a stub, and a stub is not worth the
 * room the actions gave up for it.
 *
 * One number in the primitive rather than a prop at every call site: what makes
 * a title legible is a property of text, not of the surface hosting it, and a
 * knob here would be a knob every consumer has to have an opinion about.

 *

/**
 * The bar's one **yielding** child: the row's give.
 *
 * Everything else in a bar is an occupant — measured, laddered, demoted, and
 * relocated when the row runs out of room — and rigid, because the width ledger
 * rests on an occupant's width being its own. This is the opposite of all of
 * that, and it is the pane title's shape:
 *
 * - **Excluded from the fit ledger.** It never registers, and the bar's math
 *   reads registered containers' rects, so it is invisible to the fit by
 *   construction rather than by a flag the fit has to remember to skip. It is
 *   never measured, never demoted, never relocated.
 * - **{@link yieldClass} rather than rigid.** `min-w-0` lets it fall below its
 *   own content width, so it absorbs whatever the occupants leave and the
 *   `<Text>` inside it ellipsizes — instead of pushing the actions out of the
 *   row, which is what a rigid title does.
 * - **Down to a floor, and no further.** It reserves {@link YIELD_FLOOR_EM} of
 *   its own font size out of the fit's budget, so pressure past that width is
 *   the row overflowing and the bar relocates an occupant instead of taking the
 *   last of the title. Without it this cell gives first and gives everything,
 *   the row never overflows, and nothing else is ever asked to move.
 *
 * It takes no slack by default (`flex-grow` stays 0): a yielding child sits
 * against its neighbours, and the row's slack is the bar's to hand out. Pass
 * {@link AdaptiveBarYieldProps.grow} when this cell should hold that slack
 * itself, which is what a LEADING title in an `align="end"` row needs. The
 * other child that grows is the
 * reorder `spacer` node — the other half of `Fill`
 * ([`grow`](../../../css/plugins/grow/CLAUDE.md) to this one's
 * [`yield`](../../../css/plugins/yield/CLAUDE.md)) — which needs nothing from
 * this primitive: `flex: 1 1 0%` with no content contributes no width to the
 * row, so the fit's sum-of-occupants is untouched either way.
 *
 * **At most one per bar, enforced loudly.** See `BarRegistry.claimYield`: two
 * of them would split the leftover between themselves, both ellipsize, and
 * which one loses would be decided by their content rather than by the author.
 *
 * Outside a bar it is still an ordinary yielding cell — a primitive that only
 * works in one place is a primitive nobody composes, the same reason
 * `AdaptiveBar.Item` is transparent there.

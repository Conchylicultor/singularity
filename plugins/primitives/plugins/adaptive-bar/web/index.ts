    "Overflow as relocation, not transformation: a bar that asks each widget for a smaller form of itself and moves the rest — as themselves, ONE live instance each, never rendered twice — into an always-mounted panel. Each occupant owns one stable portal container the bar re-parents imperatively, so a relocated slider is still the same slider mid-drag; measurement reads the real nodes, and every policy (which forms exist, how eagerly to yield) comes from the widget through action-presentation rather than from the host.",

/**
 * no-raw-actions-slot
 *
 * A component that takes an `actions` / `rowActions` / `itemActions` prop and
 * renders it in JSX must render it THROUGH `RowActions`
 * (`@plugins/primitives/plugins/row-actions/web`) — the one implementation of a
 * hover-revealed trailing action cluster. Rendering the binding anywhere else
 * (bare in JSX, or inside a `<Clip>` / `<Stack>` / `<Pin>` / `<span>` wrapper)
 * is a second implementation of the cluster, and second implementations diverge:
 * different reveal, different popup-hold, different pointerdown guard, different
 * size — all invisible until a user notices one view behaving unlike another.
 *
 * ## Why this is a DATAFLOW rule and not a class-shape rule
 *
 * Do not "simplify" this into a className scan. Its predecessor,
 * `no-uncoupled-hover-reveal`, asks whether a class string couples `opacity` and
 * `pointer-events`. That question is about the mechanism a duplicate happens to
 * use TODAY, so a duplicate answers it **in place**: the tree's `w-0` action
 * cluster (`<Clip className={open ? "w-auto" : "w-0"}>{actions}</Clip>`) added
 * the coupling, passed, and survived hardened — while still changing layout on
 * reveal, which moved the anchor of any menu opened inside it (`ee2dfe424`, and
 * `research/2026-08-06-global-row-action-anchor-stability.md`). The next
 * duplicate will use tomorrow's mechanism and pass just as easily.
 *
 * The question this rule asks instead — *does the binding reach the primitive?*
 * — is not satisfiable by editing the duplicate. No class edit, no
 * `pointer-events` addition, no rewrite of the wrapper makes
 * `<Clip>{actions}</Clip>` pass. The only way to satisfy it is to render through
 * `RowActions`, which IS deletion of the duplicate. That is the whole point, and
 * it is why the rule ships with **no path allowlist**: an allowlist is exactly
 * the escape hatch that let the previous duplicate live.
 *
 * ## What counts as reaching the primitive
 *
 *   <RowActions pin={null}>{actions}</RowActions>   // ✓ rendered inside it
 *   <Row actions={actions} />                       // ✓ forwarded on to a host
 *   actions={<Sized>{actions}</Sized>}              // ✓ forwarded, wrapped
 *   const trailing = <>{actions}{more}</>           // ✓ composed, not placed
 *   <Clip className={w0}>{actions}</Clip>           // ✗ a placed cluster
 *   <div>{actions}</div>                            // ✗ a placed cluster
 *   <div>{rowActions(row, i)}</div>                 // ✗ ditto, render-prop form
 *
 * The line is PLACEMENT: an element wrapping the render chooses the cluster's
 * box, geometry and reveal, and that is the duplicate. Forwarding and fragment
 * composition choose nothing — the site that finally places the cluster is where
 * the rule bites, and it only ever bites once. `SectionCard`, `SectionHeaderRow`
 * and `detail-sections` pass this way today, having no cluster of their own.
 *
 * ## Bail-outs (deliberate false negatives)
 *
 * Contributed rules run as `error`, so a false positive breaks the build. This
 * matcher therefore favours missing a case over flagging valid code:
 *
 * 1. **Name-based, no type resolution.** Only the three prop names above. A slot
 *    called `trailing` escapes. Accepted: row containers are few, all in
 *    `primitives/`, and adding one is a reviewed act.
 * 2. **Only destructured props.** The binding must come from an `ObjectPattern`
 *    in the enclosing function's PARAMETER list, or from a
 *    `const { actions } = props` whose `props` is a plain parameter of that same
 *    function. A `props.actions` / `node.actions` member render is NOT tracked —
 *    that shape is dominated by actions carried inside data objects (graph nodes,
 *    descriptors), which are not row clusters.
 * 3. **Only child positions.** The identifier must reach the rendered output of a
 *    `JSXExpressionContainer` whose parent is a JSX element or fragment. A
 *    condition (`actions && …`), a call (`actions.setSort()`) or an attribute
 *    value never fires.
 * 4. **Any `<RowActions>` ancestor acquits**, at any depth, even across a nested
 *    callback. Wrapping inside the primitive is fine — the primitive still owns
 *    the reveal on its own outermost node.
 * 5. **Composition is not placement** (see `placesCluster`). A render with no
 *    element ancestor at all, or one under an `actions=`-shaped attribute, is
 *    forwarding or fragment composition, not a cluster. The one hole this leaves:
 *    a fragment stashed in a variable and THEN wrapped
 *    (`const c = <>{actions}</>; <Clip>{c}</Clip>`) — the second site renders `c`,
 *    not an `actions` prop, so it escapes. Closing it needs alias dataflow;
 *    accepted, in the same class as `import { RowActions as X }`.
 * 6. **The primitive is matched by NAME.** `import { RowActions as X }` evades,
 *    and a local component named `RowActions` (the jsonl-viewer one) acquits its
 *    own hosts. Both are accepted: the local one is itself a thin wrapper around
 *    the primitive, and re-aliasing to dodge a lint rule is not accidental code.
 * 7. **Only top-level statements** of a function body are scanned for the
 *    `const { actions } = props` form.
 *
 * A genuinely non-row `actions` slot (a toolbar's, a banner's) escapes by NAME —
 * call it `trailing` — or, if the name is load-bearing, by a per-site
 * `// eslint-disable-next-line row-actions/no-raw-actions-slot -- <reason>`, a
 * marker that travels with the code and is re-reviewed when the code moves. What
 * it must never get is a path entry in the barrel's `ignores`.

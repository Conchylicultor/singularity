/**
 * Apply to the row element whose **hover** should reveal its {@link RowActions}.
 * Establishes the `row-actions` hover group the cluster reacts to — the primitive
 * brings its **own** group rather than piggybacking on whatever group the row
 * already carries (e.g. the sidebar's `group/menu-item`), so it stays
 * group-name-agnostic. Hover is all this group carries: focus is scoped to the
 * cluster's own subtree instead (see `revealClasses`), so a click landing on
 * something inside the row cannot pin its actions. `relative` is included so a
 * pinned cluster anchors to this row; harmless on rows that are already
 * positioned.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <SidebarMenuItem className={rowActionsAnchor}>
 *   <SidebarMenuButton>…</SidebarMenuButton>
 *   <RowActions>
 *     <IconButton icon={MdClose} label="Close" onClick={…} />
 *   </RowActions>

/**
 * Coupled opacity↔pointer-events reveal, keyed on the primitive's own
 * `group/row-actions`. Hidden is always BOTH `opacity-0` AND
 * `pointer-events-none`, so the invisible cluster never intercepts clicks on the
 * row beneath it. `select-none` is unconditional: action buttons are chrome, never
 * selectable content, so the cluster stays out of any text-selection range (Ctrl+A
 * or drag) over the row. Revealed on row hover, on keyboard focus INSIDE the
 * cluster, and — via `PopupOpenScope` below — while a popup launched from inside
 * the cluster is open, so an open menu never hangs off an invisible trigger.
 * Group names must be literal for Tailwind's JIT, so this lives as a static
 * string rather than an interpolated group.
 *
 * The focus half is `has-[:focus-visible]`, and both parts of that are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * - **`has-[…]`, not `group-…/row-actions`**, asks the focus question about the
 *   CLUSTER rather than the row. `:has()` matches descendants only, and these
 *   classes ride the outermost node the primitive renders (the `Pin`, or the
 *   `Stack`/`Surface` when `pin={null}`), which contains exactly the action
 *   buttons — so nothing in the row body can satisfy it. Keying on the row is
 *   what pinned the cluster after an ordinary click: clicking a row puts focus
 *   somewhere inside it on every surface (a collapsible card's toggle, a
 *   `tabIndex={-1}` select-scope div, an inline file link, a tree chevron, the
 *   row's own primary button), so the actions stayed on screen after the pointer
 *   left.
 * - **`:focus-visible`, not `:focus`**, keeps the reveal keyboard-only. Chromium
 *   does not mark a mouse-clicked button as focus-visible, so clicking an action
 *   no longer pins its own cluster either; a Tab keypress always sets it, so
 *   keyboard reach is preserved. This is already the app's spelling for keyboard
 *   reach — see `tree/web/internal/tree-row-chrome.tsx:102`, the three
 *   `ui/tree-disclosure` variants, and workflows' sidebar label action.

 * graph, which is what lets `css/row` — a layout primitive — compose it. An
 * alias for "the button that goes in here" would drag `icon-button` (and
 * through it `action-presentation`) into every consumer of `Row`.
 *
 * The reveal is **opacity only** — the cluster is pinned, so it occupies no flow
 * width and its geometry is identical hovered or not. That is load-bearing, not
 * an optimization: a menu launched from inside the cluster anchors to it, so a
 * reveal that changed layout would slide the open menu sideways the moment the
 * pointer left the row.

/**
 * Verifies the reveal rule this primitive owns: a row's action cluster appears
 * while the pointer is over the row, and while KEYBOARD focus is on a button
 * inside the cluster — never because a click left focus somewhere in the row.
 *
 * Nothing but a browser can answer this. `:focus-visible` is a live UA decision
 * about how the last interaction happened, not a class the DOM carries: the same
 * button, focused by a mouse click and by a Tab keypress, differs only in a state
 * Chromium computes. A jsdom test can assert the class string; only a real
 * browser can say whether it matched.

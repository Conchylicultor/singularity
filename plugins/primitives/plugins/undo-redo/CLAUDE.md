# undo-redo

Surface-scoped, domain-agnostic client-side undo/redo command-history stack —
the **command-pattern** tier (record minimal forward/reverse thunks; undo applies
the reverse onto the *current* state), not snapshots. One independent history per
surface tab, backed by `scoped-store`.

The provider is mounted **once per tab**, by `apps-core/tab-surface` — not by any
app or editor. The history is a platform capability: a sidebar row's delete and an
edit in the page body land on ONE chronological stack, and the `mod+z` bindings are
registered exactly once per surface (two same-id registrations would race in the
page-global `ShortcutManager`). Consumers only `record`.

```tsx
import {
  usePendingFlush,
  useScopedUndoRedo,
  useUndoRedo,
} from "@plugins/primitives/plugins/undo-redo/web";

// Recording a reversible command into the tab's history:
const { record, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo, clear } = useUndoRedo();
record({
  label: "Move block",
  undo: () => applyPatch(reverse),
  redo: () => applyPatch(forward),
  coalesceKey: "drag:block-7", // optional: merge rapid same-key edits
});

// Same api, but every entry dies with this mount (see "Entry lifetime" below):
const scoped = useScopedUndoRedo();

// A producer holding an entry it has not recorded yet (a typing run still
// inside its idle window) seals it before any undo/redo pops (see "Pending
// flush" below). Registered for this mount's lifetime:
usePendingFlush(closeAllOpenTextRuns);
```

## Behavior

- **Command pattern.** Each `HistoryEntry` carries an `undo` and a `redo` thunk
  (sync or async). `undo()` pops `past`, runs `undo()`, pushes onto `future`;
  `redo()` is symmetric. Entanglement-safe: a thunk only touches what its action
  touched, so undoing an old action never clobbers later unrelated edits.
- **Coalescing.** When a new record shares the top entry's `coalesceKey` and
  arrives within `coalesceWindowMs` (default 500ms), the two merge into one —
  **keep the first entry's `undo`, take the latest entry's `redo` + label**. Used
  for run-together edits (typing, dragging) that should undo as a unit.
- **Re-entrancy guard.** For exactly the **synchronous span** of an
  `undo`/`redo` thunk's call — raised before the call, lowered the moment it
  returns, never held across an async thunk's `await` — the store's `replaying`
  flag is raised, so a reverse/forward patch the thunk dispatches synchronously
  and that flows straight back through the same `record` path (a re-entrant
  echo) is **ignored** rather than recorded as a brand-new command. That echo is
  the ONLY thing the guard is for. A `record` that arrives while an async thunk
  is awaiting its round trip is a real entry from another producer (the page
  editor's idle timer closing a typing run while a stored-doc replay is in
  flight) and **lands** as the top entry; the page editor's thunks never record
  synchronously. See "Pending flush" for what else runs outside the guard.
- **Serialized turns.** `undo()`/`redo()` are **turns** on one FIFO queue per
  provider. When nothing is in flight a turn runs synchronously (flush, pop, and
  the thunk's start all happen before the call returns). A call while a thunk is
  in flight **queues behind it** instead of running concurrently: two rapid
  undos replay strictly LIFO, and a flush registered during the flight runs at
  the start of the queued turn. A queued turn that finds nothing to pop is a
  no-op. A failed turn never wedges the queue: hand-over is in `finally`.
- **Fresh records clear `future`** and the `past` stack is capped to `maxDepth`
  (default 200) by dropping the oldest entries.
- **`canUndo` / `canRedo` are reactive** (selector reads) — components re-render
  when they flip. They describe the **recorded** stack as it stands: neither an
  entry a pending flush would still seal nor a turn still waiting in the queue
  counts. `record` / `undo` / `redo` / `clear` / `registerPendingFlush` are
  stable callbacks.
- **Loud failures.** A rejected `undo`/`redo` thunk surfaces as an
  `UndoRedoThunkError` whose message names the cause (`cause` stays attached).
  The turn runs fire-and-forget, so a rejection becomes an unhandled rejection —
  the crash collector files it — never silently swallowed.

## Pending flush (`usePendingFlush` / `registerPendingFlush`)

A producer that coalesces many small edits into ONE entry (the page editor's
typing runs: the entry is recorded when the run goes idle) has, between the first
keystroke and that deadline, an entry that **exists but is not on the stack**. A
⌘Z in that window would pop the entry below it — the previous action — while the
half-typed run stayed put.

The seam: every registered flush runs **synchronously at the start of each
turn, before the pop, outside any thunk call**, so its `record` lands as the
top entry and the stack the user acts on is complete. Flushes are idempotent by
contract (nothing open ⇒ record nothing) and run for `redo` too — a flush that
seals anything clears `future`, so that redo is rightly a no-op.

- `usePendingFlush(fn)` — the mount-bound form: registered on mount,
  unregistered on unmount, reads the latest `fn` through a ref (a new identity
  per render neither re-registers nor moves it in the run order). Use this.
- `registerPendingFlush(fn): () => void` on the api — the imperative form for a
  producer that is not a component. Returns the unregister.

The registry is one `Set` per provider mount (per tab), in registration order.
Serialization (above) is what makes the flush the entry POPPED rather than one
recorded beside a replay: the flush runs at the start of the queued turn, so
what it seals is on top when that turn pops.

## Entry lifetime (scopes)

The stack outlives every pane and editor in the tab, so an entry must be honest
about what it needs to replay:

> **An entry whose thunks depend on a live mount MUST declare a `scope`; a
> scope's entries are dropped from `past` AND `future` when that mount unmounts.
> Entries whose thunks are self-contained (pure server calls) stay unscoped and
> live for the tab.**

`useScopedUndoRedo()` is the whole mechanism: same `UndoRedoApi`, but `record`
stamps a `useId()`-derived scope onto every entry and the unmount cleanup calls
`dropScope(scope)`. Use it whenever the thunks close over a per-mount store, doc,
or editor (the page editor's entries are data, but their patch thunks close over
the page's optimistic store, which dies with its mount — replaying one after
would be a patch dispatched into the wrong page's overlay at worst). Use plain
`useUndoRedo()` when
`undo`/`redo` are just server calls valid anywhere in the tab (a trash restore),
so the entry rightly survives navigating away.

`dropScope` is a pure filter over both stacks (`internal/stack.ts`), so a scope's
removal never disturbs surrounding entries.

## Shortcuts

`useUndoRedoShortcuts({ when? })` registers three surface-scoped bindings via
`useSurfaceShortcuts`: `mod+z` (undo), `mod+shift+z` and `mod+y` (redo). All have
`enableInInputs: true` so they fire inside editable surfaces; undo is gated on
`(canUndo || a pending flush is registered) && when?.(event)`, redo on
`canRedo && when?.(event)`. The flush half of the undo gate is what lets the very
first typing run on a fresh page be undone: the stack cannot see an entry a
producer is still holding, so with a flush registered the key must reach
`undo()` — which seals it first — even while the recorded stack is empty.
**`tab-surface` already calls it once per tab — a consumer never calls it
again**, or two same-id registrations race in the page-global `ShortcutManager`.
A tab whose app records nothing and registers no flush keeps an empty stack, so
the `when` guard rejects and the keys are never claimed.

### This stack is not the only undo history on screen (`resolveUndoOwner`)

> `mod+z` belongs to the innermost history declaring itself over the keystroke's
> target.

A tab also holds histories the stack doesn't own — every native
`<input>`/`<textarea>`, and every Lexical editor mounting `HistoryPlugin` (the
`text-editor` primitive: agent prompt, task description, draft form). All answer
to the same key. `resolveUndoOwner(event.target)` (`internal/undo-owner.ts`) is
the built-in first half of every binding's `when`, reading the nearest
ancestor-or-self `data-undo-owner`:

- `surfaceUndoProps` — a region whose edits are recorded on THIS stack, so a
  caret inside it must not withhold the key. The page block list is the case:
  no per-block Lexical history, so what the user types is recorded onto this
  stack instead — block text through `recordTextEdit`, a block's own plain-text
  field through `useBlockPlainText` / `<BlockTextArea>`.
- `localUndoProps` — a field whose ⌘Z must stay INSIDE it: a nested editor with
  a history of its own, or a transient field the browser's own undo stack should
  own. **A chrome field inside a `surfaceUndoProps` region has to spread it** —
  an empty bookmark block's URL prompt, a place search box, the URL input in the
  link popover. They hold nothing the page persists, so the browser is the right
  owner, and without the marker the region around them takes the key instead.
  `page-editor/no-unhistoried-block-field` is the rung that enforces it: a raw
  `<textarea>` / `<input>` / `contenteditable` under `plugins/page/**/web` is an
  error unless it renders `<BlockTextArea>` or spreads the marker.

**Undeclared resolves off the target**: a text-editing host is `local`, anything
else `surface`. That test is narrower than `shortcuts`' `isEditableTarget` on
purpose (which counts checkboxes and file pickers): no text history to protect,
and ⌘Z right after ticking a checkbox must still reach the stack.

**But the fallback only applies when NO ancestor declares** — resolution is by
nearest declaring ancestor, so the two cases read opposite ways, and the second
is where the marker stops being optional:

- **No declaring ancestor.** The undeclared field already resolves to `local`,
  so the marker changes nothing.
- **Inside a `surfaceUndoProps` region.** The region wins. An undeclared field
  there sends ⌘Z to the SURFACE stack: the binding calls `preventDefault()`, the
  browser's own history for that field never runs, and the last unrelated
  document edit is reversed while the user is typing. Every field rendered in
  the page body is in this case.

This section used to say the marker "fails safe — a missing one costs a
keystroke that stays in the field being typed in, never a document rewound
behind the user's back". That is true only in the first case, and false in the
second. Two authors read it and shipped the same bug: a page block rendering its
own `<textarea>` (the code block, then `math/equation`), where a paste could not
be undone and ⌘Z rewound the document instead.

A portal is not a substitute for declaring it either. A field a popover lifts to
`document.body` reads as `local` only because `closest()` no longer sees the
region, and `PortalForwardProvider` exists precisely to re-stamp
ancestry-derived `data-*` attributes across portals — so that reading is one
commit from flipping.

Two consequences that look like bugs and are not: focus on `<body>` (where a
structural undo leaves it) is `surface`, so undo chains; and ⌘Z in a page TITLE
undoes the title text only — an ordinary autosaved input, never on this stack.

## Invariants

- Pure stack/coalescing logic lives in `web/internal/stack.ts` (React-free,
  unit-tested in `stack.test.ts`); the store only wires it to `scoped-store` and
  runs the turns (`web/internal/use-undo-redo.ts`, exercised in
  `web/__tests__/pending-flush.test.tsx`). `Date.now()` is read only inside
  `record` (never during render).
- The replay guard is raised by the turn runner around the thunk's
  SYNCHRONOUS call and nowhere else — never across an `await` — so the only
  `record` it ever drops is a thunk's own synchronous echo. A flush can never
  observe it raised, and neither can a producer recording during an async
  thunk's round trip. A producer holding a not-yet-recorded entry still goes
  through a pending flush — not because a direct `record` would be dropped,
  but because it must be sealed BEFORE the pop so it is the entry popped.
- No contributions — a pure library primitive. Renders no visible UI.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Surface-scoped client-side undo/redo command-history stack: a UndoRedoProvider per surface tab holding past/future stacks of {undo,redo} thunks, with time-windowed coalescing, a max-depth cap, a re-entrancy guard so replayed patches aren't re-recorded, mount-scoped entries (useScopedUndoRedo drops its entries when its mount unmounts), a pending-flush seam (usePendingFlush / registerPendingFlush: a producer holding a not-yet-recorded entry seals it at the start of every undo/redo turn, outside the replay guard, so it is the entry popped), serialized turns (an undo/redo during an in-flight thunk queues FIFO behind it instead of running under the guard), and an optional useUndoRedoShortcuts (mod+z / mod+shift+z / mod+y) convenience binding.

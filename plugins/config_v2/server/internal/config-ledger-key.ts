/**
 * How a config document is named in the shared agent-write ledger
 * (`@plugins/infra/plugins/request-origin/plugins/agent-write-ledger/server`).
 *
 * The ledger keys an entry by one opaque string and prints it to the e2e
 * harness as `Config documents: <key>`, so the key is the readable
 * `<storePath>` for the base scope and `<storePath> @<scopeId>` for a scoped
 * document — the spelling the harness used before the ledger was shared. The
 * restore reads (storePath, scopeId) back out of it, so the encoding must be
 * injective: {@link configLedgerKey} refuses the one input that would make it
 * ambiguous, rather than trusting that no store path ever contains the mark.
 */

/**
 * The three files a config document is made of. All three are captured, always.
 *
 * Capturing only the override would be wrong for half the write paths:
 * `forkDescriptorScope` writes the scoped `<name>.origin.jsonc` AND
 * `<name>.jsonc`; `removeDescriptorScope` unlinks both; `deleteOverrideByPath`
 * unlinks override + ancestor; the conflict resolvers rewrite the override and
 * unlink the ancestor. Capturing the trio uniformly is correct for every
 * existing path and every future one, with no per-operation knowledge — which
 * is the only version that stays correct when someone adds a sixth write path.

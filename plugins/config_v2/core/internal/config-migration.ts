/**
 * A one-time rewrite of a config's SAVED values, for when the shape its fields
 * store changed (a renamed key, a value re-spelled). The user layer
 * (`~/.singularity/state/config/<ns>/`) is not in git, so a commit can only
 * change it through code the build runs: each `./singularity build` applies
 * every migration its namespace has not applied yet — to that config's origin,
 * override and ancestor documents, base and app scopes — right before
 * propagating the git config there, and records it (the shared config ledger,
 * `config_v2/plugins/ledger`; hash chains are kept so overrides stay in
 * force). The committed `config/` files are rewritten in the same diff as the
 * code, by hand.
 *
 * `apply` receives one whole document and returns it rewritten (return it
 * unchanged when there is nothing to do). It must be idempotent: a document
 * already in the new shape is handed to it too.

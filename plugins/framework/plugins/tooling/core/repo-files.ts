// runner's fallback (`--no-cache`, or a snapshot that failed to load), and
// `listRepoFiles`.
//
// The set comes from git, never from a filesystem walk. Everything in the check
// system that reasons about files derives them from git: the cache key
// (`computeTreeHash` — scratch index + `git add -A` + `write-tree`) and the
// read-set snapshot (one `git ls-tree -r` over that tree). A walk with its own
// deny-list answers a different question — it sees gitignored files the key
// does not cover — and so records a verdict that is not a function of its own
// key. That is what made a stray `.ts` under `.cache/scratch/` fail
// type-check's coverage gate (2026-09-09); see
// research/2026-09-09-tooling-check-file-enumeration-from-git.md.
//
// Membership (`all`, `has`, `under`) is answered in memory, and content through
// async reads one gate per set bounds — so a caller iterating thousands of
// files never makes a blocking call per file on a thread others share.

/**
 * One-shot migration: move each reorderable slot's config files from the
 * hand-authored slot id they were named by to the derived declaration key.
 *
 *   config/<plugin path>/studio.sidebar.jsonc  ->  config/<plugin path>/sidebar.jsonc
 *
 * The git layer was migrated in the same commit that dropped the `id` parameter
 * from the slot constructors. THIS script remains for the USER layer
 * (`~/.singularity/config/<worktree>/…`), which no commit can carry — run it
 * once, by hand, at land time:
 *
 *   bun <this file>            # dry run over every worktree's user config
 *   bun <this file> --apply
 *
 * It reads the rename table as COMMITTED DATA rather than deriving it. The old
 * ids exist nowhere in the source any more — deriving them would mean reading a
 * manifest that has since been regenerated — so the table is the only durable
 * record of the mapping. Delete both once every worktree has been migrated.

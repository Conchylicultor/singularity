/**
 * Load the web runtime the way the browser loads it, and run one declaration
 * pass over it — the build-time twin of what `PluginProvider` does on each
 * render pass, through the very same `declarePluginSlots`, so the two cannot
 * disagree about who owns a slot (or throw differently on a slot two plugins
 * claim).
 *
 * `scope` picks WHICH plugin set is modelled, and the two are not
 * interchangeable — a caller states the question it is asking:
 *
 * `"registry"` — THE REGISTRY, NOT THE FILESYSTEM. A DISABLED plugin is omitted
 * from `web.generated.ts`, so the browser never loads it, never creates its
 * slots and never registers a config descriptor for them. This pass therefore
 * skips it too. Getting that wrong is not cosmetic: the server's descriptors
 * come from the reorderable-slots manifest, which is this same set, so declaring
 * a plugin the browser will not load makes the two runtimes register different
 * descriptor sets — `config-v2:registrations-paired` fails, and the extra
 * descriptor would own a config file nothing on the web side can read. Skipping
 * the IMPORT (not merely the declaration) is what keeps that true: an imported
 * barrel whose plugin this pass does not declare would put its slots in the
 * created-set with no owner, which the orphan guard would then read as a slot
 * nobody declares.
 *
 * `"source"` — EVERYTHING THE CHECKOUT DECLARES, disabled plugins included.
 * Here importing those barrels IS the point: a reader describing SOURCE asks
 * what the tree declares, not what the browser loads. `facets:render-complete`
 * checks the surface `review.plugin-changes.diff-renderer`, owned by the
 * disabled `review/plugins/plugin-changes` — under registry scope it would read
 * every facet as missing its diff renderer. The created-set hazard above does
 * not follow here, because this scope DECLARES every barrel it imports: an
 * imported plugin's slots get an owner, so they never enter `created \ declared`
 * ownerless. What the orphan guard sees is a separate matter, settled at
 * {@link assertSlotsDeclared}.
 *
 * The registry pass is also the phase boundary the codegen ordering rests on:
 * after it, every web slot the browser will load exists and every owner is
 * stamped, and NO server barrel has been imported yet. Both the orphan guard and
 * the reorderable-slots manifest read that pass's result.
 *
 * Memoized per (scope, root) — NOT per root. The barrel imports are ESM-cache
 * hits on a second call, but each scope's declaration pass must run exactly once
 * per process, and the two scopes settle different sets: sharing one memo would
 * hand whichever caller arrived second the other's answer, silently.
 *
 * The two scopes therefore run as two independent passes, and the check runner
 * awaits every check under `Promise.all` — so both loops below can be in flight
 * at once. What makes that safe is `importBarrel` itself, which admits one
 * import at a time process-wide: overlapping loops would otherwise read a
 * `default` binding off a module the other loop is still evaluating. The memo
 * per root that preceded this one serialized them by accident; the lane states
 * it, for these two passes and for the five other loops in this process.

/**
 * The created-vs-declared guard: every slot constructed in this process must be
 * declared by exactly one plugin (`PluginDefinition.slots`).
 *
 * WHY HERE. Both sets are complete only where module loading is complete, and
 * this process is the one place that holds: {@link declareSlotsFromBarrels}
 * imports every web barrel. In the browser, web plugins load in TIERS
 * (`web-sdk/core/load-tiers.ts`), so mid-boot `created` and `declared` are both
 * partial and a slot created by an eager module but declared by a deferred
 * plugin would false-positive. The build is the guarantee, not a backstop.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN. `defineSlot` is the single funnel every slot
 * constructor calls, and it appends to the created-set at construction — so this
 * sees every slot that exists, whatever file, factory or nesting depth produced
 * it, with no registry to keep in sync.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS BEFORE THE REST OF CODEGEN. An undeclared slot is a slot missing
 * from the reorderable-slots manifest, and a missing manifest row is a config
 * descriptor that never registers — which `pruneOrphanedConfigFiles` would read
 * as an orphaned config file and DELETE. Failing here, before any config origin
 * is generated, is what keeps a declaration mistake from costing authored files.
 *
 * WHY `"registry"`, AND WHY THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION TO "COMPLETE". The guard is
 * registry-scoped ON PURPOSE: a disabled plugin ships nothing and owes nothing,
 * so its slots are outside what this guard is asking about. Switching it to
 * `"source"` would look like widening the net and would instead import every
 * disabled barrel ahead of the freeze point this phase boundary defines, and
 * demand declarations from plugins that register no descriptors — which is the
 * `config-v2:registrations-paired` divergence the registry scope exists to
 * prevent. Re-enabling a plugin puts its slots back in the created-set and the
 * guard names any it forgot; that is the whole coverage story.

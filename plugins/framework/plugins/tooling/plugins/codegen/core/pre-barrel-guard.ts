 * barrel import of the run. It re-renders every pre-barrel manifest and compares
 * to disk: if any differs, a codegen step ran a barrel import while a pre-barrel
 * manifest was stale — which Bun's frozen ESM cache makes unrecoverable for the
 * rest of the build. We throw immediately with an actionable message rather than
 * let `generateConfigOrigins` silently prune freshly-authored overrides.

/**
 * Single source of truth for the ordered, non-migration **repo-tree** codegen
 * pipeline.
 *
 * The full `./singularity build` and the push-time `regen-generated` normalize
 * step MUST regenerate the identical set of repo-tree artifacts, in the identical
 * order — otherwise push can commit a tree the next full build doesn't reproduce
 * (dirtying main) and push-time in-sync checks miss drift. This module is that
 * shared pipeline so the two paths can never drift again. (Duplicating the call
 * list across build.ts and regen-generated.ts is exactly how the drift was
 * introduced.)
 *
 * Out of scope (NOT repo-tree codegen, handled by their own steps in build):
 *   - DB migrations (`generateMigration`) — stateful, build-only.
 *   - `writeCentralRoutesManifest`, `central.json`, `propagateConfigToUser` —
 *     these write under `~/.singularity/`, not the repo tree.
 *
 * Split into two functions to preserve build's interleaving of DB/central steps:
 * build runs registry codegen early (before central spawns + migrations), then
 * the manifest codegen later (after migrations). `regen-generated` runs both
 * back-to-back. The order WITHIN each function is authoritative — keep the
 * ordering comments here as the record of why.

 *   - plugin docs FIRST: builds the enriched plugin tree the next two steps reuse.
 *   - reorderable-slots & data-views: AFTER plugin docs (reuse the enriched tree),
 *     BEFORE config origins — each registers config_v2 directives (one per slot /
 *     one `views` descriptor per id) that the origins depend on. Importing the
 *     codegen barrel also installs the reorder per-slot contribution catalog as
 *     the default origin-annotations preparer, so origins carry the catalog
 *     comments.
 *   - custom-utilities: BEFORE the `app-css-utilities-in-sync` check consumes it;
 *     no plugin-tree dependency (it only reads app.css by path), so placed among
 *     the CSS-related steps.
 *   - token-group-vars: BEFORE the build-time CSS single-owner checks
 *     (`css-vars-single-owner`, `css-vars-supplied`) consume it; safe here since
 *     it only reads token-group descriptors.
 *   - config-origins: LAST — depends on every config_v2 directive registered above.

/**
 * Generates `ramp.generated.ts` — the spacing ramp's step set and every
 * step-keyed utility family's literal class table — from the `/* @ramp … *\/`
 * declarations in app.css.
 *
 * app.css is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the ramp, because it is where the
 * 112 `@utility` classes actually exist. The ramp used to be re-declared in
 * TypeScript instead: `SpaceStep` in `primitives/css/spacing/web` and `RailStep`
 * in `primitives/css/rail/core` were two independent unions of the same 8 steps
 * (the second existed only because `core` may not import `web`), and fifteen
 * `Record<Step, string>` tables across six files spelled the class names out by
 * hand, with two more copies of the step→CSS-length resolver. Nothing
 * kept any of them in sync, and the drift was silent — a step present in one
 * union and absent from another produced a missing utility, not a type error.
 *
 * Generating from app.css inverts that: the union IS the stylesheet, so a step
 * with no `@utility` behind it becomes unspellable rather than silently unstyled.
 *
 * THE LITERAL TABLES ARE STILL THE POINT. Tailwind emits an `@utility` only when
 * its source scanner finds the literal token, so `` `rail-x-${step}` `` at a call
 * site compiles to nothing. Generating the literals into a scanned `core/` module
 * keeps the scanner satisfied while removing the copies.
 *
 * Mirrors the `custom-utilities-gen` trio: `renderSpaceRamp` (in-memory),
 * `generateSpaceRamp` (write-on-diff), `spaceRampManifestPath`. Both generators
 * read app.css through the shared `app-css-utilities` scan, and both read it by
 * PATH via fs — a generator must not statically import the ui-kit plugin.
 *
 * ## The declarations
 *
 * ```css
 * /* @ramp steps: none 2xs xs sm md lg xl 2xl *\/
 * /* @ramp families: gap gap-x gap-y p px py pt pr pb pl *\/
 * /* @ramp families: rail rail-x rail-y rail-owe *\/
 * ```
 *
 * Exactly one `steps:` decl; one or more `families:` decls (unioned in file
 * order), so each section of app.css declares its own families next to them.
 *
 * Families are DECLARED, never inferred from suffixes. `control-xs/sm/md/lg`,
 * `control-icon-*` and `control-min-*` share four suffixes with the ramp but are
 * a different 4-step scale — suffix discovery would read them as ramp families
 * missing half their steps.

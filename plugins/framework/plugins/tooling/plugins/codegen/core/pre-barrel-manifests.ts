/**
 * The single source of truth for the PRE-BARREL manifest set.
 *
 * A pre-barrel manifest is a `*.generated.ts` that a plugin barrel imports at
 * module-load (directly or transitively) to register config_v2 descriptors or
 * other load-time state. Bun's ESM cache freezes a module on the first
 * `import()` and a later disk write cannot invalidate it — so EVERY such
 * manifest MUST be regenerated (via a barrel-FREE tree walk) BEFORE the first
 * barrel import in a build run. Otherwise `generateConfigOrigins` re-imports
 * stale barrels, misses the new descriptor, and `pruneOrphanedConfigFiles`
 * deletes the freshly-authored override.
 *
 * Listing the set here (rather than hand-wiring each generator into the
 * pipeline) makes the invariant enforceable: the runtime guard
 * (`assertPreBarrelManifestsFresh`) and the static check
 * (`pre-barrel-manifests-complete`) both read THIS list, so adding a manifest
 * here is the one and only registration point.
 *
 * Membership rule: a manifest belongs here iff a barrel reaches it at
 * module-load AND its renderer is barrel-free (so regenerating it before the
 * first barrel import is sound):
 *   - dataViews: a barrel-free static scan (`skipBarrelImport`).
 *   - customUtilities: reads `app.css` by path only (no plugin tree); reachable
 *     at module-load via the ui-kit web barrel (`cn` → `lib/utils.ts` iterates
 *     `CUSTOM_UTILITY_REGISTRY` at top level).
 *   - spaceRamp: reads `app.css` by path only, same as customUtilities;
 *     reachable at module-load via the spacing web barrel (`<Stack>` resolves its
 *     gap class off `RAMP_CLASSES` at top level).
 *   - fieldsEager / eagerTier: barrel-free `skipBarrelImport` tree scans.
 *
 * A manifest whose renderer NEEDS barrels cannot satisfy that rule and does not
 * belong here — see {@link postWebManifests}.

/**
 * Manifests written BETWEEN the web and the server import phases — after the web
 * barrels a renderer must import to see the truth, before the server barrels

 *
 * The rule that replaces "renderer must be barrel-free": **no WEB barrel may
 * reach one at module-load.** Bun's ESM cache freezes a module on first
 * `import()`, so a web barrel importing one of these would freeze the PREVIOUS
 * run's copy — the very failure the pre-barrel set exists to prevent, one phase
 * later. `pre-barrel-manifests-complete` enforces both halves: reachable from a
 * barrel ⇒ registered somewhere, and registered here ⇒ unreachable from web.
 *
 * The one entry: `reorderableSlots`, whose set is each plugin's own `slots`
 * declaration plus `meta.reorderable` — facts that exist only once the web
 * barrels have evaluated. Only `reorder/server` reads it (the server cannot see
 * web slots); the web runtime derives the same set from the slot objects.

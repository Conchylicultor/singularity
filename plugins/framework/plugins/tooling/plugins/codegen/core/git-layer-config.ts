/**
 * The origin proxy, minus a STALE origin document.
 *
 * `config/<path>/<name>.origin.jsonc` is a *materialization* of the descriptor's
 * defaults — `generateConfigOrigins` writes it with `// @hash
 * computeHash(defaults)`. So a header that no longer matches the descriptor's
 * current defaults says one thing: this file was written by an older shape of
 * the descriptor and has not been regenerated yet. The descriptor is the source;
 * the file is its output. Reading the stale output would answer with the
 * PREVIOUS build's value.
 *
 * That matters inside a single build. Registry codegen runs BEFORE
 * `generateConfigOrigins`, so an edit to a descriptor's defaults (e.g. a
 * composition manifest in `plugin-meta/composition/core/config.ts`) would
 * otherwise not reach the registries until a SECOND build — and the first build
 * would fail `plugins-registry-in-sync` for no visible reason. Dropping the stale
 * origin here makes one build enough.
 *
 * This is the same staleness rule `nonStaleOverrideContent`
 * (`config_v2/core/internal/tier-logic.ts`) already applies to the OVERRIDE layer
 * — an override whose `@hash` no longer matches its origin is ignored — applied
 * one layer down, to the origin against its descriptor.
 *
 * SCOPE. The comparison basis is `descriptor.defaults`, which is the hash
 * `renderOriginJsonc` writes for every descriptor EXCEPT the ones an
 * origin-defaults provider materializes (today: reorder directives, whose
 * defaults are the live contribution catalog, built by an async preparer that
 * needs primed barrels and so cannot run from a synchronous read). Such a
 * descriptor's committed origin always reads as stale here, so it must not be
 * read through {@link readGitLayerConfig} — it would silently resolve to the
 * empty code defaults instead of the authored catalog.

 * what is committed, so a runtime-only (user-layer) edit must not be able to turn
 * a failing repo green — or a passing one red on one machine only.
 *
 * `readTypedConfig` returns `descriptor.defaults` when neither file exists, so a
 * fresh checkout (before any `./singularity build` materializes the origin) still
 * validates the SEEDED defaults. That is intentional — no existence guard — and
 * it is the same answer {@link nonStaleOriginProxy} degrades a stale origin to.

 * Read from the stylesheet by PATH rather than imported from a generated TS
 * manifest, for two reasons. A rule file cannot import a runtime value from
 * another plugin (jiti, which loads `eslint.config.ts`, does not resolve the
 * `@plugins/*` alias). And `build` regenerates its manifests in-process after
 * the lint config is first loaded, so a statically imported manifest would be
 * frozen at its previous contents (`cli:codegen-manifests-not-frozen`). A file
 * read at `buildLintConfig` time is current for every lint pass.
 *
 * The file is listed in {@link LINT_DATA_FILES}, so a change to it invalidates
 * every cached lint result exactly as a rule change does.

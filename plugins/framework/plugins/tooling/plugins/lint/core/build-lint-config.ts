/**
 * Single source of truth for the repo's flat ESLint config.
 *
 * Two consumers build the same rules/plugins from here, differing only in how
 * the parser obtains TypeScript type information and how exemptions apply:
 *
 *   - the root `eslint.config.ts` (editor/IDE + ad-hoc `bunx eslint`) passes
 *     `{ projectService: true }` — typescript-eslint discovers each file's
 *     tsconfig and builds its own program — and `exemptions: "config-off"`;
 *   - the `type-check` check's per-target worker passes `{ programs: [program] }`
 *     — typescript-eslint REUSES a program the worker already built for `tsc`
 *     diagnostics, so the type-program is constructed once, not twice — and
 *     `exemptions: "report"`.
 *
 * Keeping both paths on this one builder means a rule/plugin/exemption change
 * applies identically to the IDE and the check. The contribution loader is
 * shared too (and fails loudly on a dropped contribution), so the type-aware
 * check can never silently enforce a different rule set than the editor.
 *
 * Loaded under Bun (the worker) and under a jiti carrying the `@plugins` alias
 * (`eslint.config.ts`), so `@plugins/*` imports resolve in both.

 *   - Every recommended-latest rule is spread in at "warn" first.
 *   - EVERY currently-known rule is then RE-PINNED to "error" below (the explicit

 *     whole web tree to zero, so all 17 rules are now enforced — a new violation
 *     fails `./singularity check` instead of silently eroding compiler coverage.
 *   - The "warn" spread therefore now only matters as the ON-RAMP for a rule a
 *     FUTURE eslint-plugin-react-hooks version adds: a newly-shipped rule lands at
 *     "warn" by default (green check + a triageable count) rather than instantly
 *     breaking the build, preserving the warn-first-then-ratchet discipline.

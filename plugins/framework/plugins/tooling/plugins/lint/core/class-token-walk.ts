/**
 * The ONE class-token walk, shared by every `no-adhoc-*` class rule.
 *
 * ## Why this is injected rather than imported
 *
 * A `plugins/<name>/lint/*.ts` rule file is dual-loaded: under **jiti** (which
 * loads `eslint.config.ts` and cannot resolve the `@plugins/*` tsconfig alias)
 * and under **Bun** (the type-check worker, where the alias works). So a rule
 * file cannot `import` a runtime value from another plugin — which is why this
 * walk used to be hand-copied into seventeen rule files, six of them fenced by
 * sentinels and held together by a byte-comparison check while the other eleven
 * silently drifted onto an older, weaker copy that resolved no identifiers at
 * all.
 *
 * The constraint binds runtime values only. **jiti erases `import type`**, so a
 * rule file takes the TYPE from here and the VALUE by injection: it default-
 * exports a factory `(toolkit: LintToolkit) => rule`, its plugin's `lint/index.ts`
 * lists it under `classRules`, and `buildLintConfig` calls it with the toolkit
 * built here. Rule files must therefore write `import type { … }` — never
 * `import { type … }`, which `verbatimModuleSyntax` can preserve as a runtime
 * import that jiti would then try (and fail) to resolve.
 *
 * A rule that declared its own walk would be back where we started, so
 * `./singularity check class-token-walk-single-source` fails if any rule file
 * declares one.

/**
 * The ONE traversal both harvesters run: every class-name token reachable from
 * `node`, handed to `emit` with the node it was read from.
 *
 * Directly contained strings are harvested wherever they sit: bare `Literal`
 * `.value`s and `TemplateElement.value.raw`s (split on whitespace), inside
 * `cn(...)`/`clsx(...)` calls, ternaries, `clsx({ "text-x": cond })` object
 * keys, and arbitrary nesting — the walk is structural, not shape-specific.
 *
 * It ALSO follows same-file aliases (see {@link aliasValues}): an `Identifier`
 * reached from a class context is replaced by the value it stands for. The
 * indirections are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - a MAP indexed in a class context (`cn(TONE[tone])`, `styles.title`) is how
 *     a banned class hides in a style/tone table;
 *   - a standalone string `const` referenced from a class context is how a
 *     banned class hides one hoist away. That hoist is not hypothetical: an
 *     author wrote `const ANCHOR_COLUMN = "block-anchor absolute z-raised"`
 *     specifically because a class literal inline in the JSX would be reported;
 *   - an intermediate local or a helper's RESULT (`const sz =
 *     geometryFor(p, s)` → `SIZE_MAP[size]`) is how a size table hid behind a
 *     function — the avatar's `SIZE_MAP` carried raw font sizes no rule saw.
 *
 * A rule anchored on a position teaches authors where the position isn't, so
 * the walk follows the value instead of guarding the position.
 *
 * A `cva(...)` CALL is walked like any class builder (its base and variant
 * values are literal classes), but a styling-function RESULT — an identifier
 * bound to `cva(...)` and later called — is not followed: the table is checked
 * where it is written. Name slots (object keys, `.property` names) are skipped,
 * never resolved as aliases. Resolution is same-file only. Because the walk
 * only ever starts from a real class-name context, an unrelated doc-string that
 * merely mentions `text-sm` is never inspected.

/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-file-sink` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans append-mode filesystem writers (a hand-rolled durable sink that
 * escapes the declared/bounded/enumerable invariant). It fires on: an fs
 * append/stream import specifier (incl. alias), member access on an fs namespace/
 * default import, a re-export of one, `Bun.file(x).writer()`, and an append
 * smuggled through a whole-file writer via `{ flag: "a" }`. Whole-file writes,
 * fs READ imports, and type-only imports stay valid.
 *
 * Fixtures embed the banned imports as RuleTester `code` STRINGS, so this test
 * file's own AST contains no real fs import — it is not self-flagged and needs no
 * allowlist entry.

/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-profiler-seam` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans importing the runtime-profiler observation seams (onSlowSpan /
 * captureFlightWindow / readGateGauges) from the profiler core barrel outside the
 * three sanctioned owners. The sibling pull APIs on the SAME barrel
 * (getRuntimeProfile, registerGateGauge) stay valid, as do type-only imports and
 * relative imports (the profiler's own internals).
 *
 * Fixtures embed the imports as RuleTester `code` STRINGS, so this test file's own
 * AST holds no real seam import — it is not self-flagged. Owner-directory
 * short-circuiting is exercised via the `filename` option.

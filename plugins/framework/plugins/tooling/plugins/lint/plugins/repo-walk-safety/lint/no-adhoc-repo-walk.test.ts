/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-repo-walk` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans the hand-written list of build-output directory names that
 * every ad-hoc repo walk begins with. It fires on an array or `new Set([...])`
 * containing `"node_modules"` TOGETHER WITH a build-output companion
 * (`"dist"`, `".git"`, `".cache"`, …).
 *
 * The pairing is what makes it precise: `"node_modules"` alone appears in
 * plenty of legitimate code (path building, resolution tests), and it is the
 * enumeration of several such directories together that means "I am about to
 * decide for myself what counts as source" — the decision that belongs to git.

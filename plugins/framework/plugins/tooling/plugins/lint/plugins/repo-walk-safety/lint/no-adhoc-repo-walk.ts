 * The name of the one directory every hand-written build-output deny-list
 * begins with, and the names it is paired with. A list containing
 * `"node_modules"` AND at least one of these is a deny-list — nobody writes that
 * pair for any other reason.
 *
 * Requiring the PAIR is what keeps the rule precise. Plenty of code mentions
 * `"node_modules"` alone for a legitimate reason (building a path into it,
 * testing whether one specifier resolves there); it is the enumeration of
 * *several* build-output directory names together that says "I am about to walk
 * the repo and decide for myself what counts as source".

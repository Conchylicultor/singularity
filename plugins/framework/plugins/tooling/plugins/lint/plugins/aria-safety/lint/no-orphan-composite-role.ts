/**
 * A composite ARIA role is a CONTRACT, not a label: `listbox` promises options,
 * `tablist` promises tabs, `grid` promises rows. Assistive tech honors the
 * promise — it presents the subtree as that widget and commonly DROPS whatever
 * is not one of the required children. So a composite role declared over a
 * subtree that has none of them is strictly worse than no role at all: it
 * announces an empty widget AND hides the real content behind it.
 *
 * That was the page editor's bug. The block-selection container carried
 * `role="listbox" aria-multiselectable`, nothing below it carried
 * `role="option"`, and the result was a screen reader reading an empty list of
 * options where a document of headings, lists and paragraphs actually lived.
 *
 * The pairing is knowable statically at the only altitude where it IS knowable
 * — the file that declares the container. This rule reads that altitude: a
 * container role must be joined, in the same file, by at least one element
 * carrying one of the child roles it requires.

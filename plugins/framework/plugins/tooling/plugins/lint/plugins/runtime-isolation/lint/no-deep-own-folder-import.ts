/**
 * no-deep-own-folder-import
 *
 * A file that ships in a browser artifact may reach a SIBLING folder of its own
 * plugin only through that folder's barrel: `../../core`, never
 * `../../core/merge-group-values`.
 *
 * The web-artifact builder routes every import that lands in one of the
 * plugin's own non-inlined folders — the barrel AND any deep file — to that
 * folder's `@plugins/<own>/<folder>` barrel artifact (`ownFolderBarrelPlugin`,
 * web-artifacts `core/internal/vite-builder.ts`). It has to: inlining a private
 * copy of `core/x` next to the core artifact every other plugin loads would give
 * the page two instances of its module state. So in the browser a deep import
 * MEANS the barrel, while `tsc` reads it as the file. Whenever the symbol is not
 * in the barrel the two disagree, every check passes, and the build fails ~5
 * minutes in at compose (`"…/theme-engine/core" does not export
 * "mergeGroupValues"` — the outage this rule was written for). Spelled as the
 * barrel, the import means the same thing to both, and a missing export is an
 * ordinary type error in the editor.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Importers: `web/`, `core/`, `shared/`, `fixtures/` — the folders that end
 *     up in browser artifacts (`shared/` is inlined into each). A `server/` or
 *     `check/` file runs under Bun, which loads the file itself, so its deep
 *     imports mean what they say.
 *   - Targets: any other top-level folder of the same plugin, except `shared/`
 *     (inlined into every artifact, usually barrel-less), `plugins/` (other
 *     plugins — the boundary check's business) and `node_modules/`. CSS and
 *     `?query` imports are skipped exactly as the builder skips them.
 *   - Type-only imports included: a type that crosses a folder is that folder's
 *     public API, and belongs in its barrel like any other export.
 *
 * The autofix rewrites the specifier to the barrel — the module the browser
 * already loads, so it changes nothing at runtime; `tsc` then names any symbol
 * the barrel still has to export.

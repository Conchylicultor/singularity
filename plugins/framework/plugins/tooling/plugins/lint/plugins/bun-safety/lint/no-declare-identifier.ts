/**
 * Identifier names that Bun's TS transform silently miscompiles in value
 * position. `declare` is a TS contextual keyword: a statement that begins with
 * `declare` (e.g. `declare.foo = …` referencing a `const declare = …`) is parsed
 * by Bun as a TS *ambient declaration* and ERASED from the emitted JS — no type
 * error, no runtime error, the value is just `undefined` at runtime. tsc keeps
 * it (verified against ts.transpileModule), so this is a Bun divergence, not
 * expected TS behavior. Empirically `declare` is the only contextual keyword
 * with this hazard (`enum`/`let` fail loudly as reserved words; every other
 * keyword transpiles correctly). A Set so a future Bun regression on another
 * name is a one-line add.

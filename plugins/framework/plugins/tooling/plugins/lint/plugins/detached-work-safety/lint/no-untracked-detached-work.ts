// Wrappers that self-attribute their body to a span (or deliberately opt out of

// named span (`runTracked` / `recordEntrySpan`: a `bg`/entry span; `captureTrace`
// / `recordReport`: wrap their own DB writes in runInBackgroundLane +
// runWithoutProfiling; `enqueue`: the jobs worker opens a `job` span per run;
// `runWithoutProfiling` / `runInBackgroundLane`: observability-internal opt-outs).

/**
 * Off-main-thread entry points: code that runs on a Bun `Worker` thread or in a
 * spawned child process, NOT on the backend's main event loop. The
 * runtime-profiler is installed only on main, so `runTracked` there is a no-op —
 * and for subprocess probes it is outright forbidden (importing the plugin
 * runtime would pull the whole plugin graph into the measured process's heap and
 * destroy the footprint measurement it exists to take). So detached work in these
 * files has no span to attribute to and the rule does not apply.
 *
 * Two greppable, self-documenting conventions — extend this predicate as new
 * off-main entries are added, rather than adding per-line disables:
 *   • a `/worker/` path segment — a Bun Worker-thread subtree (e.g. the sentinel
 *     sampler/latch worker; the whole directory runs off-main).
 *   • an `entry.ts` basename — the spawned worker / child-process entry-point
 *     convention (the sentinel worker, the paging-probe child process).
 * The on-main *supervisor* that spawns these (e.g. `worker-host.ts` /
 * `probe-host.ts`) is NOT exempt — it runs on main and stays subject to the rule.

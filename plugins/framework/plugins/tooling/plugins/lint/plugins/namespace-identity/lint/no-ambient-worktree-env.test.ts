/**
 * Tests for the `no-ambient-worktree-env` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans the retired `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` name from code anywhere but
 * the one transition file, whether it is written as an identifier
 * (`process.env.SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, an `env:` key, a destructuring) or as the
 * bare string (`process.env["SINGULARITY_WORKTREE"]`).
 *
 * Fixtures are RuleTester `code` STRINGS, so the name inside them is one token
 * of a longer template and this file's own AST holds no bare occurrence — which
 * matters more here than for most rules, since the rule is opted into test files
 * via `enforceEverywhere`.

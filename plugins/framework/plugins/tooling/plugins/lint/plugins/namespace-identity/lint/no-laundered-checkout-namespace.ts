 * against, only a name in the source. `asNamespace` itself is not the problem:
 * it is the documented boundary cast, and `asNamespace(row.worktree)` on a DB
 * column or `asNamespace(host)` on a URL are exactly what it is for. What it may
 * not be handed is a NAME someone derived from a filesystem path.

 * `basename` is the same value with the helper's name filed off — it is how the

 * — a fallback, where the laundering sits one operator down and a rule matching
 * only the direct nesting would have seen nothing at the one site that mattered.
 * So logical fallbacks, ternaries and type assertions are stepped through; each
 * of their branches is a value the cast can actually receive.

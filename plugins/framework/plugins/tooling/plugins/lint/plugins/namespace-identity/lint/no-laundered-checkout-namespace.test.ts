/**
 * Tests for the `no-laundered-checkout-namespace` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans `asNamespace(...)` around a checkout NAME — `checkoutWorktreeName(…)`
 * or a bare `basename(…)` — including when the name reaches the cast through a
 * `??` fallback or a ternary, which is how the one live instance in the e2e
 * harness was written. `asNamespace` itself stays valid everywhere it is used as
 * the documented boundary cast (a DB column, a URL host, a spec-dir entry name),
 * and both helpers stay valid on their own; only the composition is banned.
 *
 * Fixtures are RuleTester `code` STRINGS, so this file's own AST holds no real
 * `asNamespace` call and the rule does not flag its own tests. That matters more
 * here than for most rules: this one is opted into test and e2e files via
 * `enforceEverywhere`, precisely because the bug it closes was written in an e2e
 * file.

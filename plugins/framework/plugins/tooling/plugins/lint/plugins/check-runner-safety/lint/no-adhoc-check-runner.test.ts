/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-check-runner` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans the VALUE import of `runChecks` from the checks core barrel
 * everywhere except the check command's own file. The sibling exports on the SAME
 * barrel (`RunChecksOptions`, `listAllChecks`, `scopeOf`, `markBuildInProgress`)
 * stay valid, as do type-only imports.
 *
 * Fixtures embed the specifier as RuleTester `code` STRINGS, so this test file's
 * own AST holds no real `runChecks` import — it is not self-flagged (which matters
 * more here than for most rules: this one is opted into test files via
 * `enforceEverywhere`, because a suite that drives the runner writes to the same
 * global cache a later push reads). Owner short-circuiting is exercised via the
 * `filename` option.

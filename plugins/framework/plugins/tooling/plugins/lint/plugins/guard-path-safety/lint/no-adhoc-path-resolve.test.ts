/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-path-resolve` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans VALUE imports from `node:path` (and bare `path`) inside
 * `guards/core/guards/**`, so that every filesystem path a guard compares comes
 * out of `core/argv.ts` rather than being built from a guessed operand. Type-only
 * imports stay valid, and the rule is inert outside that directory — it is
 * configured repo-wide, so the self-limit is what keeps it from firing on the
 * thousands of files that legitimately import `join`.
 *
 * Filenames are supplied via the RuleTester `filename` option, which is what the
 * directory short-circuit reads. The two production exemptions (`main-edits.ts`,
 * `git-diff-main.ts`) are NOT tested here: they live in the barrel's `ignores`
 * globs, which the root eslint config applies — the rule itself flags them, and
 * a case asserting otherwise would encode the wrong contract.

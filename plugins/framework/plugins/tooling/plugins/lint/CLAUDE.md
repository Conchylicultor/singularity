## Where a contributed rule applies

A plugin contributes rules via `plugins/<name>/lint/index.ts`; the root
`eslint.config.ts` and the `type-check` check both build from
[`core/build-lint-config.ts`](core/build-lint-config.ts), so the IDE and the
check can never enforce different sets.

Contributed rules apply repo-wide **to app code**, and are **off in test and e2e
files** — the `test` and `e2e` file categories of
[`tooling/exempt`](../exempt/CLAUDE.md) (`NON_APP_FILE_CATEGORIES`).

The reason is what these rules are: nearly all of them enforce the app's
*composition* — use the `Row` primitive, use the spacing ramp, route scroll
writes through `auto-scroll`, render collections as a DataView. A test suite and
a Playwright driver are not part of that composition; they observe the app from
outside. For `e2e/` the boundary rules go further and **forbid** importing the
primitives those rules point at (the `e2e` runtime may reach `core` and other
`e2e` barrels, never `web`) — so the rule's own suggested remedy is unreachable
from the file it fires on, and the only way out is an inline disable. A rule that
can only be satisfied by disabling it is not enforcing anything.

This does **not** relax the base config: typescript-eslint and the react-hooks /
React Compiler diagnostics still apply everywhere.

### Opting a rule back in

A rule that catches a genuine **bug** rather than a design deviation should stay
on everywhere. Declare it in the lint barrel:

```ts
export default {
  name: "promise-safety",
  rules: { "no-bare-catch": noBareCatch, /* … */ },
  enforceEverywhere: ["no-bare-catch", /* … */],
};
```

`promise-safety` opts all three of its rules back in: a test is exactly where an
unawaited promise or a swallowed error is most damaging, because it makes a suite
pass while asserting nothing. A rule id in `enforceEverywhere` that the plugin
does not define fails the config build loudly, so a typo can't silently leave a
rule off.

Type the barrel `satisfies LintContribution`. A rule owner declares only
scope: `outOfScope: { "<rule>": FileCategory[] }` and `closed: ["<rule>"]`.
Which files may violate a rule is declared by the plugin owning them, in its
own `exempt/index.ts` — see [`tooling/exempt`](../exempt/CLAUDE.md). The
owner-side `ignores` key no longer exists: a barrel carrying it is a tsc error and fails at load.

## Class rules take the shared walk — they do not copy it

A rule that reads Tailwind class tokens uses the ONE walk in
[`core/class-token-walk.ts`](core/class-token-walk.ts). The rule
takes the type by import and the value by injection — default-export a factory,
and list it under **`classRules`** (not `rules`):

```ts
import type { LintToolkit } from "@plugins/framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/lint/core";

export default function buildRule({ collectTokens, CLASS_ATTRS }: LintToolkit) {
  return createRule({ /* … */ });
}
```

Write `import type { … }`, never `import { type … }` — `verbatimModuleSyntax`
can keep the latter as a runtime import, which breaks config loading under jiti.
Tests run under Bun, so they build the rule with the real `lintToolkit`,
imported from `@plugins/framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/lint/core/testing`.

The toolkit also carries **`declaredUtilities`**: every custom `@utility` in
app.css, read when the config is built (`core/declared-utilities.ts`), so a rule
can tell a class that exists from one Tailwind would silently compile to
nothing (`space-ramp/no-dead-spacing`). A rule must never import a generated
manifest for such facts: `build` regenerates manifests after loading the rules,
so an imported one would be stale (`cli:codegen-manifests-not-frozen`). A file
a rule reads is listed in `LINT_DATA_FILES`, which the type-check cache treats
as a global trigger.

`class-token-walk-single-source` fails if a rule file declares `collectTokens` /
`baseClass` / `CLASS_ATTRS` / `CLASS_BUILDERS` of its own. It replaced a check
that held six hand-copied walks byte-identical: eleven *other* rules carried an
older copy outside its list and had silently drifted, so the copies could not
see a class string parked in a `const` or a style map.

The class builders the walk starts from are `cn`, `clsx`, `twMerge` and `cva`.
A `cva(...)` table's base string and variant values are classes, so every
class rule reads them (the sidebar's `text-xs` once hid there); its variant
NAMES are non-computed identifier object keys, which the walk skips rather than
resolving as aliases. A rule reports a `cva` violation at the call, so a
justified per-site disable sits above the `cva(` line and covers the table.

The walk follows a same-file identifier to the VALUE it stands for, whatever
shape that value has: a string, a map, a lookup into one (`const sz =
SIZE[s]`), a ternary, a `satisfies` wrapper, or a call — whose callee, when it
is a same-file function, stands for its return values (`const sz =
geometryFor(p, s)` → `SIZE_MAP[size]`; the avatar's raw font sizes hid there).
Member and key NAMES (`sz.box`, `{ size: … }`) are never resolved as aliases.
One stop: through an alias, the walk does not re-enter a class-builder call
(`const cls = cond ? cn(…) : …`, `buttonVariants = cva(…)`) — that call is a
check site of its own, and a second report at the use would land on a line
its disable does not cover. Parameters and imports have no in-file value.

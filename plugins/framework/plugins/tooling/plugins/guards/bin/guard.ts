/**
 * The directories outside the checkout an agent may write into, read from their
 * owners' declarations at hook time.
 *
 * `bin/` is where this can happen at all: a `data-dirs` module is importable
 * from `server`/`shared`/`bin`, never from `core/`, so the guards themselves
 * cannot name a data dir (see `GuardContext.writableDataDirs`). Reading
 * `.path` here — a getter, resolved per read — is what keeps the guard aligned
 * with the declaration when the directory moves.
 *
 * Prototypes qualify precisely because they are NOT in git: `prototypes/CLAUDE.md`
 * tells every agent to write its mock into this tree, and the declaration's
 * `reclaim: never` says the folder on disk is the only copy of that work.

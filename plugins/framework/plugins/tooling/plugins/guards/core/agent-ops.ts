 *
 * The stop hook has to answer "is this agent about to walk away from its own
 * op?", and neither half of that is available at stop time. The op marker on
 * disk says a build is running in this checkout but not who asked for it; the
 * stop payload names the agent but not what it started. A parent's build would
 * otherwise pin every subagent under it, which is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * So the PreToolUse guard, which sees both at once, writes it down here.
 *
 * Session-scoped in tmpdir, exactly like `poll-loop`'s window: it is a fact
 * about one live conversation, worthless after it, and must never be something
 * a reader has to clean up. Entries are pruned by age on every read and write.

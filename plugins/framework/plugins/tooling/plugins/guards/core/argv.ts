/**
 * Splits one shell call's argv into flags and the operands that NAME A FILE.
 *
 * Guards used to do this with `call.args.filter((a) => !a.startsWith("-"))` and
 * then `resolve(call.cwd, …)` on the survivors. That is not a parse, it is a
 * guess: every token that is not flag-shaped becomes a path. A `sed -i ''
 * 's|resolve(HERE, "../../../..");|…|' cli/singularity.ts` was blocked as a
 * write to the main checkout, because `path.resolve` normalised the `..`
 * sequences INSIDE the substitution script and landed them under the repo root.
 * The same guess also missed real writes — `cp -t <main> a.ts` treats the
 * destination as a flag, `rm -- -weird` filters the operand away as one.
 *
 * So a per-command table records which flags take a value and which of those
 * values is a destination, and the walk below is the one place that knows how
 * an argv is shaped. No guard invents a path from a token again.
 *
 * ## Totality
 *
 * `parseArgv` never throws and always answers. An unknown command falls through
 * to an empty grammar, which reproduces the old behaviour exactly: `-`-leading
 * tokens are flags, everything else is an operand. This runs inside a PreToolUse
 * hook on every single Bash call, so a command nobody modelled must parse
 * conservatively rather than fail the tool call.
 *
 * `files: []` is legitimate emptiness, not an absorbed failure: `git status` and
 * a `sed` without `-i` genuinely write nothing. There is no failure arm to
 * confuse it with — the answer to "which operands name a file" is a list, and
 * for many commands that list is correctly empty.
 *
 * ## Resolved paths, not raw strings
 *
 * `parse-shell.ts` already warns that a call's relative args must be resolved
 * against `call.cwd` or `cd <dir> && rm <rel>` slips past. Doing the resolve
 * here makes that unforgettable. `raw` is kept beside the resolved path so a
 * guard's message can echo what the agent actually typed.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `reads` output. No caller needs one, and a partial
 * one would be a half-truth: `sed -i` reads its input files too, so a read set
 * built from `-r`/`-f`/`--reference` alone would systematically understate.

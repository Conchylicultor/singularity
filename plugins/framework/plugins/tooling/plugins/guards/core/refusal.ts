/**
 * The first lines of EVERY guard denial: what did not happen because of it.
 *
 * A guard's own message says why the call was refused. It seldom says that
 * NOTHING in the call ran, and an agent that misses that goes on as though the
 * rest of it had. Measured: a Bash call that edited a file with an inline
 * `python3` heredoc and then ran `./singularity check` was denied by
 * `background-ops` over the check. The edit never happened, and the agent went
 * on to build, deploy and report a fix that was never on disk.
 *
 * So the runner puts this in front of every denial rather than leaving each
 * guard to remember it. It is keyed by tool, not by guard: what "did not run"
 * means depends on the tool, and `Record<ToolMatcher, …>` makes a new tool
 * matcher a tsc error until it says what did not happen.

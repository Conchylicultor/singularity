 * Newest mtime among the files a command actually reads, recorded at every look

 * one that does not exist yet (waiting for a file to APPEAR is the pathological
 * loop, not forensics) or is still empty (an empty output is not a result).
 *
 * ## Why a non-existent operand is skipped, not disqualifying
 *
 * `argv.ts` models the commands that WRITE, so a reader nobody modelled falls
 * through to the default grammar where every non-flag token is an operand —
 * `grep -c "sub-ack" app.jsonl` names a file called `sub-ack`, `jq '.result' f`
 * one called `.result`. That over-collection is the safe direction for a guard
 * asking "what might this command clobber", and the wrong one here.
 *
 * Skipping what does not resolve is not the same guess in reverse. A write
 * guard must never MISS a target, so it takes every candidate; this one must
 * never INVENT a file, and a token naming nothing on disk is not a file the
 * command read — a fact, not an inference. What the two share is that neither
 * builds a path itself: both read the operands `parseArgv` resolved.

/**
 * A backgrounded `./singularity` command gets the longest life the harness
 * allows.
 *
 * `run_in_background` is not untimed: the harness stops a background task after
 * its `timeout`, 30 minutes when the call names none. Build p90 is 36.8 min and
 * push p90 35.7 min (op-log, 14 days — see `background-ops`), and an e2e script
 * can sit 30+ min in the host CPU queue before it starts, so the default kills a
 * real share of ops that were healthy. The kill leaves a build `running` with a
 * dead pid and no verdict.
 *
 * Every subcommand, not only the long ones: nothing about a `./singularity`
 * command is made better by being killed at 30 minutes, and a list would have
 * to guess which `run` script is an op. A rewrite, not a denial — the fix is
 * mechanical and changes nothing the agent meant. An explicit timeout the agent
 * typed is raised too: none shorter than the ceiling serves an op.

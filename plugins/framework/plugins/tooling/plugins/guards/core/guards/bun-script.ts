 *
 * Missing an entry can only over-block (a flag's `.ts` value is mistaken for the

 * some flag's value — so the set stays deliberately small rather than mirroring

 * The discriminator is the token, not the presence of `run`: `bun run <name>`
 * resolves a package.json script — a *bin*, which has no module-resolution
 * problem — while `bun run <file>.ts` and bare `bun <file>.ts` both load a
 * module. So the scan walks past flags and past an optional leading `run`, then
 * asks one question of the first operand it reaches. Every other subcommand
 * (`install`, `test`, `add`, `build`, `x`, …) falls out for free: none of them
 * is spelled as a module path.

That is how an e2e script came to launch a Playwright the lockfile never chose, demanding a chromium revision nothing had provisioned.",

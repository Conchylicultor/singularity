/**
 * The stop half of the guards: refuse to let an agent end its turn while an op
 * it started is still running.
 *
 * `background-ops` can only advise — it speaks at the moment the op starts, and
 * an agent that ignores the advice ten tool calls later is exactly the agent
 * this exists for. A stop hook is the only place the harness asks a question we
 * can answer with "no": Claude Code lets `Stop`, `SubagentStop` and
 * `TeammateIdle` be refused with `{"decision":"block","reason":…}`, and hands
 * the reason to the agent as what to do instead.
 *
 * Two events matter, not one. `SubagentStop` covers a one-shot Agent-tool
 * subagent; `TeammateIdle` covers a NAMED teammate going idle — and the
 * teammates are what stalled in the incident this was written for
 * (`curriculum-web`, `curriculum-core`), so covering only the first would miss
 * the measured case entirely.
 *
 * ## Why this can never wedge a session
 *
 * Three independent reasons, because a stop hook that gets it wrong is far worse
 * than the bug it fixes:
 *
 * 1. It blocks only an agent that has an op of its OWN still running — a
 *    recorded start (`agent-ops`) AND a live marker for it right now.
 * 2. The remedy is one command, and that command always terminates: an
 *    `./singularity await` caps itself at 8 minutes and exits.
 * 3. Claude Code overrides the hook after 8 consecutive blocks regardless.

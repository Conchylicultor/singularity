// Carry-forward: a SERVED dist keeps serving every address it has ever served,
// for as long as the shared cache still holds the bytes behind it.
//
// A tab resolves every import through the import map baked into the page it
// loaded, so a tab booted from an older build asks for that build's addresses —
// lazily, possibly hours later (the deferred plugin tier, fonts). Each build
// used to serve only its own addresses, so every plugin that changed since the
// tab booted 404'd and the browser remembered the failure for the life of the
// page. The files themselves were still in the cache, just no longer linked.
//
// Serving an old address is safe because every address is write-once: an
// artifact's name is a hash of everything its bytes inline, and the store, the
// vendor sets and the CSS cache all discard a second publish of an existing
// address. So an old tab gets byte-for-byte the files it was built with, and it
// cannot reach a newer build's files through its own map. (Why this lives in
// `cli/` and not `core/`: see ../index.ts.)

 * Before a served dist is published, copy into `stagingDir` every entry the

 *
 * - `artifacts/<name>` — a symlink to an absolute path in the artifact store or
 *   the vendors dir. Recreated as the same link iff its target still exists. A
 *   target exists only once fully published (it is renamed into place after its
 *   `meta.json` is written), so existence is an exact test. A link whose target
 *   is gone is dropped: an honest 404 instead of a dangling link.
 * - `assets/<file>` — the global stylesheet and its fonts, which are COPIED into
 *   every dist rather than linked, so their mtime says nothing about age. One is
 *   kept only while some CSS cache dir still contains a file of that name (the
 *   names are content-hashed by vite, so a name is its bytes).
 *
 * Because each served dist already contains everything carried into it, a
 * build only diffs against the one dist before it. The carried set is therefore
 * "everything this namespace ever served that the cache still holds", bounded
 * by the cache's own pruning (14 days after last use). Carrying never touches a
 * target's mtime, so it never extends that life.
 *
 * Only for a SERVED dist. A release is served by nobody and ships its dist
 * materialized; it never carries.
 *
 * ACCEPTED RACE — do not "fix" it with a lock: another worktree's build may
 * prune a target between the existence check here and the publish swap. That
 * one address then 404s until this namespace's next publish drops the link.
 * Serializing every build's prune against every other build's publish would
 * cost far more than the rare 404 it prevents.
 *
 * No-op when `liveDir` does not exist (the namespace's first build).
 *
 * @param opts.liveDir the served dist, still resolving to the PREVIOUS build.
 * @param opts.stagingDir this build's dist, fully composed, not yet published.
 * @param opts.cssCacheRoot test seam; defaults to {@link globalCssCacheRoot}.

/**
 * Build the Rollup `external` predicate for one plugin artifact.
 *
 * - Other plugins' `@plugins/*` specifiers → external (import map).
 * - An OWN-path specifier `@plugins/<own>/<seg>[/deep]` → inlined iff `seg` is
 *   one of `inlinedRootsFor(kind)`; every other own folder is external, routed
 *   to its own barrel artifact. One URL = one module instance: any folder that
 *   ships as its own artifact can hold module state, and inlining a private
 *   copy of it next to the artifact other plugins load would double-instantiate
 *   it. That covers own sub-plugins too (`@plugins/<own>/plugins/…` are
 *   DIFFERENT plugins — `plugins` is never an inlined root).
 * - Bare npm specifiers → external unless the package is inline-allowlisted.
 *
 * `ownPluginPath` is null for the composition-root entry artifact (web-core),
 * which has no `@plugins` self-specifier — its own files are reached relatively.

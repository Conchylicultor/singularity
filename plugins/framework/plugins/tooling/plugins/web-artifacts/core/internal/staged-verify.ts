// Ground-truth verification of the staged dist: re-scan the ACTUAL `.js`/`.mjs`
// files the browser will fetch (through the store symlinks) and verify both
// halves of every import — that its specifier RESOLVES (bare through the import
// map, relative to a real staged file), and that the resolved target actually
// EXPORTS every name the importer binds. Deliberately INDEPENDENT of the
// builders' recorded `meta.json`: the metadata-based coverage check shares its
// scanner with the map assembly, so a scanner blind spot makes the map and the
// check wrong identically (the unscanned-`.mjs`-chunks outage). This pass shares
// no inputs with the planner — it reads the staged bytes.
//
// The link half restores a guarantee the artifact build traded away: because
// cross-plugin imports stay external and an importer's hash excludes its
// target's contents, renaming an export in B leaves A reused-unrebuilt from the
// store, and nothing ever re-reads A against the new B. `type-check` compensates
// only partially (it is skipped by `--skip-checks`, and casts/stale `.d.ts`
// typecheck green while the emitted bytes disagree). This is the whole composed
// fleet's bytes, checked on every build.

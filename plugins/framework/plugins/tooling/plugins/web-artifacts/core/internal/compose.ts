/**
 * The CONTENT identity of everything a loaded tab is frozen on — a pure function

 *
 * - `shell` — the SOURCE `index.html`, whose head carries executable inline
 *   scripts (the theme replay, the DevTools hook). Those run once at load and
 *   live in the tab from then on, so editing one changes the served bytes with
 *   no effect on any URL. Hashed as its own tagged line; without it a tab could
 *   hold a genuinely different bundle and still read as fresh.
 * - `entry` / `css` / `map` / `preload` — the module graph. Every value is
 *   already content-addressed, so a code change moves a URL and therefore the
 *   digest.
 *
 * NOT covered, deliberately: the `public/` static files copied verbatim beside
 * index.html (icons, manifest). They are served bytes but nothing freezes them
 * into a running tab — the browser refetches them by URL under its own cache
 * rules — so an icon edit would cost every open tab a reload and buy nothing.
 * If a `public/` file ever becomes something the tab executes at boot, it joins
 * the `shell` line and this paragraph is wrong.
 *
 * Also NOT the COMPOSED html: the commit injected into it moves with the tree
 * even when the graph does not, and hashing the output would reintroduce exactly
 * the per-build churn this replaced — the run-id nonce that made two byte-
 * identical deploys look like different bundles.
 *
 * Entries are tagged and key-sorted so neither object-literal order nor a
 * URL that happens to look like a tag can shift the digest. 16 hex chars, the
 * same width the store uses for an artifact's address.

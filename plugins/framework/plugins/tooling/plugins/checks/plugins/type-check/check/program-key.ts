// A content key for a tsc program, and the host-global record of which such
// programs have passed.
//
// Why a key at all: a miss on the outer (whole-check) cache rebuilds the
// program even when the edit cannot have changed what it contains — a docs
// commit that happens to sit in the same tree as a `.ts` the outer read-set
// recorded, a generated registry rewritten to identical bytes. The key below
// says "this exact program passed before", so a worker with nothing to compute
// does not run. (It was once a key PER TARGET, when there were seven
// overlapping programs and an edit under a plugin's `web/` still rebuilt
// `server-core`. There is one program now, and the key is what still makes an
// unchanged tree free.)
//
// THIS KEY DECIDES WHETHER A WORKER RUNS. A recorded match means tsc is not
// invoked at all, so the key IS the verdict — there is
// no compiler behind it to catch a key that was too loose. That is why the
// envelope below is spelled out in full, and why anything unclear (no
// buildinfo, a shape we do not recognise) yields NO key and a cold run rather
// than a guess. Design and measurements:
// research/2026-09-08-global-type-check-per-target-program-skip.md.
//
// Soundness, in one paragraph. A program is a function of (roots, file
// contents, compiler options). `L_t` — the `fileNames` tsc itself wrote into
// the program's `.tsbuildinfo` — is the exact set of files it loaded on
// some earlier tree. If every file in `L_t` has identical content now and the
// roots are identical, module resolution runs the same and yields the same
// program, hence the same verdict. Roots are covered by `R_t`; options by the
// tsconfig contents; `node_modules` contents are hashed directly rather than
// trusted through `bun.lock`, which closes the hand-patched-dependency hole;
// the worker's own behaviour is code, covered by `selfSourceHash`. The one way
// resolution can change with no content in `L_t` changing is a NEWLY ADDED file
// shadowing a resolution (`foo.ts` appearing beside `foo/index.ts`), which
// `allTsNames` closes by over-invalidating on any added or removed TypeScript
// file anywhere.
//
// The one edge outside the envelope, stated so nobody has to rediscover it: a
// file ADDED inside `node_modules` with no lockfile change. Modified dependency
// files are caught (their contents are hashed directly), removed ones too (the
// hash becomes `"-"`), and any real `bun install` rewrites `bun.lock`, which is
// in the key. Only a file hand-copied into `node_modules` can shadow a
// resolution invisibly — and enumerating a hundred thousand dependency paths on
// every run to close that is not a trade worth making.

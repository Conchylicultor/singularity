// per-target program-pass record (key = a tsc program's content key). Both are
// host-global on purpose: a fresh worktree reuses whatever a sibling recorded
// for an identical key, which is the whole reason the key is content-addressed
// rather than tree- or worktree-scoped.

// Sharing one implementation means the atomic write, the age/count bounds and
// the throttled sweep are written once. Each store still declares its OWN data
// dir (`data-dirs/index.ts`), because the reclaim audit describes directories,

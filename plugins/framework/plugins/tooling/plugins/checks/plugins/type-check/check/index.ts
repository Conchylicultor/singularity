/**
 * `type-check` — the unified TypeScript + type-aware-ESLint check.
 *
 * The old `typescript` and `eslint` checks each built the full TS program over
 * the repo (tsc for diagnostics, typescript-eslint via projectService for the
 * type-aware rules). Type-aware linting is ~99% TS-program construction — the
 * same work tsc does — so the cold cost was paid twice. This check builds the
 * repo's ONE program once, in a worker process, and reads both tsc diagnostics
 * and lint results off it.
 *
 * One program, not seven. Until 2026-09-18 there was a tsc target per runtime
 * (web-core, server-core, central-core, cli, tooling, tools, test); measured,
 * they held 30,649 file instances for 8,252 distinct files, and six of them
 * loaded the identical type environment. The split cost 3.7 checks of the
 * average file per cold miss and bought no type isolation.
 *
 * Warm paths are preserved: tsc stays incremental via the shared `.tsbuildinfo`,
 * lint reuses the per-file closure cache (only closure-changed files are
 * re-linted), and a program whose content key is already recorded green runs no
 * worker at all.
 *
 * This file runs on the check runner's thread, which every other check in the
 * pass shares, so it holds nothing that reads file bytes or walks the tree: the
 * git reads (async), the outer read-set, the grant spend, the log lines and
 * the verdict. Everything else — 70–130 s of synchronous work — runs on the
 * preparation thread (`./prepare-thread`, `./prepare`).

// samples alone. See research/2026-07-12-global-host-admission-memory-dimension.md.
// It is also what `TYPE_CHECK_WORKER_UNITS` (`../core`) is measured from, so
// these lines are the instrument behind the weight this check spends.
//
// Units are DECIMAL (1 GB = 1e9 B, 1 MB = 1e6 B), the same convention as the
// CLI's own footprint lines (cli/plugins/build/cli/run.ts `maxRssLine`), because
// PER_UNIT_BYTES is decimal. Labelling a 2**30 division "GB" would understate
// the byte count by ~7% and silently corrupt the very constant these lines
// calibrate. Kept as a private 5-line pure formatter rather than importing the
// CLI's copy: `bin/` is not an importable barrel, and one duplicated formatter
// beats inventing a shared plugin for it.
//
// CPU seconds sit beside the peak because they are the only load-independent
// cost this worker has: the identical program build measured 105s at load 12.8
// and 266s at load 14.0, so a wall-clock before/after on a shared box measures
// the neighbours. Every claim about what this check costs — and the skip's
// whole payoff — is read off these numbers.

// research/2026-07-17-global-input-keyed-check-cache.md §2.5 + Stage 2).
//
// The OUTER whole-tree cache used to force type-check.run() to rebuild the import
// graph and spawn the full tsc worker fleet on ANY tree change — even a docs-only
// one — because its verdict was keyed on the entire working-tree hash. (Its INNER
// per-file closure cache only skips the *lint* stage, never the tsc fan-out.)
//
// This module records, into the ambient recording `FileSystemView`, EVERY input
// type-check's verdict depends on, so validate-by-replay makes a change touching
// none of them an outer HIT (zero workers) while any verdict-relevant change is a
// MISS. It is purely ADDITIVE to run(): on a MISS the body runs exactly as before
// (the inner closure cache still applies); on a HIT the runner short-circuits and
// run() is never called.

/**
 * Record type-check's outer read-set into `view` (a no-op caller-side when the
 * view is null — the legacy whole-tree path). Three input sets, each mapped to a
 * recorded fact so `validate` re-derives it against the next snapshot:
 *
 *  (a) MEMBERSHIP of the type/config namespaces — glob facts over every `.ts` /
 *      `.tsx` (the lintable + tsc universe, incl. `.d.ts`) and every
 *      `tsconfig*.json`. This is the COVERAGE-GATE guard (hazard H3): a BRAND-NEW
 *      `.ts` — which the gate must FAIL if it maps to no tsconfig target — ADDS a
 *      member, so the glob match set changes → MISS → re-run → the gate fires.
 *      A content-only read-set records only files that already exist, so it would
 *      NOT see a new file and would stale-PASS the gate; the membership fact is
 *      what closes that hole. A new `tsconfig*.json` is caught the same way.
 *  (b) CONTENT of every lintable file (`graphs.files` — the SAME enumeration
 *      `buildImportGraphs`/`findLintFiles` produce and the check actually lints)
 *      as `(path, blobSha)` facts, so ANY `.ts`/`.tsx` edit is a MISS (the type
 *      graph changed) while a non-source change stays a HIT.
 *  (c) CONTENT of the global-trigger set (`findGlobalTriggerFiles` — the SAME
 *      enumeration `globalConfigFingerprint` folds: tsconfig*, package.json,
 *      bun.lock(b), *.d.ts, eslint.config.ts, plugins/**\/lint/**,
 *      *.lint.generated.ts). This is what makes a TypeScript compiler version
 *      bump (package.json / bun.lock) or a tsconfig/eslint change invalidate.
 *
 * Blob SHAs come from the snapshot the view already wraps (`recordFile` reads no
 * bytes, `glob` is a regex filter over the loaded path set) — a pure in-memory
 * projection, so recording spawns nothing and never touches tsc. This must stay
 * cheap: it runs on the MISS path, before the workers, on the same grant.

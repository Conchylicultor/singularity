// The preparation thread's entry: a Bun Worker spawned by `./prepare-thread`,
// one per type-check run. It holds that run's ONE session (`./prepare`)
// between the two requests, so everything the record phase needs from the
// prepare phase stays in this thread's memory.
//
// Every request gets exactly one reply. A throw becomes an `error` reply
// carrying this thread's stack, so a failure inside `./prepare` surfaces as the
// check's own thrown error — never as a runner waiting on a thread that died
// quietly.

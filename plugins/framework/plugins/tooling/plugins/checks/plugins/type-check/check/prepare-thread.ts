// The check runner's side of type-check's preparation thread.
//
// `./prepare` is 70–130 s of synchronous work, and the runner's thread is
// shared by every check in the pass — so it runs on a Bun Worker thread
// instead (`./prepare-worker`), and this module is all the runner holds: a
// request/reply channel to it. One thread per `run()`, holding one session in
// two phases (prepare → the runner fans out the tsc workers → finalize); see
// `./prepare` for why the session must survive between them.
//
// A Worker thread rather than a helper process, because the session carries
// `ProgramKeyContext.contentHash` across the fan-out, and a thread holds it in
// memory for free where a process would have to serialize it. Checks only
// ever run from source, so the worker is spawned by path the same way the
// per-target tsc worker is (the sentinel's compiled-release vendoring does not
// apply here).
//
// Nothing here imports `./prepare` at runtime — only its types — so the
// runner's thread never evaluates the TypeScript compiler for it.

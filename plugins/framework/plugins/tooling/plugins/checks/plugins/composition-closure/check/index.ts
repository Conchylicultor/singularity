    // points: its negative pass reads `selectedContributors` too, because a
    // locally selected plugin is a positive and positives suppress negatives. A
    // containment therefore also sees the inherited `base-exclusions` negatives
    // and shrinks by the same cascade — which keeps it agreeing with the engine

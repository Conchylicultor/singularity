/**
 * A line that names the token as an **`Accept` request header** — which is the
 * exact opposite of what this check bans. A writer says "I am SENDING a stream";
 * an `Accept` header says "I can RECEIVE one", and produces no stream at all.
 *
 * Not a hypothetical carve-out: the MCP Streamable HTTP transport REQUIRES a
 * caller to accept both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`, answering
 * 406 otherwise — unconditionally, `enableJsonResponse` included
 * (`sdk/…/webStandardStreamableHttp.js`, `handlePostRequest`). So every MCP
 * client must name the token, and without this the check would ban calling our
 * own `POST /api/mcp/:conversationId` from TS at all.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to the matched LINE and deliberately not smarter. A header
 * split across two lines still trips the check — a false POSITIVE, loud and
 * fixed by joining the line, rather than a hole a real writer could hide in.
 * Default-deny is preserved: this exempts one recognizable shape, not a path.

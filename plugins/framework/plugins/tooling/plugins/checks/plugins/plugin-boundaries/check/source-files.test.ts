/**
 * plugin-boundaries scans exactly the git-derived file set its `inputKeyed`
 * cache key represents — the pairing the old filesystem walk broke.
 *
 * The regression this pins is the one from
 * research/2026-09-09-tooling-check-file-enumeration-from-git.md: a stray `.ts`
 * under a gitignored directory inside `plugins/` was walked and scanned for
 * boundary violations, while the read-set's `view.glob("plugins/**")` — taken
 * over the git tree snapshot — could not see it. So the PASS was recorded
 * against content the key did not cover.
 *
 * The composition under test is what `run()` does: `listRepoFiles` over a real
 * throwaway git repo, then `selectSourceFiles`.
 *
 * NOTE: fixture paths go through `pj(rel)` rather than bare `plugins/<seg>/…`
 * literals — the repo's own `plugin-refs-resolve` check validates that every
 * such literal in source resolves to a real plugin, and these are synthetic.

// namespace, which a tooling/check subprocess does not have. The core barrel
// exposes exactly the config→env helpers for non-backend consumers and is

// it from the migrations plugin rather than re-typing the literal is what keeps
// this check anchored where migration generation actually runs — a drifted copy
// would glob nothing and drizzle-kit would exit 0 having found no tables.
// `drizzleGenerateArgv` comes from the same barrel and for the same reason: the
// migrations plugin owns HOW its tool is invoked as well as from WHERE. It takes
// typed flags, so this check cannot express a subcommand that would dial the
// sentinel credentials in drizzle.config.ts.
// `stageDrizzleOut` is drizzle-kit's view of data/ — the journal and the
// snapshot DAG's single tip — because drizzle-kit aborts, exit 0 and nothing
// written, on a merged history: a copy of the whole dir would pass here
// silently after every upstream update.

 * There is exactly ONE class-token walk, and it lives here.
 *
 * This check replaces `class-token-walk-in-sync`, which held six hand-copied
 * copies byte-identical. That check could only ever police the copies it knew
 * about: eleven MORE rule files carried an older, weaker copy outside its
 * `EXPECTED` list, resolved no identifiers at all, and drifted for months with
 * nothing to say so. Holding N copies in sync is a weaker property than having
 * one — so the walk moved into `tooling/plugins/lint/core/class-token-walk.ts`
 * and is injected into each rule (rule files are dual-loaded under jiti, which
 * cannot resolve `@plugins/*`, so they take the TYPE by `import type` — which
 * jiti erases — and the VALUE from `buildLintConfig`).
 *
 * What is left to enforce is an ABSENCE: no rule file may declare a walk of its
 * own. That is one grep over every rule file, rather than a byte-comparison over
 * a hardcoded list, so a new rule is covered the day it is written.

  "was pooled Postgres sockets, closed mid-query: the query hung, and on 2026-09-11 every live update " +
  "froze until main restarted. Playwright hands Chromium two extra pipe fds on every launch, and the " +
  "backend launches Chromium for prototype thumbnails and browser-fetch. Fixed upstream in " +

/**
 * The Bun this repo runs is the Bun it committed to, and that Bun does not
 * double-close a child's extra stdio fds.
 *
 * Three arms, narrowest first. The first two are bookkeeping — they keep the
 * committed lock and the running process from drifting apart, and give a failure
 * a name. The third is the actual guard: it reproduces the defect rather than
 * checking a version number, so it also catches a future Bun that regresses,
 * which no allowlist of known-good versions could.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove: only this one defect. Upstream #35931 (`Dir.close`
 * closing an fd it did not open) and #38630 (an unidentified double close in
 * the async closer) are still open, and a green run here says nothing about
 * either.

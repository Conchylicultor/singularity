 * the `@source` glob in app.css (a path relative to app.css's own location)
 * defines that scan scope. So the structural guarantee is: every file that
 * authors a utility class must lie within the resolved scan scope.
 *
 * This supersedes the older "@source must resolve to <root>/plugins" path-pin —
 * that checked one known cause (a wrong ../ depth) under one assumption (all
 * classes live under plugins/). This checks the effect directly: relocate the
 * stylesheet, add a narrower second @source, or author a className in a new
 * top-level dir, and any class left outside the scan is flagged — whatever the
 * cause. (It was a wrong ../ depth that silently narrowed the scan to
 * plugins/primitives/plugins and dropped max-w-reading from conversations/.)
 *
 * Only out-of-scope files are read, so the common (correct) case touches almost
 * no disk.

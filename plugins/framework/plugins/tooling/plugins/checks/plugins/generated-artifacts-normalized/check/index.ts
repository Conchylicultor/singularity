/**
 * The loud backstop for the generated-artifact merge contract.
 *
 * The `.gitattributes` merge drivers resolve a generated file by taking the
 * upstream side verbatim and dropping a marker; a normalize pass (the
 * `post-rewrite` hook, `push`, or a full `build`) then re-derives the canonical
 * content and consumes the marker. Every automatic path is covered — this check
 * exists for the case where none of them ran, because a surviving marker means
 * the checkout carries an artifact that does not match its own sources, and the
 * symptom of that (a `TS2307` inside a `*.generated.ts` nobody edited, or a
 * plugin registry listing a deleted plugin) points nowhere near the cause.
 *
 * It also re-asserts the one thing regeneration can NEVER fix: a conflict marker
 * left in the hand-written prose of a plugin CLAUDE.md. That assertion used to
 * live only inside push's normalize, so it was skipped entirely whenever some
 * other path did the normalizing.

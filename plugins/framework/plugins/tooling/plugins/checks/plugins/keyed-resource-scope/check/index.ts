    'Backstop for the keyed live-state resources still declared on the old spellings. A NEW collection is a `liveCollection` served with `serveCollection` (`plugins/network/plugins/live`), which derives keyed-ness, `keyOf` and the scope policy itself — never a hand-written keyed `defineResource`. What this check guards is the old keyed forms that remain (the tree resources, and the keyed resources `serveCollection` compiles to): their keyed-ness must come from a CLIENT-SHARED keyed descriptor passed to the two-arg `defineResource(descriptor, opts)`, so `keyOf` is declared once and the server can never drift from the client. It forbids the two ways keyed-ness can be smuggled into the server without a shared descriptor: (1) the flat `mode: "keyed"` form (rejected at the type level — a flat or non-keyed `mode` is only `"push" | "invalidate"`, and a keyed contract takes no `mode` at all — so any textual `mode: "keyed"` is a type bypass: `as any`, `// @ts-expect-error`, a local wrapper), and (2) an inline `keyed:` contract literal as the FIRST argument (the sanctioned form passes an imported descriptor IDENTIFIER, so `keyed:` never appears in a real call). Both let server keyed-ness drift from the client and crash the browser ("no keyOf registered for keyed resource") with no compile-time signal. See research/2026-06-21-global-keyed-resource-flat-form-elimination.md.\n\nIt also enforces (3) the second half of `ScopePolicy`: a keyed opts object declaring `identityTable` MUST declare exactly one of `membership` / `scopedMembership` / `fanOut: { reason }`. `identityTable` says which RESOURCE a change belongs to; it never said which subscribed TUPLE of it, so the feed router woke every subscribed tuple — each of which re-ran its own read, found the changed row was not its own, and diffed to empty. No frame shipped, which is exactly what hid the cost: the read IS the cost. A tuple that names ONE row is a lookup-only `liveCollection` read by id, whose `:rows` point membership routes a change only to the tuples holding that id. `tsc` enforces this at every hand-written call site (the three-arm `ScopePolicy` union); this check is the BACKSTOP for the opts objects built behind an `as … & ScopePolicy` cast, which `tsc` cannot see through. `fanOut` is the honest answer where fan-out is genuinely required (a composite pk the change feed emits no ids for; params keying a foreign column; a param-less single tuple) and normalizes to nothing at runtime — but its `reason` must be a real sentence about THAT resource. See research/2026-08-25-global-own-row-resource-scoping.md. A ROUTED opts object (`routes`, which replaces `identityTable`) must likewise declare exactly one of `membership` / `scopedMembership` — it has no `fanOut` spelling (research/2026-09-29-global-scoped-change-routing.md).',

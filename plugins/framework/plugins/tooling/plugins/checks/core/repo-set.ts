// The run's file set — what every check gets from `ctx.repo()`.
//
// Every check in a pass shares ONE JS thread, and an agent's check pass runs at
// background priority, where a blocking `readdirSync` / `existsSync` /
// `readFileSync` per file costs ~100× what it costs alone — and holds the
// thread against every other check the whole time. So the set is loaded ONCE
// per run and shared (`tooling/core`'s `RepoFiles`: membership in memory,
// content through one bounded async gate).
//
// This file adds the two things only a check run has: the cache key's own tree
// snapshot as the set's source — so a check enumerates exactly the files its
// key hashed — and read-set recording for an input-keyed check.

/**
 * `base`, with every fact an input-keyed check reads through it recorded into
 * `view`, so a PASS replayed from that read-set is exactly as fresh as what the
 * check saw. `base` must be the set over the view's own snapshot — the run's
 * `ctx.repo()` is, whenever a view exists.
 *
 * Membership is answered BY the view — the same snapshot projections `validate`
 * replays — so what is recorded and what was answered cannot differ:
 *   - `has(p)`     → `view.exists(p)`: a content fact when present, an absent
 *                    probe when not.
 *   - `under(dir)` → `view.glob("<dir>/**")`: the subtree's membership, so a
 *                    file added under it or removed from it is a MISS. The
 *                    snapshot answers that pattern with two binary searches.
 *   - `all()`      → `view.glob("**")`: the whole tree's membership.
 *   - `read(p)`    → `view.recordFile(p)`, then `base.read(p)` off the working
 *                    tree. Not `view.readFile`, which reads the blob with one
 *                    `git cat-file` spawn per call. `recordFile` takes the
 *                    blob sha from the snapshot — how grepCode, type-check and
 *                    plugin-boundaries already record bytes they read off
 *                    disk. The working tree holds the snapshot's content unless
 *                    the file changed after the run took its tree hash, the
 *                    window every disk-reading check already has.
 * The view keeps one fact per path / pattern, so a file recorded here AND by a
 * check's own eager read-set is one fact.

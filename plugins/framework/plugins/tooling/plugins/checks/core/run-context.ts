// Build-process marker for dist-comparing checks.
//
// `./singularity build` runs the check fleet IN PARALLEL with the frontend
// build and publishes the fresh dist only afterwards — so a check that compares
// the currently-DEPLOYED dist against the current tree (e.g.
// `web-artifacts:map-in-sync`) would fail exactly when the build is about to
// reconcile them: the dist it inspects is the one this very build replaces.
// Such checks skip (and must return `null` from `cacheSignature()`, so the skip
// is never recorded as a cached pass) when the marker is set.
//
// Env-based on purpose, and MORE so now than when this was written: `build` no
// longer runs checks in-process — it spawns the `check` command through
// `cli/bin/check-subprocess.ts`. The env is therefore the PROPAGATION
// mechanism, not an in-process convenience: the child inherits the marker and
// skips the same checks its parent would have, which is exactly what has to
// keep happening. A standalone check and a push-spawned one inherit no build's
// environment, so both verify the deployed dist for real.

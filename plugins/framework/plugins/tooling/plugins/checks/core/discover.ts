/**
 * The repo's ONE TypeScript program.
 *
 * There used to be a `TscTarget[]` here, discovered by scanning
 * `plugins/framework/plugins/*` for a `tsconfig.json` and adding the two
 * root-level projects (`tsconfig.tools.json`, `tsconfig.test.json`) — seven
 * programs, each spelled as a `tsc` COMMAND LINE (`dir` + `args`), which every
 * spawner then had to decode a `-p` back out of. Measured, the seven held
 * 30,649 file instances for 8,252 distinct repo files, and six of them loaded
 * the identical type environment: the split bought no type-environment
 * isolation, only 3.7 checks of the average file per cold miss. So there is one
 * program, named by its tsconfig FILE, and no list to iterate.
 * See research/2026-09-18-global-type-check-one-program.md.

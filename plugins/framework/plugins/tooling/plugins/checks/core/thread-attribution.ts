 *
 * - sync code a check runs itself keeps the check's frame on the stack
 *   (`spin ← checkRun`) — `check`;
 * - a shared async helper resumed after an `await` has LOST its caller
 *   (`spin ← helper`, no `checkRun`) — `shared`, named by the helper;
 * - module evaluation from `await import()` has no importer at all
 *   (`(module) ← evaluate ← moduleEvaluation ← requestImportModule`) — `import`.
 *
 * Anything with no source frame at all is `native` — unless a
 * `withThreadActivity` interval was running when it was taken, in which case it
 * is `activity`, named by that activity (the barrel-import lane marks each
 * import, whose load and evaluation otherwise sample as a bare

 * 1. **A frame from a check module** (anywhere on the stack, innermost first)
 *    → `check`. Beneath a runner frame or a shared helper it still wins: sync
 *    work a check started is that check's.
 * 2. **Module evaluation** → `import`, keeping the evaluated module's plugin as
 *    the detail.
 * 3. **The outermost frame with a source file** → `shared`, named by it. That is
 *    the async function that resumed, and it owns this slice. A frame IN THE
 *    REPO is preferred over a dependency's: when a library dispatches a repo
 *    callback (commander calling an action, an emitter calling a listener) the
 *    library is outermost but the callback is the work. With no repo frame, a
 *    `node_modules` frame collapses to its package name.
 * 4. **Native frames only** → `activity` when the sample was taken during one
 *    (`activity`, stamped by the sampler at sample time), else `native`, named
 *    by the leaf. Only here: a frame that names its owner always wins over an
 *    activity, which says when, not who.
 *
 * One more frame the stack can lose (measured on Bun 1.3.13): JSC
 * implements PROPER TAIL CALLS, and ES modules are strict, so a SYNC function
 * whose last act is `return heavy()` is gone from the stack while `heavy` runs.
 * A sync check body written that way hands its samples to the next frame out
 * (the runner, or whatever called it). An `async` function's `return heavy()` is
 * not a tail call, so a check's `async run()` keeps its frame; only a sync
 * wrapper returning straight into the heavy call loses it.

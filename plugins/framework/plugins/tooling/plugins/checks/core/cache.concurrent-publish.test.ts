/**
 * Concurrency contract for the cache's atomic publish.
 *
 * The regression under test: the temp file used to be named
 * `sha256(destination)`, so every process publishing the same slot picked the
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL temp path. Two builds racing over one slot then lose both ways
 * — one truncates the other's half-written bytes, and whichever renames second
 * dies on ENOENT because the first rename already consumed the temp. That
 * ENOENT propagates out of `runChecks` and aborts the build.
 *
 * This is reachable in normal operation: `CACHE_DIR` is global (deliberately, so
 * main can reuse an agent worktree's passes) and the read-set slot is keyed on
 * `(checkId, sig)` with NO treeHash, where `sig` is `""` for every input-keyed
 * check that declares no `cacheSignature()`. Two worktrees building at once over
 * a cache-cold check collide routinely.
 *
 * Uses REAL subprocesses, not in-process interleaving: the failure is a rename
 * race between OS processes, and a single-threaded simulation of it would prove
 * nothing about the fix.

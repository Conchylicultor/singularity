// Ambient scan context for a single check.run(). Carries:
//   - `tree`: the git tree-ish the cache key (treeHash) was computed from, so any
//     source scanner (grepCode) inspects EXACTLY the content the cache key
//     represents — closing the gap where computeTreeHash includes untracked
//     files (via `add -A`) but a working-tree `git grep` does not, which let a
//     PASS be recorded for content never scanned.
//   - `view`: the recording FileSystemView for an input-keyed check (null for a
//     legacy whole-tree-keyed check, which sets no read-set). When present, the
//     check's reads route through it so its read-set is captured. This is a LIVE
//     path, not a dormant one: nine checks set `inputKeyed` today (`type-check`,
//     `plugin-boundaries`, and the seven grepCode pattern checks), so recording
//     fires on every check pass.

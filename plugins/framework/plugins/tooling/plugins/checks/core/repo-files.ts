// `listRepoFiles`: the repo's file set as a plain sorted array.
//
// The listing itself is `tooling/core`'s `loadRepoFiles` — ONE implementation,
// shared with `ctx.repo()`'s fallback and with build-time codegen, which is why
// it lives below this plugin. See that file for why the set comes from git and
// never from a filesystem walk.
//
// CHECK CODE TAKES THE SET FROM `ctx.repo()` instead: the same universe, listed
// once per run for every check (off the cache key's own tree when the run has
// one), with in-memory `under`/`has`, async bounded reads, and read-set
// recording for an input-keyed check.

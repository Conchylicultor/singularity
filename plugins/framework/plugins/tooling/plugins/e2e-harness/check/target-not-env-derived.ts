/**
 * An e2e script never learns which deploy it drives from the environment.
 *
 * The defect this closes was `$SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, which answered a question
 * about a different process: the gateway set it on every backend it spawned, so
 * it meant "which namespace is this BACKEND the server for". An agent's pane was
 * spawned by main's backend and inherited the variable through the tmux server's
 * environment, so inside a worktree checkout it was always present and always
 * said `singularity`. A script that read it therefore drove MAIN's app from a
 * worktree and printed `ALL CHECKS PASSED` — it did exercise an app, just not
 * the one under test, and the transcript recorded a green run against code the
 * change was not in. That variable is gone now
 * (`research/2026-09-15-global-retire-ambient-worktree-env-runtime-identity.md`),
 * but the SHAPE it had is what this check is about, and the shape is not.
 *
 * The reads are not passive either. `withBrowser` opens by restoring the config
 * documents a previous run left changed, at the resolved origin; and the one
 * script that carried this expression, `mailbox-tabs-verify.ts`, `rmSync`s a
 * config file at the namespace it computed. Resolved to main, both of those
 * land on the user's live documents.
 *
 * The pattern is the PREFIX, deliberately, not the one variable name.
 * `SINGULARITY_E2E_BASE` had the same shape — an inherited channel that
 * silently outranks the derivation — and was deleted for the same reason, so a
 * SECOND env-shaped target must be unspellable rather than merely absent today.
 * A rule keyed on one variable name would watch the one spelling we already know
 * about.
 *
 * Scoped to `e2e/`, which is where the target comes from the deploy registry on
 * disk instead (`target.ts` → `resolveCheckoutDeploy`). The harness's own
 * `target.ts` is excluded by path: it is the file that resolves the target at
 * all, so the check is about the scripts rather than about the resolver. It
 * reads no environment variable today either — the exclusion names that single
 * file, not the harness directory, so a second file in the harness reaching for
 * one is caught like any other.

/**
 * An e2e script never learns which deploy it drives from the environment.
 *
 * `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` answers a question about a different process:
 * `gateway/worktree.go` sets it on every backend it spawns, so it means "which
 * namespace is this BACKEND the server for". An agent's pane is spawned by
 * main's backend and inherits the var through the tmux server's environment, so
 * inside a worktree checkout it is always present and always says
 * `singularity`. A script that reads it therefore drives MAIN's app from a
 * worktree and prints `ALL CHECKS PASSED` — it did exercise an app, just not
 * the one under test, and the transcript records a green run against code the
 * change was not in.
 *
 * The reads are not passive either. `withBrowser` opens by restoring the config
 * documents a previous run left changed, at the resolved origin; and the one
 * script that carried this expression, `mailbox-tabs-verify.ts`, `rmSync`s a
 * config file at the namespace it computed. Resolved to main, both of those
 * land on the user's live documents.
 *
 * The pattern is the PREFIX, deliberately, not the one variable name.
 * `SINGULARITY_E2E_BASE` had the same shape — an inherited channel that
 * silently outranks the derivation — and was deleted for the same reason, so a
 * SECOND env-shaped target must be unspellable rather than merely absent today.
 * A rule keyed on `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` would watch the one spelling we
 * already know about.
 *
 * Scoped to `e2e/`, which is where the target comes from the deploy registry on
 * disk instead (`target.ts` → `resolveCheckoutDeploy`). The harness's own
 * `target.ts` is excluded by path: it is the file that resolves the target at
 * all, so the check is about the scripts rather than about the resolver. It
 * reads no environment variable today either — the exclusion names that single
 * file, not the harness directory, so a second file in the harness reaching for
 * one is caught like any other.

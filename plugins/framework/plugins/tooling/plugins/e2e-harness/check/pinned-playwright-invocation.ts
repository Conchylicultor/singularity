/**
 * One spelling for invoking Playwright, enforced: `bun run playwright …`, never
 * `bunx playwright …` or `npx playwright …`.
 *
 * A package runner resolves the tool INDEPENDENTLY of the workspace: when the
 * package is not already installed where it looks, it fetches registry `latest`
 * — it reads neither `package.json`'s range nor `bun.lock`. Run that way,
 * `playwright install` provisions the chromium revision of whatever version it
 * happened to fetch, and registers a `.links` entry that pins that revision
 * against Playwright's own stale-browser GC. That is not hypothetical: one such
 * invocation left ~1 GB of orphaned chromium revisions in the shared cache on
 * this machine, and a revision the repo never chose is exactly what makes
 * `chromium.launch()` fail with an executable path nothing provisioned.
 *
 * `bun run playwright …` resolves the `playwright` script from the root
 * `package.json`, which resolves the workspace's own installed binary — the same
 * one every launch site loads.
 *
 * ## WHAT COUNTS AS AN OCCURRENCE — the split, and why
 *
 * The harm is a COMMAND SOMEONE RUNS, not a sentence about one. So the scan is
 * two passes with different rules, mirroring `paths:no-hardcoded-paths`:
 *
 *   - **TypeScript** goes through `grepCode` with `maskStrings: false`, which
 *     masks comments and regex literals but NOT strings. A message string is
 *     the thing an operator copies out of an error and pastes into a shell, so
 *     it counts. A comment is prose, so it does not — which is why this very
 *     docblock can name the banned spellings in full. It could not before, and
 *     the tax showed: the first person to explain the rule in a comment had to
 *     contort the sentence to get past the check.
 *
 *   - **Everything else** — markdown, JSON, TOML, shell — is scanned raw, and
 *     `research/` is excluded from both passes (historical record; rewriting it
 *     would erase the evidence for the rule). Raw because none of those formats
 *     has a comment syntax to mask, so there is no honest line to draw inside
 *     them, and because a doc is read by agents who then run what it shows.
 *     **Consequence, deliberate:** prose in a `.md` must DESCRIBE the banned
 *     spelling rather than write it. That is a real constraint on doc authors,
 *     and it is the price of covering the `CLAUDE.md` remediation strings that
 *     were half of what made this rule necessary.
 *
 * The pattern below is composed from `RUNNERS` and `TOOL` rather than written
 * out, so this file's own STRING literals — which the source pass does not mask
 * — never contain the adjacency. The check therefore cannot flag itself under
 * either pass, with no allowlist entry. An allowlist is a hole, and this check
 * having one would be the first thing copied.

/**
 * Bans Playwright's `"networkidle"` in e2e scripts. It never fires on this app:
 * the live sockets run in a SharedWorker, whose script load Playwright reports
 * as a page request but never sees finish (the response lands in the worker's
 * target), so a wait on it times out every time. `waitForNetworkIdle` (and
 * `boot()` without a marker) count requests themselves and leave that load out.
 *
 * Scoped to e2e scripts: server-side Playwright renderers of OTHER pages
 * (prototype thumbnails, browser-fetch) legitimately use it.

/**
 * Where an e2e script points its browser.
 *
 * # One URL, two components
 *
 * A run has exactly ONE target URL, and it has two halves that go to two
 * different consumers:
 *
 *     --url http://wt.localhost:9000/deploy/server/3/dep/91
 *           └────── origin ────────┘└────── path ────────┘
 *           which deploy?            which screen?
 *                   ↓                       ↓
 *           pathUrl("/api/…")          page.goto(…)
 *           builds every API call      opens the screen under test
 *
 * The origin is not a second input — it is the target URL with the path cut
 * off. There is never a run where "the origin" and "the page's origin" differ,
 * which is why there is ONE flag rather than one per half.
 *
 * This file used to hand the whole string to the half that only wanted the
 * origin. `screenshot.ts` read the same unsplit value as the page — and its own
 * usage block, and the repo's CLAUDE.md, documented `--url` WITH a path. So
 * `pathUrl("/api/config-v2/…")` resolved to
 * `<origin>/deploy/server/3/dep/91/api/config-v2/…`, which the SPA catch-all
 * answers with index.html and HTTP 200: `res.ok` passes and `res.json()` throws
 * "Failed to parse JSON". Harmless until the agent-config-write revert ledger
 * made `withBrowser` itself call the app's API on every run — after which the
 * documented `screenshot.ts` invocation could not run at all.
 *
 * The split now happens once, here, and the unsplit value never leaves this
 * module. Scripts get `pathUrl(path)` (a path the SCRIPT chose), plus
 * `pageUrl(fallback)` / `requirePage(usage)` (the path the USER chose) — so
 * there is no origin string for a script to hold, navigate to, or concatenate
 * onto.
 *
 * # The default is READ from the registry, never guessed from a name
 *
 * This exists to kill a whole class of rot by construction. Before the
 * per-plugin move, four scripts carried a *literal* ephemeral worktree host as
 * their default (`att-1781283277-ilxk.localhost:9000`, …). Those worktrees are
 * long gone, so the scripts could not run as written and nobody noticed,
 * because a default that is a dead string fails at the browser, not at the type
 * checker.
 *
 * The first fix replaced the literal with a *derivation* — the checkout's
 * directory name, preferring `$SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` — and that failed the same
 * way, one level up. A name is a guess about what somebody else registered:
 * `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` answers "which namespace is this BACKEND the server
 * for" (`gateway/worktree.go` sets it on the backends it spawns), an agent pane
 * inherits it through the tmux server, and so from inside any worktree it said
 * `singularity`. Runs drove MAIN's app and printed ALL CHECKS PASSED — worse,
 * `withBrowser` opens by POSTing the config repair to the resolved origin, so
 * every run reverted the user's live documents before doing anything.
 *
 * So the target is no longer computed at all. Every deploy RECORDS itself: the
 * build writes `~/.singularity/worktrees/<ns>/spec.json` naming the absolute
 * path of the checkout whose backend answers that namespace, and
 * `resolveCheckoutDeploy(REPO_ROOT)` reads that registry back. A checkout that
 * has published nothing resolves to nothing and the run REFUSES — which is the
 * true answer, and the one a name can never give, since a directory basename
 * always names *some* plausible host. `--composition` reaches the deploys whose
 * namespace shares no label with the checkout at all (`sonata.att-x`) — the
 * ones a basename could not name even in principle.
 *
 * No environment variable has any spelling in this runtime — not
 * `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, and not the `$SINGULARITY_E2E_BASE` that used to
 * outrank the derivation here (nothing in the repo ever set it, and an
 * inherited channel that silently wins is the shape of the bug above). There is
 * nothing left to prefer or contradict; `--url` covers every operator case and
 * is per-invocation. `e2e-harness:target-not-env-derived` keeps it that way.
 *
 * Naming the deploy is only half of it: `deploy-identity.ts` then PROVES that
 * the app answering it is the build this checkout published.

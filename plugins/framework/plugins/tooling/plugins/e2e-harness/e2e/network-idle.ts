/**
 * Network-idle as the harness measures it — Playwright's own `networkidle`
 * never fires on this app.
 *
 * The live sockets run in a SharedWorker (networking's `SharedWebSocket`).
 * Playwright reports the worker's script load as a request of the page that
 * started it, but the response lands in the worker's target, which Playwright
 * does not attach to — so the request never finishes and `networkidle` waits
 * forever. This tracker counts the page's in-flight requests itself and leaves
 * out a worker-chunk load (`isWorkerChunkPath`, the one place web-artifacts
 * emits worker scripts).
 *
 * Every page a harness session creates is tracked from its first request (the
 * session's page, and any `context.newPage()` after it); `waitForNetworkIdle`
 * refuses a page the harness never saw.

/**
 * Argv parsing for e2e scripts.
 *
 * Replaces the byte-identical `arg(name, fallback)` copy that lived in 22 of the
 * 29 scripts, plus the three divergent missing-argument endings (`exit(1)`,
 * `exit(2)`, and one that silently defaulted).
 *
 * # Both spellings, because a flag we cannot see is a flag we drop
 *
 * `--name value` and `--name=value` are the same flag. Reading only the first
 * is not a missing convenience: `indexOf("--composition")` answers "absent" to
 * `--composition=sonata`, so the run does not refuse, does not warn, and does
 * not target what it was told to — it targets this checkout's own app and
 * prints ALL CHECKS PASSED. For a *deploy selector* that is precisely the
 * silently-drove-somebody-else's-app class the target machinery exists to end,
 * reintroduced one layer below it. So the two spellings are resolved here, once,
 * for every flag rather than for the ones somebody remembered.
 *
 * `--name=` (an empty value) is a value, not an absence — it comes back as `""`,
 * which is what lets a caller be told they named a flag and gave it nothing
 * instead of silently getting the default.
 */

 * The value the caller gave `--name`, in either spelling, or `undefined`.

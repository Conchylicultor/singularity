/**
 * Pass/fail reporting for e2e scripts.
 *
 * The pre-move scripts each reimplemented a `check()` logger, in two mutually
 * incompatible shapes — `check(name, ok, detail)` (predicate) and
 * `check(label, actual, expected)` (equality) — with four different endings
 * (`process.exit(1)` on a boolean AND; a `FAILURES: n` line; a joined failure
 * array; and one script that printed mismatches and exited 0 regardless).
 *
 * The two shapes cannot be safely overloaded on arity: `check("x", true, "d")`
 * and `check("x", true, true)` are indistinguishable. So they become two named
 * methods on one object, sharing a single failure counter and a single exit path.

import { drainDiagnostics } from "./diagnostics";

/**
 * Async errors with nowhere to land, collected process-wide.
 *
 * `finish()` ends the run with an explicit `process.exit(0)` when every
 * assertion passed. That exit code WINS over the one the runtime would have set
 * on its own — so an unhandled rejection printed to stderr at second 4 was
 * followed, at second 9, by `ALL CHECKS PASSED` and exit 0. Anything that threw
 * outside the script's own `await` chain was invisible to the verdict: a route
 * handler, a listener, a detached promise in a helper.
 *
 * That is the same failure `promise-safety`'s rules exist to prevent — a script
 * that goes green while asserting nothing — so an unhandled rejection is a
 * FAILURE here, not a diagnostic. A verification script that reports success is
 * cited as evidence; it must not be able to do that with an error in flight.
 *
 * Installing a listener suppresses the runtime's own reporting, so the handler
 * prints the error itself. `uncaughtException` is deliberately NOT intercepted:
 * a listener there would keep a process running past a genuinely fatal error,
 * and an uncaught throw already fails the run loudly on its own.
 *
 * Known limit: a rejection is delivered on a later tick, so one raised after the
 * script's final `await` can still land after `finish()` has exited. Everything
 * raised during the run — which is every case this is aimed at — is caught.

 * `withBrowser` never runs at all. Today that already means `await
 * browser.close()` is skipped and those runs leak a Chromium process, despite

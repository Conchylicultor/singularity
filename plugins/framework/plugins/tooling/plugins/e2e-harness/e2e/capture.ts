 * for a SUCCESSFUL fetch whose response body is empty — a 204, or a 200 with no
 * body — while the page's `await fetch()` resolves normally. Every void endpoint
 * answers 204 (`infra/endpoints/core/implement.ts`), so without this every
 * `clientLog` flush, and every other void mutation, reads as a failed request.
 * The two cases differ synchronously: the artifact has
 * `timing().responseStart >= 0` (and `response()` resolves to the real status),
 * while a genuine abort — `AbortController`, a navigation, a close mid-flight,
 * a dial failure — has `responseStart === -1` and no response.

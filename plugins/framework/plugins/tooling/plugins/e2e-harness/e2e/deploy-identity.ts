/**
 * Proving that the app answering the target is the build this checkout made.
 *
 * `target.ts` reads WHICH namespace this checkout published; this file checks
 * that the thing on the other end of that URL is actually it. The two are
 * independent records, deliberately: `build-status.json` is written at the
 * namespace directory's root by the build that took the lock, and `.build-id`
 * is written INSIDE the dist that build published and is then served by the
 * gateway. One is what we believe, the other is what is running. A comparison
 * against the local dist would be a tautology — `spec.web` IS
 * `worktreeArtifacts.webDist(ns)`, so an fs read there and this HTTP GET
 * resolve to the same file.
 *
 * Without this, the failure it exists to catch is silent in both directions: a
 * script that drives a deploy nobody rebuilt asserts against code the checkout
 * did not produce and reports ALL CHECKS PASSED, and — because `withBrowser`
 * opens by POSTing the config repair to the resolved origin — it writes there
 * too. Green runs against the wrong app are worse than no runs, because they
 * get cited as evidence.
 *
 * # Only `ok` may refuse
 *
 * The receipt says what the last build here became, and the verdict follows it:
 *
 *   ok          this checkout published `buildId` → a mismatch THROWS
 *   running     a build is mid-flight; the dist swaps only at the very end
 *   interrupted a build died without writing a verdict
 *   failed      the build did not deploy; an earlier one is still up
 *   superseded  a later build of this same checkout took over
 *   none        a registered namespace with no receipt to compare against
 *
 * Every one of them probes, `failed` and `superseded` included: each warning
 * below names which build is actually answering, and there is no way to name it
 * without asking. (The design doc's table said "no probe" for those two — it
 * also specified the message that makes the probe necessary.)
 *
 * Everything below `ok` warns and proceeds. Refusing on `running` would open a
 * ~10-minute hard-refusal window on main every time it auto-builds on a
 * `refs/heads/main` advance — and for most of that window the dist being served
 * is still the previous, complete, correct one. Refusing on `interrupted` would
 * be worse: the root CLAUDE.md documents an interrupted build as routine (a
 * caller timeout leaves `status: running` with a dead pid), and nothing
 * rewrites the receipt until the NEXT build, so one timed-out build would block
 * every script in that checkout indefinitely. In all of those cases the
 * namespace resolution has already excluded the wrong-app class this check
 * exists for; what is left is a staleness question, and staleness is worth a
 * line on stderr, not a refusal. Warning also keeps
 * `repairAgentConfigWrites("start")` reachable — the half no teardown can
 * provide.
 *
 * # What this does NOT prove
 *
 * The served dist, not the backend. `./singularity build --no-restart` writes
 * an `ok` receipt with a new dist and leaves the previous backend running, so a
 * run can still be green against a new frontend talking to old server code.
 * Nothing here can see that; the receipt records one build id for both halves.

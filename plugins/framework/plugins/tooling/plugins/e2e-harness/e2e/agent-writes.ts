/**
 * Undoing the durable writes an e2e run made.
 *
 * Some UI state is written straight into the user's durable data: a DataView
 * writes its per-view-instance sort / filter / groupBy back through config_v2,
 * a prototype's option picker writes the shared picks record. So a script that
 * clicks "Group by Kind" to verify grouping works leaves the running surface
 * grouped for the user — and poisons its own next run's baseline, which is how
 * this was found: a "0 expanded elements" baseline became 44, the assertion saw
 * 44 → 44 and failed, and it looked exactly like a product bug.
 *
 * The server records the pre-write bytes of everything a request carrying the
 * agent-origin header overwrites, in one ledger per domain (`withBrowser` stamps
 * that header on every context, so every script and every ad-hoc
 * `screenshot.ts --click` drive is marked). This module is the harness half:
 * ask for all of it back, at both ends of every run. It names no domain — the
 * two routes aggregate every registered ledger, so a new one is covered here
 * with no change.
 *
 * Design: `research/2026-08-30-global-agent-config-write-revert-ledger.md`,
 * generalized in `research/2026-09-16-global-shared-prototype-option-picks.md`.

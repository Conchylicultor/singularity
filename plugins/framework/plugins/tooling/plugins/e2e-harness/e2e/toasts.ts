/**
 * Let the app's toasts expire before a script drives a control they cover.
 *
 * A toast lands in the bottom-right corner of the window. So does a good deal
 * of what a script clicks — a popover's submit row, a composer bar's trailing
 * pill, a floating action button. When one is on screen, Playwright refuses the
 * click with `<li data-sonner-toast> … intercepts pointer events`, and the
 * failure reads like a broken selector rather than like "something is sitting
 * on top of it".
 *
 * The nasty part is that waiting does not help: Playwright's click retry holds
 * the pointer over the toast, and hovering the stack is exactly what a toast
 * reads as "someone is reading me" — its dismiss timer stays paused for as long
 * as the retry loop runs. So the click can never succeed, and the script burns
 * its whole timeout before saying anything. This was found the hard way by
 * `tasks/launch-options`' verify script, whose run pill sits under the toast
 * stack; it lives here so the next script does not have to find it again.
 *
 * Hence the two halves: park the pointer in the far corner FIRST, which lets
 * the timer run again, then give the stack a bounded chance to drain.
 *
 * **Not an assertion.** A notification is nothing a script is testing, so this
 * never fails a run: it waits, and records a non-fatal diagnostic if the stack
 * is still there. A toast that genuinely never clears still fails loudly at the
 * click below rather than letting the run pass quietly — this only removes the
 * case where the click could not have worked and the report blamed the wrong
 * thing.
 *
 * ```ts
 * await clearToasts(page);
 * await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();
 * ```

// Generic loader for a "collected dir" registry — the build-time counterpart to
// the web/server contribution collection. Every collected runtime (facet, check,
// …) is discovered by codegen into a `<X>.generated.ts` exporting a
// `CollectedEntry[]`; this turns that entry list into validated, typed items.
//
// The caller passes the already-loaded `entries` array (not a module specifier):
// some generated registries must be imported through a non-literal specifier so
// the web bundler cannot statically follow them (see `facets/core/load-facets.ts`),
// and a relative specifier inside this leaf would resolve against the wrong module.
// This leaf has zero cross-plugin imports so `facets/core` and `checks/core` can
// both depend on it without forming an import cycle (`codegen/core`, where the
// `CollectedDir` marker lives, transitively depends on facets and so cannot).

   * motivated the option: a `cli/index.ts` that throws at load would otherwise
   * make its verb quietly absent, and `./singularity build` would report
   * "unknown command" — a broken deploy pipeline reading as a typo. `lint/` and
   * `provision/` each hand-rolled a fail-loud loader to escape this default;
   * this option exists so the CLI does not become a third copy of that, and so
   * the next fail-loud consumer has something to pass rather than something to

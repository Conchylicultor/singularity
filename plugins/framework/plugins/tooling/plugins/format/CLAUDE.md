# format

The repo's **byte-format authority**. One module decides what may be formatted,
with which options, and over which files — so the writer (`./singularity build`,
`./singularity format`) and the readers (the `*-in-sync` checks, `format-clean`)
cannot produce different bytes.

Design docs:
[`research/2026-08-06-global-prettier-auto-format.md`](../../../../../../research/2026-08-06-global-prettier-auto-format.md)
(the seam) and
[`research/2026-08-17-global-format-seam-named-arguments.md`](../../../../../../research/2026-08-17-global-format-seam-named-arguments.md)
(why its arguments are named).

## Path and content are NEVER positional

Every function here takes ONE named object — `{ file, content }`,
`{ file, before, after }` — as do codegen's `formatGenerated` / `writeGenerated`
across the seam. Hard rule for anything added, not a style preference: as two
adjacent unlabelled strings, `formatSource(source, file)` type-checked, ran no
prettier, and returned the PATH as formatted source. It destroyed 44 files
silently on 2026-08-17. `writeGenerated` needs it most — it writes, so a slip
created a file named after its own content.

The bytes are `content` everywhere (one name per concept), not `source`, which
would be false for the `.md` / `.jsonc` / `.css` this seam also carries.

## Why `core/` and not `server/`

The check runner reaches **core barrels only** (`core → core` runtime
isolation), and `format-clean` must share this exact implementation with the
build. `core/` here means runtime-neutral Node, not web-safe: it reaches
`node:fs` / `node:path` and spawns git. Never import it from `web/`.

## The allowlist is unbypassable

`FORMATTABLE_EXTENSIONS` is `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`. **Markdown must never
be added.** JSON/JSONC is deliberately deferred.

The API makes the allowlist impossible to route around: both entry points take a
**file path**, there is no `parser` parameter, and there is no content-only
entry point. So a caller cannot format a `.md` by calling it anyway.

**Two entry points, because "held out" and "garbage" must not share a return
value.** `formatSource` THROWS on a non-formattable path.
`formatIfFormattable` returns the content unchanged (without even loading
prettier), and has exactly ONE caller: codegen's `formatGenerated`, whose file
set legitimately spans `.md`, `.jsonc`, `app.css` and held-out
`*.generated.ts`. Don't reach for it elsewhere — when the pass-through was the
only behavior, a swapped argument was indistinguishable from a legitimate one.
Both also reject a `file` that cannot be a path (empty, newline, absurdly long),
which is the only rung an untyped ad-hoc script gets.

**`FORMATTABLE_EXTENSIONS` is a pure extension list; `isFormattable` is not.**
The predicate answers "will this file actually be formatted?", which is the
question both callers ask, so it additionally holds out `*.generated.ts` while
`FORMAT_GENERATED_ARTIFACTS` is `false`. Don't conflate the two.

## Generated artifacts are held out by ONE predicate

`FORMAT_GENERATED_ARTIFACTS` (currently `false`) lives here and nowhere else,
and `isFormattable` consults it. Two writers reach `*.generated.ts` — codegen's
`formatGenerated`, and the build's changed-set pass, which sees them as ordinary
changed `.ts` — so a second copy of the switch lets them disagree. The symptom
is a deterministic ping-pong: codegen writes the file, the format pass (which
runs after all codegen) rewrites it, no build is idempotent, and every
`*-in-sync` check over a generated file goes red.

Flipping it is a deliberate, isolated, revertible commit of its own: at default
width `web.generated.ts` goes 783 → 10,150 lines (design doc's open decision).
One flip covers both writers — they both consult `isFormattable`.

## Config is hardcoded, not resolved

`prettier.resolveConfig()` is never called and `.prettierignore` is not honored.
The options are a literal object of prettier's own defaults, spelled out so a
prettier upgrade that changes a default cannot silently reformat the repo. A
per-file config walk would be a way for the writer and the checkers to diverge,
and byte-identity between them is the whole point.

The root `.prettierrc` exists **only so editors agree**; its header says so. If
the two ever disagree, the options object wins and `.prettierrc` is the bug.

## The prettier import is dynamic and memoized

`let mod; mod ??= import("prettier")`. Dynamic is load-bearing, not style: a
static import hoists above every statement, so one reachable from the CLI would
resolve out of the very `node_modules` that `ensureDeps()` exists to repair —
the same hazard `cli:bootstrap-package-free` enforces against on `bin/index.ts`.
Lazy also means a build whose changed set has no `.ts` pays nothing.

The paired `format-safety/no-adhoc-prettier` lint rule bans importing or
spawning prettier anywhere else, which is what keeps that guarantee true.

## The changed set is computed once

`listChangedFormattableFiles(root)` is the single implementation. If build and
`format-clean` computed different sets, the build would format one and the check
would assert another. It is `git merge-base HEAD main` (a failure **throws** — a
manufactured fallback ref would silently format nothing), then
`git diff -M -z --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR <base>`, then
`git status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all` for the not-yet-committed
files, union, filtered by `isFormattable`, sorted.

On `main` the merge-base is HEAD, so the set is just dirty + untracked files.
That is correct: main is formatted inductively, because every branch formats its
own diff before landing.

## Coupled sets

`COUPLED_FORMAT_SETS` expresses "touching one of these drags in all of them".
The one member today is the six `no-adhoc-*` class lint rules that
[`class-token-walk-in-sync`](../checks/plugins/class-token-walk-in-sync/CLAUDE.md)
asserts carry a byte-identical copy of the shared class-token walk. All six are
currently non-conformant with prettier, so a branch touching one would format
only that one and break the byte-identity the check defends. Membership must
track that check's `EXPECTED` list.

## Writing is guarded twice

`formatChangedSources` writes **only on byte difference** (web artifacts
fingerprint on `(mtimeMs, size)`; an unconditional write would invalidate an
artifact whose bytes never changed) and **re-reads immediately before writing**,
skipping with a log line if the bytes moved since the initial read. The build
lock serializes builds, not the agent's editor — an edit landing mid-pass would
otherwise be clobbered.

## Formatting may not move a positional lint directive

`// eslint-disable-next-line R` binds to a line NUMBER, not to the code it
means; prettier reflows lines. `formatChangedSources` therefore compares each
directive's target before and after formatting and **refuses to write** a file
whose directives would change what they suppress, throwing once at the end of
the pass with every offender named.

This is the primary defense, not the paired
[`lint-directives-stable`](../checks/plugins/lint-directives-stable/CLAUDE.md)
check, and the reason is worth keeping: this is the only place in the repo that
holds a file's pre- AND post-format bytes. Write them and the evidence is gone —
a widened directive then silently suppresses violations nobody vetted, and every
later gate, that check included, is structurally green. The check is the
`push` surface (push never builds); both print the same
`formatDirectiveDisplacementReport`.

The comparison is structural: same target iff the same sequence of AST nodes
*starts* on the line — which is what ESLint actually suppresses. So quote
normalization, added trailing commas and reindentation are correctly not
displacements. Comments come from the parsed token tree, never a raw
`ts.createScanner` loop, which desyncs on regex literals and invents directives
out of `//` inside strings.

Each leaf's trivia run is scanned from **both** ends — leading *and* trailing
comment ranges. Not redundancy: `getLeadingCommentRanges` starts collecting only
after the run's first line break and `getTrailingCommentRanges` stops at it, so
leading alone silently misses every same-line directive — the braced JSX form
(~19% of the repo's) and every trailing `eslint-disable-line`.

## Failures are loud

A prettier syntax error throws, re-stamped with the path. Do not swallow and
skip: a silently skipped file lands unformatted and `format-clean` then fails at
push with no explanation. Partial progress needs no rollback — formatting is
idempotent and per-file.

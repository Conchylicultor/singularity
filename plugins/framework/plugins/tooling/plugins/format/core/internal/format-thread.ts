// The read-only formatting pass, on its own thread.
//
// `format-clean` and `lint-directives-stable` both format the branch's changed
// files inside a check pass, whose ~100 checks share ONE JS thread. Loading
// prettier is one long module evaluation, and prettier's parse + print of one
// file is one synchronous run — neither can be split by yielding, so either one
// alone could hold every other check (and every check's timeout) for seconds.
// So the formatting runs on a worker thread (`./format-worker`), and this module is
// all the calling thread holds: a request/reply channel to it.
//
// One worker per process, opened on first use and kept for the rest of it. It is
// `unref`-ed whenever no request is in flight, so an idle worker never keeps the
// process alive. Results are remembered by (file, content), so the two checks
// in one pass format each file once, and a changed file is never served a stale
// answer.
//
// The worker calls the SAME `formatSource` the build's writer calls in-process,
// so the options and allowlist cannot drift between the two. Nothing here
// imports `./prettier` at runtime, only its types — the calling thread never
// evaluates prettier for this.

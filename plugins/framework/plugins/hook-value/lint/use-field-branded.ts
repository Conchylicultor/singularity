/**
 * A `use*`-named field of a function type must be declared `Hook<…>`.
 *
 * This closes the set `hook-binding-name` enforces over. That rule can only see
 * a hook the TYPE says is one; a hook field declared as a bare
 * `useFoo: () => T` is invisible to it, so `const foo = props.useFoo` would slip
 * through. Requiring the brand wherever a hook field is declared means every
 * downstream binding inherits it — and with it the `use*` naming requirement.
 *
 * Checked: interface / type-literal property signatures (component props
 * included) whose explicit annotation has a callable member without the brand
 * (`useText: string | Hook<…>` passes; `useText: string | (() => string)` does
 * not), and every `use*` METHOD signature — a method type cannot carry the
 * brand, so the fix is converting it to a `Hook<…>` property. Function
 * declarations (`function useX`) and object literals (`vi.mock` factories) are
 * out of scope: they are values, not declared shapes.

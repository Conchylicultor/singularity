// Deferred-load signal — a tiny module-level external store that broadcasts how
// far the post-paint deferred plugin tier has progressed, and which plugins
// failed to load.
//
// WHY it exists: with deferred loading (see load-tiers.ts), a cold deep-link into
// an app paints the chrome + app shell immediately but the route's *content*
// pane may belong to a plugin that hasn't loaded yet — so the pane router finds
// no match for a beat. The layout host consumes this signal to render a loading
// placeholder for an unmatched route **while deferred loading is still in
// progress**, only falling through to not-found once loading has settled. It is
// the boot loader's one-way progress beacon; the UX that reads it lives in the
// layout host plugin.
//
// A failed load is not just "settled": its plugin path is tracked in
// `failedPluginPaths` so a consumer can tell "route not resolvable yet" from
// "route's plugin chunk failed to load" (`hasLoadErrorUnder(prefix)`) and render
// an error surface instead of falling through to not-found. Each failure also
// fires `pluginLoadReportSink` so the reports plugin can file a crash task.
//
// App.tsx (the boot sequencer) is the sole writer: it calls
// `markDeferredPluginsLoaded` after each batch appends, `markDeferredPluginsFailed`
// for that batch's load errors, and `markDeferredLoadComplete` once every
// deferred entry has loaded or failed (a failed load still counts as settled so
// the placeholder can resolve to not-found / error instead of spinning forever).

// (it runs on the boot error path). Kept here — not wired to the `report-sink`
// primitive — on purpose: web-sdk is the base framework layer and must not depend
// on a `primitives/` plugin, and `report-sink`'s own web barrel imports web-sdk,
// so importing its core would form a plugin-level import cycle. This is the same

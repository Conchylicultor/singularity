// Load-tier partition — the pure function that splits the web plugin registry
// into the **eager substrate** (chrome, providers, boot tasks, every app's
// shell) and the **deferred app content** loaded after first paint.
//
// The whole point (see
// research/2026-07-02-cold-deeplink-boot-saturation-deferred-loading.md): the
// boot effect used to `loadPlugins(webEntries)` over all ~643 chunks before it
// could paint or even construct the notifications socket — ~8s of route-
// independent main-thread saturation. Deferring app *content* (which only ever
// renders inside its own app surface) shrinks the eager set to what the chrome
// actually needs, so the socket + first paint land seconds sooner.
//
// The tiers are DERIVED, not hand-listed. `web-tiers.generated.ts` (produced by
// `codegen/core/eager-tier-gen.ts`) is the committed source of truth: a plugin
// is EAGER iff it is non-app-content / a shell subtree (structural), calls a
// watched boot slot (Core.Root / Core.Boot / Apps.App / ActionBar.Item), owns a
// bootCritical resource descriptor, or is pulled in by the transitive dependsOn
// closure of any of those. Every app is deferrable by default; the historical
// hand-maintained allowlists (DEFERRABLE_APPS / EAGER_EXCEPTIONS) are gone.
//
// Fail-safe direction: the generated artifact is the DEFERRED set, so an unknown
// path is treated as EAGER — a modeling gap only makes a plugin needlessly eager
// (slower boot), never wrongly deferred. The `eager-tier-in-sync` check fails on
// drift, and a bootCritical descriptor whose owner has no web entry fails
// generation outright (the reachability guard). The rule stays a pure function of
// `pluginPath` — trivially unit-testable (see load-tiers.test.ts) and leaving the
// concatenated `webEntries` as the single source of truth (the partition is
// derived, so `--composition` builds and the plugin-load smoke test are unaffected).

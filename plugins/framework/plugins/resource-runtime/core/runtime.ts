//
// This is the single, parameterized implementation behind both the per-worktree
// server runtime (@plugins/framework/plugins/server-core/core) and the central
// runtime (@plugins/framework/plugins/central-core/core). Each facade calls
// `createResourceRuntime(opts)` with its runtime-specific hooks; the ~42
// `defineResource` call sites and ~37 `Resource.Declare` contributors are
// unaffected because the facades re-present this runtime's types and bind its
// returned values.
//
// A plugin calls defineResource({key, loader, schema, mode}). The host exposes:
//   GET /api/resources/:key (or /api/central-resources/:key) — HTTP fallback
//   WS  /ws/notifications  (or /ws/central-notifications)     — single push channel
// and broadcasts updates when the plugin calls resource.notify().
//
// The runtime is acyclic: besides `zod` and `bun` (ServerWebSocket type) it
// imports only the `packages/…` leaves (globally-allowed utility code, so no
// cycle — inflight for read-path single-flight coalescing, semaphore for the
// read-admission gate, zod-parser for the `ZodParser` alias). It declares
// its own local WsData/WsHandler interfaces
// (byte-identical to server-core/central-core's types.ts) rather than importing
// them — importing from either facade would create a cycle. The returned
// `notificationsWsHandler` is structurally assignable to each facade's WsHandler.

  // NEVER coalesce: a plain subscriber must not attach to a partial load (torn
  // snapshot), and two scoped loads with different affectedIds are not the same
  // work. They run the refill directly, and never carry an ETag — a partial value
  // is not a snapshot any signature describes.
  //
  // THE VALUE AND ITS ETAG ARE CO-PRODUCED BY ONE FLIGHT. `seedEtag` is the
  // signature the CALLER probed before asking for the value; the resolved `etag`
  // is the signature the flight that actually produced the value was seeded with.
  // For the STARTER they are the same string. For a JOINER they differ: joiners
  // receive the starter's object and therefore **adopt the starter's seed,
  // discarding their own**. That discard is the whole point.
  //
  // Without it: two `handleSub`s probe their own signatures either side of a
  // change (starter reads S1, joiner reads S2), coalesce onto ONE loader run whose
  // value is the S1 snapshot, and the joiner stamps `(V@S1, S2)` on its sub-ack.
  // Its next revalidation sends S2, the server recomputes S2 from unchanged state
  // and answers `up-to-date`/`304` — and for an `invalidate`-mode resource, whose
  // pushes carry no value, nothing ever heals it. The client holds the stale value
  // FOREVER. Adopting the starter's older seed inverts the error into the safe
  // direction: an ETag describing a snapshot older than its value costs one
  // needless recompute on the next revalidation, and can never serve stale.
  //
  // A flight started by a caller with no seed (push path, `loadResourceByKey`)
  // resolves `etag: undefined`, and every joiner adopts that too — see `handleSub`.
  //
  // THE WATERMARK IS CO-PRODUCED BY THE SAME FLIGHT (Rule B′ — the causal twin of
  // the etag co-production above). The STARTER captures the commit watermark
  // (`opts.captureWatermark`, xid8 xmin) BEFORE `timedLoad`, so it is a valid
  // floor for the value the flight produces: any commit invisible to the loader's
  // snapshot has xid >= it (Rule B). Joiners adopt the starter's whole
  // `{value, etag, watermark}` — a watermark newer than the value it rides with
  // is structurally excluded, exactly like the etag seed adoption. No hook
  // (central runtime) or a throwing hook ⇒ `undefined`: the frame ships
  // tokenless and the optimistic client degrades to content-only confirmation —
  // never a wrong causal denial. A SCOPED load (ctx) is a partial re-read of
  // only the affected rows, so it NEVER carries a watermark: stamping one would
  // let a client treat a partial value as full server truth at that floor.
  // THE ackTx IS CO-PRODUCED BY THE SAME FLIGHT (the third co-production, after
  // the etag and the watermark). `seedAckTx` is the pending's source-transaction
  // ids the CALLER (a feed-driven drain) wants stamped on the frames this value
  // feeds; the resolved `ackTx` is the seed of the flight that ACTUALLY produced
  // the value. A caller that JOINS a flight adopts the starter's (typically
  // undefined) seed and ships NO ackTx — a missed ack degrades to the client's
  // watermark backstop, while stamping its own seed on someone else's value
  // would be a FALSE ack (the one soundness hazard the co-production closes).
  // The FULL drains additionally pass `notBefore` (below), so they no longer
  // join a pre-commit flight at all and in practice stamp their own set.
  // Read-path callers (sub-ack / HTTP / loadResourceByKey) never seed and never
  // stamp ackTx (their snapshot watermark subsumes it). A SCOPED (ctx) load
  // never coalesces (ctx loads bypass the inflight), so returning the seed
  // directly is safe.
  //
  // THE VERSION IS *NOT* CO-PRODUCED — WHICH IS WHY `notBefore` EXISTS. A push
  // drain assigns `version = current + 1` BEFORE it asks for the value, and that
  // number is an assertion: "this is the state as of the change I am draining".
  // Nothing about joining a flight can make an older SELECT satisfy it — so the
  // defence cannot be adoption, it has to be REFUSAL. `notBefore` is the caller's
  // freshness floor (the drain passes `pendingEntry.lastNotifyAt`): a flight that
  // STARTED before it is superseded rather than joined, and this call starts its
  // own. Passing nothing keeps the plain deduplicator, which is what every READ
  // caller wants — a read frame only ever *reports* a version it observed before
  // the load, so a joined older value can only report an older version, which the
  // client already drops. Never key this off `gated`: the boot-snapshot fan-out
  // and the multi-tab sub herd are read callers that MUST keep coalescing.
  // Without it, the 2026-08-08 incident: a drain joined a flight whose SELECT
  // predated the very commit that triggered it, and broadcast the pre-commit
  // rows at the fresh version. The client's only guard is numeric, so it applied
  // them — and since the pending had already been cleared, nothing re-read.
  // See research/2026-08-08-global-live-state-flight-freshness.md.
  //
  // THE BASE VERSION IS CO-PRODUCED TOO (the fourth): the tuple's version when
  // the flight's read STARTED, read in the starter's factory. A sub-ack re-seeds
  // the keyed snapshot only while the version still equals it — i.e. no push
  // advanced the snapshot since this value's read began. The version the

  // started before a push observes the pushed version and would re-seed the

  // A paged read splits and merges its pages, and each new page's rows are —
  // wholly or partly — a slice of pages the client and this server already
  // hold (research/2026-10-09-global-live-key-range-pages-v2.md §4.4). So a
  // fresh `sub` may carry `derive: { id, from: DeriveSource[] }`, and when every
  // source is QUIESCENT at the version the client sliced and the slices are
  // complete for the new range, the new tuple's snapshot is copied from them —
  // no load, and a `sub-ack` with no value: the client adopts the slice it
  // holds. Otherwise the sub falls back to today's full load; the client takes
  // either answer.
  //
  // Why the copy is the new tuple's truth: a quiescent source (subscribed, a
  // snapshot of its own span, no pending, not draining, its version the one
  // the client sliced) holds every change routed to it so far — and the client
  // holds exactly that snapshot at that version. Every change routed from the
  // registration on reaches the new tuple too (`handleSub` derives in the same
  // synchronous step as it registers), and drains against the copy. A window
  // is a prefix of its range, so a slice ending at a row of it is complete up
  // to that row; one through its end only when the source is not full. The
  // rows the new tuple's range holds beyond the slices are the client's claim
  // (the cuts it encoded in the new params): the runtime is key-agnostic and
  // cannot check a range, only that the slices fit the window (`limitOf`).
  //
  // Only a bounded window that states its `familyOf`: never
  // persisted, so no base floor to carry (an L2 floor must describe a FULL
  // read, which nothing here did), and the hash encoder on both sides. The
  // order signatures are copied with the rows, which holds only within one
  // query, whose tuples order alike — so every source must be of the new
  // tuple's family (`familyOf`), checked here rather than trusted.

    // real update isn't stale-dropped. This is the herd cure: a resubscribe for an
    // unchanged resource costs one cheap signature, not a full loader.
    //
    // THE INVARIANT: the ETag and the value must be produced by the SAME FLIGHT
    // over the same snapshot. An ETag may describe a snapshot OLDER than the value
    // it accompanies (costing one needless recompute on the next revalidation); it
    // must NEVER describe a newer one — that serves the stale value forever, since
    // the client's next revalidation matches the ETag, is answered
    // `up-to-date`/`304`, and an `invalidate`-mode push carries no value to heal it.

    // Two mechanisms would break it, and both are closed here:
    //
    // 1. ORDERING. Computed AFTER the value, a change landing in between would ship
    //    a stale value stamped with an already-current ETag. So `computeEtag` runs
    //    FIRST, and any post-value change advances the ETag, forcing a real refetch.
    //    Still load-bearing — do not reorder.
    //
    // 2. COALESCING. Ordering alone is only sufficient if reading the value at time
    //    T yields the state at T. It does not when the flight COALESCES: two
    //    `handleSub`s that probed their own signatures either side of a change share
    //    one loader run, so the joiner holds the starter's older value while its own
    //    `freshEtag` names the newer state. So `freshEtag` is passed to `gatedRead`
    //    as a SEED and the flight hands back the etag it was actually seeded with
    //    (see `getResourceValue`). We stamp THAT — never `freshEtag` directly.
    //
    // `freshEtag` remains the right operand for the `up-to-date` short-circuit
    // below: that comparison is against THIS subscriber's `clientEtag` and asks
    // only "is your cached snapshot still current?", which no flight participates

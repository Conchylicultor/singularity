/**
 * The shared routed fixture: a keyed resource declared the way a compiled
 * collection is — a minted identity route plus a membership — and a change
 * delivered the way the change feed delivers it. A keyed entry is always a
 * routed membership entry (keyed ⇒ membership ⇒ routed, a registration throw),
 * so every suite that needs "a keyed resource over a simulated table" builds it
 * here rather than hand-rolling a plan and a feed per file.
 *
 *   - `identityPlan(table, cols)` — the plan `compileWindowQuery` emits for a
 *     single-table collection: one identity route on the base table, read by
 *     every tuple as membership.
 *   - `defineRoutedTable(h, spec)` — register a keyed resource on that plan with
 *     an `alias` (unbounded window), `window` or `point` membership, and get
 *     back its handle and a `feed` for its table.
 *   - `feedChange(h, change)` — one base-table change, to the routed router and
 *     then the legacy one (`routeChange` in the change feed): every entry is
 *     served by exactly one of them.
 *   - `legacyFull(h, table, o)` — the legacy router alone: every non-routed
 *     reader of `table` recomputes FULL.
 *
 * A routed entry is reached ONLY through its routes, so a `readSet` the harness
 * answers for its key would be a dead option a migrated suite carried over from
 * the legacy router: `defineRoutedTable` refuses it.

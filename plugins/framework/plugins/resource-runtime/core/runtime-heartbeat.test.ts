/**
 * The heartbeat ping carries `flushOpenMs` — how long the running flush pass has
 * been open (0 when idle). Run with
 * `./singularity test plugins/framework/plugins/resource-runtime`.
 *
 * The 2026-09-11 incident: a DB socket was closed under a query inside a flush,
 * the query's promise never settled, and — flushes being single-active — every
 * later push queued behind it for 25 minutes. The pings kept flowing, so the tab
 * saw a healthy, quiet socket. The ping is the one frame that still reaches the
 * tab while pushes are stuck, so it reports the stall; the Connection row of the
 * health report turns it into "live updates have been stuck for N min".
 * `research/2026-09-11-global-live-updates-frozen-by-stray-fd-close.md`.
 *
 * The heartbeat interval and the clock are both captured, not waited on: the
 * interval's callback is taken off a `setInterval` spy when a probe socket opens,
 * and `performance.now()` is a hand-advanced fake.

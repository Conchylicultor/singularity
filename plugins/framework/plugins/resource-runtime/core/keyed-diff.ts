// counterpart to the client `mergeKeyedDelta` consumer in
// `@plugins/primitives/plugins/live-state/web/keyed-delta-merge.ts` — is named,
// isolated, and fuzzable without standing up a socket or a registry.
//
// A keyed-mode array resource keeps a per-`(key,params)` snapshot of
// id→`SnapEntry` (a content identity over the row's canonical JSON — see
// `SnapEncoder` — computed identically on every path). On a notify the runtime
// re-runs the loader, diffs the new array against that snapshot by row id, and
// broadcasts only the changed rows + the id order — so a single-row change
// ships one row instead of the whole list. This module owns that diff. The
// runtime owns the snapshot *storage* (the `Map<pk, snapshot>`) AND the
// per-resource encoder choice: these functions take the prior snapshot + the
// encoder in and hand the next snapshot back, staying pure (no I/O, no
// mutation of their inputs). A resource's `prev` snapshots must have been
// built with the SAME encoder passed to the diff (entries are compared for
// equality) — the runtime guarantees this by deriving the encoder statically
// from the resource definition.

/**
 * One retained snapshot entry for a row: either the row's full canonical JSON
 * (`string`) or a 64-bit content hash of it (`bigint`). Which one an entry
 * stores is a PER-RESOURCE choice made once by the runtime (`SnapEncoder`
 * below) — the two never mix within one resource's snapshots.

 *
 * - `hashSnapEncoder` (the default for keyed resources): retain a 64-bit
 *   wyhash instead of the full JSON string. A snapshot Map shrinks from
 *   value-sized (UTF-16 ⇒ ~2 B/char of row JSON, rebuilt and dropped on every
 *   recompute — the delivery-path GC sawtooth) to ~16 B/row. The trade,
 *   explicit: a 64-bit collision makes a genuinely-changed row read as
 *   unchanged — a missed update no self-heal path catches (the diff sees no
 *   change, so no frame and no flushAgain). Birthday-bounded: for a pk with
 *   n rows the probability of ANY collision is ~n²/2⁶⁵ (n=10⁵ ⇒ ~3·10⁻¹⁰);
 *   the length fold below additionally kills every different-length collision.
 * - `retainSnapEncoder`: keep the canonical JSON string — REQUIRED for
 *   `scopedMembership` resources, whose persisted-incremental path

 *   (`runtime.ts` drainMembershipScoped). Behavior identical to the

 * re-selected — so this both merges those rows in AND resolves membership
 * exits/entries against `prev`, returning a delta that MAY assert `order`
 * (unlike `diffKeyedScoped`, which never does). Pure — never mutates `prev`.
 *
 * Wire contract (see `keyed-delta-merge.ts`): the client rebuilds the keyed array
 * PURELY from `order`, so any membership change MUST ship the full `order`; and an
 * `order` id resolvable from neither the `upserts` nor the client's base forces a
 * drift-resub. Both are honored here — `nextSnapshot` is rebuilt FROM `order` so
 * snapshot ≡ wire order, and `upserts`/`order` are sanitized to the surviving ids.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Merge `refillRows` into a copy of `prev`; a changed/new row is an upsert.
 *   2. Exits = ids in (`requestedIds` ∪ `deletedIds`) that are in `prev` but were
 *      NOT returned by the refill → removed from the snapshot, listed in `deletes`.
 *   3. Entries = refill ids absent from `prev`. No entries AND no exits ⇒ Case A:
 *      `{ upserts, deletes: [], order: undefined }` — the exact `diffKeyedScoped`
 *      shape (in-place upserts, membership/order unchanged).
 *   4. Otherwise membership changed. The order SOURCE is `orderedIds` when
 *      supplied (an entry happened), else the prior snapshot order (exit-only).
 *      `finalOrder = orderSource.filter(id => merged.has(id))` drops ids the order
 *      source no longer agrees on (an `orderedIds` id absent from the merge, or a
 *      merged id concurrently deleted out of `orderedIds`); `nextSnapshot` is

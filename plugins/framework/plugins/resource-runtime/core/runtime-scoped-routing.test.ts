/**
 * Scoped-vs-FULL routing-table gaps. Run with
 * `bun test plugins/framework/plugins/resource-runtime/core/runtime-scoped-routing.test.ts`.
 *
 * The scoped-recompute routing table decides, per resource per flush, whether a
 * change recomputes only the affected rows (`ctx.affectedIds`, a `WHERE id IN (…)`
 * scoped load) or the whole view (`ctx === undefined`, FULL). This file pins the
 * COALESCING corners that `mergePending` (`runtime.ts:1087`) and `drainEntry`
 * (`runtime.ts:1544`) own within a single flush:
 *
 *   - sticky-FULL absorption (both orders): an id-less contributor in the same
 *     flush sticks the pk at FULL (`mergePending` null-absorption, `runtime.ts:1103`).
 *   - scoped∪scoped union: two scoped changes coalesce their id sets.
 *
 * The entry is a routed alias (its identity route), the shape every scoped
 * change reaches since the legacy router went FULL-only (P8 steps 23–24, 23a).

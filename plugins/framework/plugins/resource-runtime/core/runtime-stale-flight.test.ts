/**
 * Flight freshness — a push may not be served by a read that began before the
 * change it is announcing. Run with
 * `bun test plugins/framework/plugins/resource-runtime/core/runtime-stale-flight.test.ts`.
 *
 * The 2026-08-08 incident: a page's freshly typed blocks vanished for ten minutes
 * under load. A push drain assigned `version = current + 1` and then COALESCED
 * onto a read flight already in the air — whose SELECT had run before the commit
 * the drain was announcing — and broadcast those pre-commit rows under the fresh
 * version. The client's only guard is numeric (`version <= entry.version` ⇒ drop),
 * so it applied them; and because the drain had already cleared its pending, no
 * path ever re-read. See
 * `research/2026-08-08-global-live-state-flight-freshness.md`.
 *
 * The fix is REFUSAL, not adoption: the version is the one stamp that cannot be
 * co-produced (it is minted before the read), so the drain passes its pending's
 * `lastNotifyAt` as `inflight`'s `notBefore` and a flight older than that is
 * superseded rather than joined. Read callers pass no floor, so the read path's
 * coalescing — and the gate-after-dedup replay-storm fix riding on it — is
 * untouched.
 *
 * EVERY test here uses `snapshotControllable`, never `controllable`. That is not
 * style: `controllable` resolves at release time, so a pre-commit and a
 * post-commit flight return the same value and the buggy runtime is
 * indistinguishable from the fixed one. That is precisely why
 * `runtime-ack-channel.test.ts` staged this exact race for months and read as
 * green.

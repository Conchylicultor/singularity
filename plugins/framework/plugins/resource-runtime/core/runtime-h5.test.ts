/**
 * H5 — the notify-vs-fresh-sub race. Run with
 * `bun test plugins/framework/plugins/resource-runtime/core/runtime-h5.test.ts`.
 *
 * `research/2026-04-15-global-sse-lifecycle-mental-model-v3.md` §9 (H5) prescribes
 * "test by racing a `notify()` against a fresh `sub` in a unit test". A fresh
 * subscription reads its sub-ack version up front (a read never bumps —
 * `runtime.ts:1952`) and then parks on the loader; meanwhile a concurrent push
 * bumps the version and ships a newer frame. The invariant the client leans on:
 * the stale sub-ack (older version) can NEVER overwrite the newer push, because
 * the WS version guard applies a frame iff `frame.version > entry.version`
 * (`notifications-client.ts:862`). These tests drive the recorded frames through
 * the real client simulator (`makeClientView`) and assert it converges to server
 * truth — not merely that a frame of the right shape was sent.
 *
 * These races no longer COALESCE, and the file's old argument rested on the fact
 * that they did. Since `research/2026-08-08-global-live-state-flight-freshness.md`
 * a push drain passes a freshness floor (`notBefore: lastNotifyAt`) into the
 * single-flight, so a read flight that started before the notify is SUPERSEDED,
 * not joined: H5a and H5c each run the FULL loader TWICE and fire the runtime's
 * `onStaleFlightSupersede` hook once. They stay green — and the reasons are
 * recorded per test, because "still green" was never the interesting part. The
 * bug that incident was about hid inside a suite that was green for a reason that
 * had stopped being true.
 *
 * What survives unchanged: `handleSub` yields one explicit microtask after its
 * flight resolves while `sendUpdate` sends synchronously (see
 * `resource-runtime/CLAUDE.md`), so the push still reaches the wire before the
 * stale sub-ack in this harness. That is an ordering these tests OBSERVE, not an
 * invariant the wire depends on — with two independent flights, real completion
 * order is unrelated — and every convergence assertion below holds in either
 * order, because the client's version guard, not the send order, is what makes the
 * stale sub-ack harmless.

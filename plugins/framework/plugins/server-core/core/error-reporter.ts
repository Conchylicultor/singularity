 * that matters here: `reportServerError` hands its report to an ASYNC durable
 * path (a Postgres write), and the event loop a dying process has left cannot
 * run one. So this pair's contract is **synchronous, and durable before it
 * returns** — the implementation writes to disk and the next boot flushes it.
 *
 * It carries a `kind` because, unlike a caught error, the thing being reported
 * is not a crash: it is a named condition the caller decided to exit on, and the
 * kind is what lets the next boot render it as itself rather than as an
 * anonymous stack.

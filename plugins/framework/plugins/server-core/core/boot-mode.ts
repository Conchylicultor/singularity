// backend) or `exec` (a short-lived child that runs one registered piece of
// work and exits). See `../shared/boot-stages.ts` for the split.
//
// Both modes run the same `register` and `onReadyBlocking` phases, so a plugin
// whose hook in one of those phases makes a claim about the SERVING backend
// must ask. The case that forced this: boot-events wrote its `start` line from
// `register`, but its `ready` line from `onReady`, which exec skips — so every
// nightly backup child left an unpaired `start` in main's boot channel, and the
// boot watchdog reported main as wedged for as long as main then stayed up.
//
// Set once, by the shared boot sequence, before any plugin module loads — so
// every phase hook can read it, and a read before boot throws rather than
// guessing.

// `../shared/boot-stages.ts` awaits each token before the next), so "the plugin
// being registered" is a single well-defined value for the whole of a
// `Registration.register()` call — including an async one that awaits inner
// tokens (a wrapper registering the job it wraps). A registry records it so it
// can later say WHERE an entry was declared (the Background activity page's
// "Declared in"), without every factory taking the plugin id as an argument it
// could get wrong.
//
// `null` outside the register phase: a token registered by hand (a test calling
// `job.register()` directly) was declared by no plugin the framework knows of.

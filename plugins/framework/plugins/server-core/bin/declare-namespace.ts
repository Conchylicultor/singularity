// ── The FIRST thing a backend does: say which namespace it is ────────────────
//
// Imported as the literal first statement of `bin/index.ts`, before the
// `server-core/core` barrel — so it runs before `./active-runtime` reaches
// `plugins-active.ts` (whose top level selects the registry) and before
// `config_v2/server/internal/config-dir.ts`, which resolves its directory at
// module eval and throws without an identity.
//
// The value arrives on ARGV, from the one process that knows it: the gateway
// spawns `… bin/index.ts --namespace <ns>` (`gateway/worktree.go`). It used to
// arrive as `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` in the environment, and an environment
// variable reaches every descendant forever — which is how agent shells, and
// every `build` / `check` / `test` they ran, came to believe they were main.

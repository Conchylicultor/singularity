// Both boot modes need exactly these two answers, so they are stated once here
// rather than in each composition root:
//
// - `serve` (`./index.ts`) imports this statically.
// - `exec` (`../cli/run-exec.ts`) imports it DYNAMICALLY, so that a command
//   declaration reaching the exec barrel keeps a trivial static closure (the
//   `cli:command-declarations-light` check stops at dynamic-import edges).
//
// It lives under `bin/` — beside the three files that already answer "which app
// is this backend" (`plugins-active`, `select-registry`, `spec-composition`) —
// and NOT under `shared/`, because `PLUGINS_DIR` comes from `paths/core` while
// `paths/server` imports this plugin's `core`: a `shared/`-tagged edge to
// `paths` would close a cycle in the server import graph. `bin/` and `cli/`
// edges sit outside that graph, so both consumers can reach it from here.

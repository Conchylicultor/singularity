/**
 * Read WHICH APP this backend is, off the same `spec.json` the gateway read to
 * spawn it.
 *
 * The spec is the one durable statement of a namespace's identity
 * (`infra/worktree/server/internal/spec.ts` writes it, and its `composition`
 * field is documented there). This is the read side, kept here rather than
 * behind that plugin's barrel because it runs before any plugin is loaded and
 * that barrel's closure is the whole worktree/git stack. The FILENAME still
 * comes from one place — `WORKTREE_SPEC_FILE` in `infra/paths`, whose barrel is
 * free here: `bin/index.ts` already imports it, so nothing is added to the boot
 * import closure.
 *
 * **Why the file and not an env var.** The first cut had the gateway pass
 * `SINGULARITY_COMPOSITION` to the backend it spawns. But `./singularity build`
 * rebuilds the backend and NOT the Go gateway (only `./singularity start`
 * compiles that), so a running gateway is routinely older than the tree it
 * serves — it would not pass the variable at all, the backend would see no
 * composition, and it would boot the FULL app under a composition's own
 * namespace and database. Which is exactly the failure the composition field
 * exists to remove. Reading the file directly deletes the hop that can drop the
 * value: the gateway and the backend read the same bytes, so they cannot drift.
 *
 * Four ways to get "no composition", all of them the main app, which is what an
 * absent value has always meant:
 *
 *   1. No `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` — a hand-run backend, spawned by nobody.
 *   2. No spec file — not gateway-spawned, or a namespace not registered yet.
 *   3. A spec with no `composition` key — every pre-composition spec, and
 *      `central`, which serves no composition at all.
 *   4. An empty `composition` — handed straight through; `selectRegistry`
 *      already reads `""` as the main app.
 *
 * A spec that EXISTS but cannot be read or parsed is not one of them. That is a
 * corrupt contract, and it throws for the same reason `selectRegistry`'s second
 * arm throws: booting the wrong app under a namespace looks like it worked.
 *
 * @param worktreesDir the `worktrees` data dir holding `<namespace>/spec.json`
 *   — passed in rather than resolved here so this stays a pure function of
 *   (dir, namespace) with a tmpdir test, exactly like `selectRegistry`
 * @param namespace the raw `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` value, which is the spec dir
 *   basename. Not validated here: `selectRegistry` owns that guard, and a
 *   namespace bogus enough to escape the dir simply names no spec file.

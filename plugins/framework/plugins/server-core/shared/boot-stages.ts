// ── The boot sequence, once, for both boot MODES ────────────────────────────
//
// A backend process boots in one of two modes, and they share this file so they
// cannot drift:
//
// - `serve` — the gateway-spawned, long-lived backend (`../bin/index.ts`). Runs
//   every phase: this file's sequence, plus the socket bind interleaved into it
//   and the post-serving phases (`onReady`, `onAllReady`, `drainWarmups`) after
//   it.
// - `exec` — a short-lived process that runs ONE registered piece of work and
//   exits (`../cli/run-exec.ts`). Runs the sequence in this file and nothing else.
//
// The mode split is stated as a discriminated union (`BootSpec`) rather than a
// boolean, so the one phase that differs INSIDE the sequence — serve binding its
// socket between contribution collection and the ready barrier — is spellable
// only by `serve`. See `../cli/run-exec.ts` for what `exec` skips and why each
// skipped phase would be wrong in a short-lived process.
//
// A SECOND COPY of this sequence is the failure mode this file exists to
// prevent: a recovery/secondary path that nothing exercises until something has
// already gone wrong is the path that rots (see
// research/2026-09-01-global-supervised-run-survives-restart.md). Add a phase
// here, not in one of the two composition roots, unless it is genuinely
// serve-only.
//
// WHY `shared/` AND NOT `core/`: `core/` is this plugin's public API, and its
// barrel is imported by nearly every server plugin — putting the boot sequence
// behind it makes the plugin loader, the registry and `paths/core`'s
// module-scope `homedir()` statically reachable from a barrel a web file is
// allowed to import (measured: +20.7 KB of static graph, reaching
// `server.generated.ts` and `plugins-active`). `shared/` is this plugin's
// private DRY between its own runtimes, and R10 forbids cross-plugin `shared/`
// imports — so the sequence structurally cannot leak. `bin/` was not an option
// either: nothing may import INTO a `bin/` path from another plugin (R4 admits
// only runtime barrels), which is why the `exec` entry itself sits in `cli/`.

/**

//   registry) behind a green `/api/health/ready`. A plugin whose blocking work is
//   genuinely optional-for-correctness must make that explicit by handling its own
//   failure INSIDE the hook (see `live-state-snapshot`), never by relying on the
//   framework to swallow it.

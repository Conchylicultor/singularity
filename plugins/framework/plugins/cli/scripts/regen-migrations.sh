# `regen-migrations` (reset branch-local files + re-run drizzle-kit generate
# against the rebased schema). Marker names are owned by MERGE_MARKER_KINDS in
# ../core/internal/merge-markers.ts.
# Without a conflict, the marker isn't dropped and we skip the wasteful regen.
# Resolve the marker dir exactly as regen-generated.sh does — read its comment
# there for why the ambient GIT_* pointers are unset first and why an
# unresolvable git dir is fatal instead of a skipped marker.

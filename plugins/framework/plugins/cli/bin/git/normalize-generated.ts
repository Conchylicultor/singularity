/**
 * Re-derive canonical content for every generated artifact a merge driver
 * auto-resolved, and fold the result into the head commit.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: the `.gitattributes` drivers (`scripts/regen-*.sh`) resolve a
 * generated file by taking the UPSTREAM side verbatim — a knowingly-wrong tree
 * that is cheap to produce and trivially repairable, because the file is a pure
 * function of sources that git just merged correctly. Each driver records that
 * it fired by dropping a marker; this function is the repair the markers exist
 * to trigger.
 *
 * WHO CALLS IT: `push` (before and after its own rebase) and the
 * `post-rewrite` git hook (after ANY other rebase / amend). The hook is what
 * makes the repair independent of which command drove the rebase — a manual
 * `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` self-heals exactly like a
 * push does. `build` reaches the same end state by regenerating everything
 * unconditionally, and clears the markers itself.
 *
 * WHY `force` EXISTS: zero markers used to mean "the merge was clean, there is
 * nothing to repair" and returned immediately. But it is indistinguishable from
 * "a marker was dropped somewhere nobody reads" — under a GIT_DIR a caller
 * exported, in rebase state that was discarded, or consumed by an earlier pass
 * — and the two readings are not equally cheap to get wrong. For an ordinary
 * branch main's generated artifact already agrees with the merged sources, so a
 * skipped repair changes nothing; for a branch that edits a GENERATOR, main's
 * artifact is WRONG for the merged sources by however much the generator moved,
 * so a skipped repair leaves push checking a commit whose doc contradicts its
 * own code. That is not hypothetical: it cost five failed pushes and is written
 * up in `research/2026-08-19-global-push-normalize-generated-doc-drift.md`.
 * So push's post-rebase call passes `force` and regenerates unconditionally,
 * while the `post-rewrite` hook stays marker-gated — the hook fires after EVERY
 * rebase and has to stay cheap, whereas push is already a multi-minute
 * operation and has to be correct rather than fast. That asymmetry is the only
 * reason this is a flag instead of the default.
 *
 * Under `force` the marker list cannot be trusted to say WHICH pipelines to
 * run either, so both run — the same pair `build` runs unconditionally, and
 * both are idempotent, so the cost of the redundant one is time.
 *
 * Two things it refuses to paper over:
 *   - a hand-edited branch-local migration (`regen-migrations` detects it and
 *     aborts before resetting anything);
 *   - a conflict marker left in CLAUDE.md PROSE, which no regeneration can fix.
 *
 * @param pushId stamped as a `Singularity-Push` trailer on the amend, so a push
 *        that normalizes keeps its commits grouped into one push event. Omitted
 *        by the hook, whose amend must preserve the message exactly as-is.
 * @param force regenerate without consulting the markers (see above).

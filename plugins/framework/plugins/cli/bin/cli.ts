/**
 * The CLI proper: the commander program, the plugin-contributed command
 * registry, and the parse. This IS what `./singularity <cmd>` runs, and it is
 * reached ONLY through `./index.ts`'s `await import("./cli")`.
 *
 * Why the split from `./index.ts` exists: this file's very first line imports
 * `commander`, an npm package. A static import is hoisted above every statement
 * in its module, so a module that wants to run `bun install` BEFORE the CLI
 * cannot also be the module that imports the CLI's dependencies — the resolution
 * would happen first, against the `node_modules` we were about to fix. Reaching
 * this file is therefore the *act* of asserting "`node_modules` is known good".
 * See that file's docblock for the whole contract.
 *
 * Commands are CONTRIBUTIONS, not a list here. A plugin drops a `cli/index.ts`
 * default-exporting `defineCliCommand(…)` and `./singularity build` regenerates
 * `../core/cli.generated.ts` from the filesystem; nothing in the framework CLI
 * names it. Each entry's loader pulls one plugin's declaration — data only, by
 * `cli:command-declarations-light` — and the command's IMPLEMENTATION stays
 * behind the declaration's own lazy `import()` until commander routes to it. So
 * `./singularity build` no longer pays to load every other command's body.

 * This is the BACKSTOP, not the enforcement. `cli:command-names-unique` is what
 * a human sees, and it says strictly more: it reads the registry, so it can name
 * the CLAIMING PLUGINS rather than just the verb, and it walks subcommand paths
 * (`deploy converge`) which this cannot — by the time `loadCollectedDir` has
 * returned, the items no longer carry which plugin they came from. What is left
 * here is the case the check cannot cover: a tree that changed since the last
 * `./singularity check`, where refusing to run beats running the wrong command.

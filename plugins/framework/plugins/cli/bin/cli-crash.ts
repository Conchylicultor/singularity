// Commander's async actions reject rather than exiting, so an unhandled throw
// anywhere inside `build` / `check` / `push` unwinds all the way out to `runCli`,
// which prints it and sets exit 1. The build's own failure funnel is never
// reached, so the verdict guard prints `BUILD FAILED — aborted before completing`
// with NO reason: the transcript on disk names no step, no check and no error,
// and the only copy of what actually happened is a stderr line in whatever
// spawned the CLI. That is what made a host-semaphore identity crash read as a
// contentless build failure.
//
// `runCli` records the error here on its way out; the build's verdict guard pulls
// it at exit time (lazily, exactly like the fatal-signal record) and folds it into
// the banner, so build.log names its own cause on every path.

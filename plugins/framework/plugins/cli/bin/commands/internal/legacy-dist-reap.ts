// One-shot migration reaper for the served dist that used to live INSIDE the

//
// THE GATE is the whole design, and getting it wrong is the one dangerous
// mistake available here: reap only if the RUNNING GATEWAY reports it is already
// serving the new location for this namespace. The gateway is the only authority
// on what it is serving — it holds an in-memory spec, and asking it is the only
// question whose answer cannot be stale.
//
// The gate used to ask `spec.json` on disk instead. That was WRONG and was
// observed to delete a live tree: a build rewrites the spec file, but a gateway
// that has already registered the namespace serves from its own in-memory copy,
// which it refreshes only on a reconcile tick / RefreshSpec. Disk saying the new
// path is therefore no evidence at all about what is being served, and the reap
// removed exactly the tree the gateway was still pointing at — every static
// asset 404'd while the build printed `BUILD OK — deployed`
// (research/2026-08-06-global-one-dist-per-namespace.md, "S4 IS NOT SAFE TO
// SHIP"). Gating on the gateway removes the time-based argument entirely: even
// once the gateway adopts a rewritten spec synchronously on the build's restart
// POST, a build whose restart never lands still leaves disk and gateway memory
// disagreeing until the next reconcile tick. The live reader's own answer has no
// such window.
//
// Reaping unconditionally at sweep time would delete the tree the gateway is
// serving RIGHT NOW, for the entire duration of the build: 404s on every asset
// for minutes. Reaping after `writeWorktreeSpec` instead would still race the
// gateway's adoption of it. Hence: gate, don't order.
//
// Consequence, by design: a namespace whose gateway registration predates its
// first post-S4 build reaps nothing until the gateway has adopted the new path
// (its next restart POST, reconcile tick, or a gateway restart). And on a bare
// release host — `build-composition`, no gateway at all — the gate is closed
// permanently, which costs nothing: a host with no gateway has no legacy served
// dist to reclaim either.

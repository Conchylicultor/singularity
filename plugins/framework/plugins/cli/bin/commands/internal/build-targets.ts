/**
 * WHAT one `./singularity build` invocation deploys — the one place that decides
 * what a build TARGET is.
 *
 * A target is a (composition, checkout) pair, and the checkout half is the same
 * for every target of one invocation: you build the tree you are standing in.
 * The composition half comes from `--composition`, defaulting to the app this
 * repo builds. `namespaceFor` joins them, so `build` from main publishes
 * `sonata`, and the same command in a worktree publishes `sonata.att-x` — a
 * separate namespace, dist and database, which is the whole point of the phase.
 *
 * Everything a target needs to be legal is decided HERE, before any work: the id
 * exists in the manifest, it is a legal composition id, and no other owner
 * already holds the namespace it would claim. A build that is going to be
 * refused must cost milliseconds, not the ten minutes it takes to reach the
 * step that would have noticed.

/**
 * `ensureDeps()` — the ONE chokepoint for "this checkout's `node_modules` is
 * correct for its declared inputs".
 *
 * It replaces the `bun install --silent` that used to run in the `./singularity`
 * shell wrapper, which had three defects in one line: it was **unserialized**
 * (a `check`'s install could race a `build`'s and lose — bun 1.3.13 has no
 * install mutex of its own, and concurrent installs in one checkout race on
 * `clonefileat`), **unattributed** (`--silent` + `set -e` aborted the wrapper
 * before `exec`, so a failed *precondition* became a bare exit 1 that read as
 * the subcommand failing), and **unconditional** (10–25 s of network-bound
 * resolution on every invocation, twice per build).
 * Design: `research/2026-07-30-cli-silent-exit-preinstall-ensure-deps.md`.
 *
 * Freshness is what unlocks the other two fixes: once the common case is silent,
 * there is no longer any reason for `--silent`, so the install runs with
 * stdout/stderr passed straight through and a failure can never again be
 * invisible.
 *
 * MEASURED COST of the fresh-skip path on this repo: ~140 ms — ~126 ms of it the
 * recursive walk of `plugins/` (4044 dirs, 8379 files), ~1.5 ms the 1003 stats —
 * plus ~15 ms of module import, plus one `git rev-parse` when `root` is
 * defaulted. A 60–160× win over the 10–25 s install it replaces, so the walk is
 * deliberately left correct rather than narrowed to the plugin-tree convention:
 * `workspaces: ["plugins/**"]` admits a `package.json` at any depth, and missing
 * one would silently skip a needed install.
 *
 * PRE-INSTALL-SAFE — this module runs BEFORE `node_modules` exists (the CLI
 * bootstrap awaits it; `mise`'s setup task runs it standalone), so it may import
 * only node builtins, relative modules, and `@plugins/*` aliases — never an npm
 * package, and nothing that reaches a plugin barrel with side effects. Static
 * imports hoist above every await, so ONE npm import here breaks a fresh
 * checkout at parse time. `@plugins/*` resolves from `tsconfig.base.json` with
 * no `node_modules` present, and `@plugins/infra/plugins/spawn/core` is verified
 * safe (its transitive imports are node builtins + `spawn-priority/core`). Same
 * class of constraint as the ALIAS-FREE docblock in
 * `plugins/framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/provision/scripts/run-provisions.ts`
 * — but not the same rule: that one runs in the `bun install` postinstall
 * context, where the alias does *not* resolve.

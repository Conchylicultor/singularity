// The one way to run a check pass from another op.
//
// `runChecks()` has exactly ONE in-process caller — the `check` command's own
// action. `build` and `push` both reach it through this helper, which spawns
// that command. That is what makes their two `checks ✓` the same claim.
//
// Why a fresh process, and not a function call:
//
//   • A passing check writes a durable entry to the GLOBAL cache at
//     `~/.singularity/check-cache/`, keyed on the working-tree hash and carrying
//     no provenance. A later push looks that hash up and returns ✓ without
//     running anything — so a recorded PASS is a TRANSFERABLE claim, and it is
//     only honest if the process that produced it did nothing but run checks.
//     A build's process has already imported every plugin barrel and run the
//     slot-declaration pass; a check that reads either sees a world no
//     standalone check can reproduce. Commit `fa7e865e0` shipped a
//     `docs/plugins-details.md` that only a build could regenerate, four
//     consecutive pushes hit the cached pass, and the failure surfaced hours
//     later on an unrelated branch (fixed at the source in `18126884a`).
//   • Push additionally needs the post-rebase code ON DISK, not the module cache
//     frozen at its own process start. Bun freezes a module on first `import()`,
//     so a rebase cannot invalidate anything the parent already loaded.
//
// **Selection is BY PROPERTY, never by id.** `select` carries flags, which the
// CHILD resolves against the registry. There is deliberately no `ids` field: an
// id list computed here would be a registry read performed in the very module
// cache the child exists to escape — the same mistake, one level up. Every
// selection is therefore hand-reproducible (`./singularity check --scope tree`,
// `./singularity check --always-run`) and its emptiness is noticed where it
// matters, inside `runChecks`.
//
// The three callers and what each asserts:
//
//   • `push` — `scope: "tree"`, live output. Deploy-scoped checks verify the
//     local gitignored dist that `build` produces: it never lands on main, and
//     push's own rebase moves the tree past it by construction, so a push can
//     only ever report the artifact as stale for having done its job.
//   • `build` (full pass) — NO scope at all. Build is the caller that *can*
//     assert `deploy`, because it is the one producing the dist.
//   • `build --skip-checks` — `alwaysRun: true`, the cheap structural subset.
//
// **`SINGULARITY_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS` must pass through untouched.** That marker
// is how a dist-comparing check (`web-artifacts:map-in-sync`) learns to skip a
// dist the build is about to replace; the child is the process actually running
// those checks, so it is the one that has to see it. `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` is
// the opposite case — see `env` below.
//
// **No `background` option, deliberately.** `type-check`'s workers already apply
// the agent-branch demotion rule at their own spawn site, so they are covered on
// every path; demoting the whole check subtree from here would be a behaviour
// change smuggled into a refactor.

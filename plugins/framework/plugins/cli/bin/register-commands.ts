/**
 * The ONE translation of a declared {@link CliCommand} into commander calls.
 *
 * Everything a plugin can say about a command is data (`core/internal/command.ts`)
 * precisely so this file can be the only importer of commander outside the
 * bootstrap. That is not tidiness: `commander` is a workspace-local dependency
 * of the CLI plugin, so a contributing plugin's `cli/index.ts` could not import
 * it even if the shape allowed. The closed declaration and the single mapper are
 * two halves of one decision.
 *
 * The commander surface used here is the whole surface the framework's own
 * commands ever used: `command`, `description`, `argument`, `option`,
 * `requiredOption`, `action`. If a command genuinely needs more, the declaration
 * gains a field and this function gains a line — a passthrough
 * (`configure(cmd)`) would hand commander back to contributors and re-open the
 * dependency this design closes.

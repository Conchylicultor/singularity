/**
 * `./singularity`'s entrypoint — and deliberately NOT the CLI. Four ordered
 * steps that must all be able to run with `node_modules` absent or stale:
 *
 *   1. arm the orphan guard
 *   2. `await ensureDeps()`   — this checkout's `node_modules` is correct
 *   3. if it INSTALLED, hand the command to a fresh process and exit
 *   4. `await import("./cli")` — the commander program, from ./cli.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The wrapper used to be:
 *
 *   set -e; cd "$(dirname "$0")"; bun install --silent; exec bun …/bin/index.ts "$@"
 *
 * `bun install` can genuinely fail (bun 1.3.13 has no install mutex, so two
 * concurrent installs in one checkout race on `clonefileat` and one loses).
 * `set -e` then aborted the wrapper before `exec`, and `--silent` meant nothing
 * was printed: every subcommand looked like it had failed on its own, with exit
 * 1 and zero bytes of output — `./singularity check` reading as "checks failed"
 * when no check ever ran. The fix is structural rather than better error
 * handling in shell: there is now NO step before the CLI process, so no step can
 * die before the CLI. The wrapper is a bare `exec`, and the install lives here,
 * inside a process that can attribute its own failures.
 *
 * THE IMPORT CONSTRAINT (the load-bearing part). This module's transitive
 * *static* import set must reach **no npm package** — node builtins, relative
 * repo files and `@plugins/*` aliases only. Static imports are hoisted above
 * every statement in the module, so a single `import { program } from
 * "commander"` here would resolve `commander` out of the very `node_modules`
 * that step 2 exists to repair — the fresh-checkout case would crash on an
 * unresolved module, which is the same class of pre-CLI death this whole file
 * removes. `commander` is exactly why `./cli.ts` exists, and why step 4 is a
 * *dynamic* import: it is the one form that resolves only after step 2 has
 * returned. Enforced by the `cli:bootstrap-package-free` check (the transitive
 * closure is measured with `Bun.build`, so it cannot drift from what actually
 * loads) — if you need a package, put the import in `./cli.ts`.
 *
 * All three current imports satisfy the constraint: `./orphan-guard` has zero
 * imports of its own, and `./ensure-deps` / `./reexec` are written under the
 * same rule (see their docblocks).
 *
 * THE PROCESS CONSTRAINT (step 3, and the reason it is not redundant with the
 * dynamic import). Bun's resolver caches directory listings from the moment it
 * loads this process's first modules, so a process that installs `node_modules`
 * cannot see what it installed: `plugins/framework/plugins/cli/node_modules` is
 * already cached as absent, and step 4 then fails with `Cannot find package
 * 'commander'` on every fresh checkout. The dynamic import fixes WHEN resolution
 * happens; step 3 fixes WHICH PROCESS does it. Full reproduction and rationale:
 * `./reexec.ts`.

// The command runs in THIS process, whose ppid is the invoking shell — so it
// observes its own orphaning directly. Terminate when that shell dies, so an
// orphaned CLI never holds a host lock (the push mutex worst case) forever.
//
// FIRST, before the install: the guard must be armed for the whole lifetime of
// this process, install included, or an orphan could sit on the install lock —
// the one lock every other CLI invocation in this checkout queues behind.
//
// UNCONDITIONAL, and this file reads no argv at all. It used to match
// `process.argv[2]` against a hardcoded {build, check, push} set, which a CLI
// whose commands are plugin contributions cannot keep: this line runs before the
// install, so it cannot load the declarations that would answer the question.
// Arming for everything removes the question instead of re-answering it from a
// second copy. A command that is MEANT to outlive its shell declares
// `detachable` and the mapper disarms it once argv is parsed — see
// `./orphan-guard.ts`.

// The one dependency chokepoint: freshness-gated (the common case is ~140 ms and
// silent — see its docblock for the measured breakdown), serialized against
// every other CLI-mediated install, and loud. On
// failure it throws a message written to be the entire story — which phase
// failed, the likely cause, and what to do — so print the message and stop.
// Deliberately no stack: the stack would name this bootstrap, not the problem.

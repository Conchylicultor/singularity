/**
 * The CLI command declaration — what a plugin's `cli/index.ts` default-exports,
 * and the whole of what `./singularity` knows about a command before it runs it.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES SHAPE EVERY TYPE HERE.
 *
 * 1. THE DECLARATION IS REACHED ON EVERY INVOCATION; THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT.
 *    Commander needs a command's name, flags and help text before it can parse
 *    argv, so every plugin's declaration loads on every single `./singularity`
 *    call — including the hot `build` path. Its implementation must not: that is
 *    why {@link CliCommandSpec.run} hands back the *module* rather than the
 *    function, so the body is behind a dynamic `import()` that only executes
 *    once commander has routed to this command. Enforced by
 *    `cli:command-declarations-light`, which measures each `cli/index.ts`'s
 *    static closure and fails it for reaching an npm package or a `web`/`server`
 *    barrel.
 *
 * 2. THE SHAPE IS CLOSED, NOT A COMMANDER PASSTHROUGH. Across all of the
 *    framework's own commands the entire commander surface in use is
 *    `command` / `description` / `argument` / `option` / `requiredOption` /
 *    `action`, plus `enablePositionalOptions` / `passThroughOptions` behind
 *    {@link CliLeafSpec.passthroughArgs}. Modelling exactly that — rather than
 *    exposing a `configure(cmd: Command)` escape hatch — is what lets `core/`
 *    stay free of commander, which in turn is what lets a contributing plugin
 *    declare a command at all: `commander` is a workspace-local dependency of
 *    the CLI plugin and would not even resolve from another workspace package.
 *    A contributor cannot reach for a commander feature the mapper does not
 *    model, because they cannot reach commander.
 *
 * `bin/register-commands.ts` is the sole translation of these types into
 * commander calls.

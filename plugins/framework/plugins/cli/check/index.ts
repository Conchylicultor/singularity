/**
 * A registered pre-barrel or post-web codegen manifest may not be LOADED by a
 * CLI process that later REGENERATES it. Measured as two rules, because a CLI
 * process is two closures:
 *   1. the STARTUP closure — what every `./singularity` invocation loads, whatever
 *      the verb — may load no manifest at all;
 *   2. the RUN closure of every command that regenerates the manifests in-process
 *      may load no manifest either.
 *
 * WHY, precisely — this is a correctness invariant guarding authored user data,
 * not tidiness. Bun's ESM cache freezes a module on its first `import()`, and a
 * later disk write cannot invalidate it. Stage 2 of the build pipeline
 * (`generateAppSources` → `regenerateManifestCodegen`) REGENERATES every
 * pre-barrel manifest and then imports every plugin barrel to collect the
 * config_v2 descriptors those barrels register at module-load. A manifest the
 * process already imported is rewritten on disk and NEVER re-read: the barrels
 * then register the PREVIOUS run's descriptor set, `generateConfigOrigins`
 * records that stale set, and `pruneOrphanedConfigFiles` DELETES a
 * freshly-authored config override as an orphan. Silent data loss, with no
 * failing step to point at.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY MECHANICAL PROTECTION against a load-time freeze. The two
 * things that look like they cover it do not:
 *   - `assertPreBarrelManifestsFresh` (the runtime freeze-point guard) re-renders
 *     each manifest and compares TO DISK. On a load-time freeze the disk copy is
 *     fresh — stage 2 just wrote it — so the guard passes green while the frozen
 *     copy in memory is a run behind. It detects an ORDERING mistake inside the
 *     pipeline, not a freeze that happened before the pipeline started.
 *   - `pre-barrel-manifests-complete` answers a different question entirely: is a
 *     barrel-reachable `*.generated.ts` registered as a manifest at all. It says
 *     nothing about who else imported one.
 * Nothing else in the repo can see a manifest frozen at CLI load.
 *
 * THE HAZARD NEEDS BOTH HALVES IN ONE PROCESS — a load, and a later regeneration
 * — and the two closures are exactly where they can meet:
 *   - STARTUP, because it is in EVERY process, `build`'s included. It is
 *     `bin/index.ts`'s closure with literal dynamic edges followed:
 *     `await import("./cli")`, and `cli.generated.ts`'s loaders, which evaluate
 *     every command's DECLARATION on every invocation (commander needs their
 *     names and flags before it can parse argv). A manifest here is frozen in the
 *     regenerating process too, whichever command that turns out to be.
 *   - A REGENERATING command's run closure, because that body shares its process
 *     with the regeneration. A command whose body never regenerates cannot go
 *     stale — whatever it loads is simply what is on disk, for the whole life of
 *     the process. `deploy converge` loading `fieldsEager` (through the
 *     entity-backed deploy-health handle it reads) is harmless for exactly that
 *     reason, and flagging it would be a rule about a process that does not
 *     exist.
 *
 * WHY `run` EDGES ARE CUT — the CLI contract. A declaration defers its body
 * behind `run: () => import("./run")`, and `bin/register-commands.ts`, the sole
 * caller of `run()`, awaits it only once commander has routed to THAT command:
 * one process runs one command's body. Following every thunk from `bin/index.ts`
 * (as this check once did) measures a process that never exists — every
 * command's body loaded at once — and charged `build` for what only `deploy`
 * imports. The cut is by SHAPE, not by file (`scanCommandRuns`): an
 * `import("<literal>")` that is the whole body of the arrow assigned to `run` in
 * a `defineCliCommand({…})` call. Every other dynamic edge — `./cli`, the
 * registry loaders, the check loaders — is still followed, and a thunk written
 * in any other shape is followed too, so a miss costs a false positive, never a
 * hole.
 *
 * NEITHER THE COMMANDS NOR THE REGENERATORS ARE LISTED. The run closures measured
 * are exactly the thunks the startup measurement cut, so a new command is held to
 * this the moment it is registered. "Regenerates" is read off each closure: a
 * module that CALLS the registry's own writer (`writePreBarrelManifest`, named
 * here through the imported function, so a rename is a type error rather than a
 * silent miss) and is LIVE — kept by the bundler's tree-shaking, i.e. referenced
 * from code that can run. Live, not merely loaded, and that distinction is the
 * whole rule: the codegen barrel re-exports the pipeline, so every command that
 * reads ANY codegen helper loads the regenerating module (`deploy converge`
 * does, through `closure-guards.ts`); only one that can call it is regenerating.
 * On this tree that is `build` (stage 2), `regen-generated`, and `check` — the
 * last conservatively: its closure keeps the whole codegen barrel live, so it is
 * held to the rule without ever regenerating, which costs nothing while its
 * closure is clean. `push` and `normalize-generated` are NOT regenerators: both
 * reach `regen-generated` by spawning it.
 *
 * `release` IS THE PROCESS-ISOLATION CASE, and it measures as designed. It needs
 * stage 2, and its body statically imports plugin barrels (`propagateConfigToUser`
 * via codegen, `resolveIconSvgNodes`, `runAssetMirrorPrewarm`, …), so running
 * the pipeline in-process would be the hazard. It SPAWNS `build --hermetic`
 * instead, so its run closure holds no live writer call and is not a regenerator;
 * the child is a fresh `build` process, held to both rules above in its own
 * right. The same holds for any command that shells out to a regenerating one: a
 * separate process has a separate module cache, so that is not a hole.
 *
 * MEASURED ON WHAT THE RUNTIME LOADS, not on what survives tree-shaking. The
 * manifest test reads `importClosure`'s `modules` (every module the bundler
 * parsed), because Bun's runtime does no tree-shaking: `fieldsEager` is nothing
 * but bare side-effect imports, contributes no code of its own, and so never
 * appears in the tree-shaken set at all — while it is evaluated, and frozen,
 * all the same. (This check previously read the tree-shaken set. Measured alone,
 * `deploy converge`'s tree-shaken set holds neither `fieldsEager` nor the
 * `entities/server` barrel that imports it, while the runtime loads both — and
 * whether a side-effect-only module shows up at all depended on what ELSE the
 * bundle held.)
 *
 * This REPLACES `cli:build-composition-import-subset`, which compared two
 * command files' module sets so that `build-composition` INHERITED the property
 * from `build` rather than re-deriving it. That framing never measured the
 * stated property at all. A frozen BARREL is harmless while everything it
 * reaches is stable; the hazard is its GENERATED INPUTS changing mid-run, which
 * is what this check measures directly.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated rather than left implicit. The registry-phase outputs —
 * `checks/core/check.generated.ts`, `paths/core/data-dirs.generated.ts`,
 * `barrel-import/…/auto-stubs.generated.ts` — ARE loaded by regenerating
 * processes and ARE rewritten in-process by stage 1, i.e. the same mechanism.
 * They are out of scope deliberately: their staleness costs one run of registry
 * content (a missing check or a missing stub — loud, or benign), never the
 * silent deletion of authored data; and they arrive through `paths/server`,
 * `checks/core` and `barrel-import/core`, which the CLI cannot stop importing
 * without losing the ability to run checks or resolve its own data dirs.
 * Reopening that is a separate task, not a hole in this one.
 * `icon-picker/…/icon-svg-map.generated.ts` is produced by a hand-run script,
 * never by a build stage, so no build run can invalidate a frozen copy of it.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS, stated rather than papered over: this is a STATIC measurement.
 *   - An `import()` whose specifier is COMPUTED at runtime is invisible to the
 *     bundler, as it is to every static tool. `compositionFleetSource` /
 *     `defaultFleetSource` reach `web-tiers.generated.ts` exactly that way —
 *     harmlessly, because that happens in stage 3, after the config-origins pass
 *     has already run. A hazardous computed-specifier import would pass here, and
 *     so would a regeneration reached only through one.
 *   - "Regenerates" means "calls the registry's writer". A module that wrote a
 *     manifest by some other route — its standalone `generateX` helper, or a
 *     hand-rolled `writeFileSync` — would not mark its command as regenerating.
 *     None does today; the pipeline writes every manifest through the writer.
 *   - In the other direction the check is CONSERVATIVE on purpose, in three ways:
 *     liveness is per MODULE (a module is live if any of its exports is, so the
 *     regenerating pipeline counts whichever of its entry points is referenced);
 *     literal dynamic edges are followed, which pulls every check module into a
 *     regenerating command's closure via `check.generated.ts`'s loaders, so a
 *     CHECK that imported a manifest is flagged even though checks run in stage
 *     3, after the origins pass; and a command's whole run closure counts, not
 *     just what loads before stage 2. That is deliberate — the remedy (read the
 *     manifest's bytes instead of importing it) is cheap and independently right,
 *     so a false positive costs a small correct edit rather than an argument
 *     about phases.
 *
 * `alwaysRun: true` — cheap (~1.3 s: one bundler pass for startup plus one per
 * command body), structural, codegen-coupled, and decisively: the hermetic build
 * path runs stage 2 (and therefore `pruneOrphanedConfigFiles`) while running
 * ONLY the always-run set. A check that guards stage 2 but is skipped whenever
 * stage 2 runs without a full check pass guards nothing. The check this replaces
 * was not `alwaysRun`; that was a gap, not a decision.

/**
 * `bin/index.ts` — the CLI's bootstrap — must reach NO npm package through its
 * static import closure.
 *
 * WHY, precisely: `bin/index.ts` is the process that RUNS `bun install`. It arms
 * the orphan guard, `await ensureDeps()`, and only then `await import("./cli.ts")`.
 * Static imports hoist above all of that — an ES module's entire dependency graph
 * is resolved and evaluated BEFORE its first statement executes. So one
 * `import { program } from "commander"` at the top of `bin/index.ts` means a
 * checkout with no `node_modules` dies on an unresolved module before a single
 * line of the bootstrap runs. The CLI can no longer install its own dependencies,
 * and the failure is exactly the shape this whole design exists to eliminate: a
 * pre-CLI death with no subcommand to attribute it to (`./singularity check` →
 * exit 1, and the module error names `commander`, not "your deps are missing").
 * `rm -rf node_modules && ./singularity build` is then unrecoverable from inside
 * the repo, which is also the fresh-clone path.
 *
 * That is the entire reason the bootstrap / `cli.ts` split exists: today's
 * commander program lives in `bin/cli.ts` precisely so it is reached by a
 * DYNAMIC import, evaluated after the install. Nothing marks `bin/index.ts` as
 * special at the language level, so the split survives only as long as something
 * measures it — the next edit that "just adds an import at the top" silently
 * undoes it.
 *
 * NOT THE WHOLE STORY, and this check must not be read as saying it is. Passing
 * here means nothing resolves BEFORE the install; it says nothing about whether
 * what resolves after it can be found. Bun's resolver caches directory listings,
 * so the installing process cannot see its own `node_modules` — a green check
 * here still ended in `Cannot find package 'commander'` on every fresh checkout
 * until `bin/index.ts` started re-execing after an install. Ordering and process
 * identity are two separate requirements; this check measures the first.
 * `bin/reexec.ts` owns the second.
 *
 * Measured off the same `Bun.build` closure as the check above, from the opposite
 * side: the set of specifiers the resolver declared external IS the set the
 * entrypoint needs `node_modules` for. No independent scanner, and the alias
 * prefixes come from `tsconfig.base.json`, so a new alias cannot turn a repo
 * subtree into a false "npm package" (nor the reverse).
 *
 * Measured with `dynamicImports: "cut"`, which is the whole subtlety. The hazard is
 * HOISTING, so the subject is the static graph only: `bin/index.ts`'s deliberate
 * `await import("./cli.ts")` is a literal specifier the bundler happily follows,
 * and following it would drag `cli.ts`'s entire npm closure (commander, pg, …)
 * into this check's numbers and fail it permanently — while proving nothing, since
 * those packages resolve when that `import()` executes, i.e. after `ensureDeps()`.
 * Cutting the graph at every `import()` edge measures exactly the set that is
 * resolved before the bootstrap's first statement.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than papered over: static measurement cannot see an
 * `import()` whose specifier is computed at runtime — nor, by the paragraph above,
 * does this check look inside any dynamic edge at all. So a package reached only
 * that way passes. That is a deliberate scope, not a hole: a dynamic import does
 * not hoist, so it cannot resolve before `ensureDeps()` has run, which is the one
 * failure mode this check exists to prevent. What it does NOT cover is a dynamic
 * import placed *ahead* of `ensureDeps()` in the bootstrap's own control flow —
 * a shape a reader of that deliberately-tiny file can see at a glance, and which
 * no static import-graph measurement can distinguish from a correctly-placed one.

 * way to defer a DECLARATION — `./singularity build` pays for every other
 * plugin's declaration, every time. The command's IMPLEMENTATION is the part

 * `run: () => import("./run")`. Nothing in the language marks which half is

 * their declaration to reuse one constant has silently moved their whole command
 * body — and its npm dependencies, and every plugin barrel it reaches — into the
 * hot path of an unrelated command. That edit looks harmless and its cost is
 * invisible, which is exactly the shape that needs a mechanical check rather
 * than a documented convention.
 *
 * The `server` ban is the same rule stated where it bites hardest: a server
 * barrel is the cheapest-looking way for a declaration to reach a real value (an
 * option default like `REPO_ROOT`), and it is also the single heaviest thing in
 * the repo to load — drizzle, pg, the DB pool, the job queue. Resolve such a

 * reason this can be a check at all: the declaration's own
 * `run: () => import("./run")` is a literal specifier the bundler would happily
 * follow, and following it would drag in precisely the implementation this check
 * exists to keep out — reporting every correctly-written command as a failure.
 * Cutting at every `import()` edge measures exactly what the CLI pays before it
 * knows which command it is running.
 *
 * The subject list comes from `cli.generated.ts` rather than a filesystem walk,
 * so it is the same set the CLI actually loads. A `cli/index.ts` with no default

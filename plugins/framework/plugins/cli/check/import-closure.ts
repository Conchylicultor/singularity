/**
 * What a measurement does with an `import()` edge. Required, and a closed set,

 * default:
 *
 *   - `"cut"` — every `import()` is a traversal BOUNDARY: the specifier is
 *     neither followed nor recorded in `external`. The subject is the STATIC
 *     graph, i.e. what resolves before the entrypoint's first statement runs.
 *     The bootstrap and declaration checks want exactly that: a dynamic edge is
 *     where "must resolve pre-install" / "is paid by every invocation" stops
 *     applying.
 *   - `"follow-except-command-runs"` — every LITERAL `import()` is followed,
 *     except a command declaration's `run` thunk, which is cut and reported in
 *     {@link ImportClosure.commandRuns}. The subject is what ONE CLI PROCESS can
 *     load: `bin/index.ts`'s own `await import("./cli")` and the
 *     `cli.generated.ts` loaders execute on every invocation, so they are
 *     followed; a `run` body executes only when commander routes to THAT
 *     command, so it belongs to that command's process and not to every
 *     process. See {@link scanCommandRuns} for how a `run` edge is told apart
 *     from every other dynamic edge.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "follow everything" policy any more: following every
 * `run` thunk from `bin/index.ts` measures a process that never exists — every
 * command's body loaded at once — and charges `build` for what only `deploy`
 * imports.

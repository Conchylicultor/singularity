# Singularity's prerequisite check: names EVERY missing prerequisite in one run,
# each with the command that fixes it, then exits 1 if anything REQUIRED was
# missing. A recommended one (Claude Code) is named with its fix too, but does
# not fail the run: nothing that stands the app up uses it, and the running app
# refuses each use of it with the same fix (infra/claude-cli/availability).
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: its most important case is Bun itself missing, where no
# TypeScript can run. Run it from the checkout it checks (the cwd is the
# checkout):
#
#   mise run doctor      — by hand; also the tail of every `mise install`
#   ./singularity start / build — their first step (see ./cli/prerequisites.ts)
#
# It asks only "is it there". Which release (floors, holds, shadowing) is
# `toolchain:resolved`'s job, and the tool list itself comes from mise.toml +
# mise.lock through mise, so adding a tool there needs no change here.
#
# Probes are builtins plus the tools being checked (id, uname, xcode-select,
# git, mise, claude), so the test can stub every one of them on PATH.

/**
 * The converge script: the whole convergent host state for one deployment, as
 * one idempotent shell script generated from the deployment row.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `converge.ts` for one reason: a ~200-line shell
 * template whose only execution path is a remote host 15 minutes and a 100MB
 * round trip away is a template whose typos are discovered in production.
 * Everything in this file is a pure function of plain values, so
 * `converge-script.test.ts` can `bash -n` the result and exercise
 * {@link PUT_HELPER_SH} against real files.
 *
 * ### The idempotence contract
 *
 * Two properties, and the second depends on the first:
 *
 * 1. **No step claims `[=]` without having compared.** Every generated file
 *    lands through `put`, which replaces the target only when the bytes differ
 *    — so an unchanged file keeps its old mtime, and the `[=]`/`[~]` in the log
 *    is derived rather than asserted. The steps that are not file writes (the
 *    packages, Caddy's reload, ufw) read the host's own state first for the
 *    same reason.
 * 2. **The restart is gated on the host's state, not on this run's memory.** It
 *    fires when the RUNNING process predates its configuration — which is a
 *    no-op on an unchanged host, and still repairs the install when a previous
 *    converge wrote a new `env` and died before restarting it.
 *
 * Design: `research/2026-07-31-deploy-converge-idempotence.md`, amending D3 of
 * `research/2026-07-29-global-composition-production-deployment.md`.

 * - The log stops lying. `[=]` is the return value of a comparison, not a

 * - The mtime becomes meaningful. An unchanged file keeps its old timestamp,

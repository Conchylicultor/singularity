/**
 * `./singularity deploy converge|ship` — the two verbs over a deployment.
 *
 * **converge** makes a host serve a composition: run user, dir layout, the
 * `env` EnvironmentFile, Caddy, the systemd unit, the firewall.
 * **ship** puts a bundle on it and activates it behind a health gate.
 *
 * Design: `research/2026-07-29-global-composition-production-deployment.md`
 * (D3 + D4). Three properties of that design shape this command:
 *
 * - **Nothing about the install is authored.** Every path, user and unit name
 *   comes from `deriveInstall` (`deployments/core/derive.ts`); a path spelled
 *   twice is a path that eventually disagrees with itself. The unit *template*
 *   is `deriveInstall(SYSTEMD_INSTANCE)` — the same function of `"%i"` — so
 *   the template and the real instance's paths cannot drift.
 * - **Converge is one generated script, not a checked-in `bootstrap.sh`.** It
 *   is a pure function of the deployment row, uploaded and run as the server's
 *   LOGIN user (root — it creates users and writes `/etc`); the run user is a
 *   different, unprivileged, derived one, and that split is the whole point.
 *   There is no file on the box a human is expected to edit.
 * - **Refusals come before any host mutation**, each named. A server we have
 *   never reached, a non-Debian host, a composition carrying owner data behind
 *   a public hostname, or a closure needing `infra/secrets` are all refused by
 *   name rather than compared against a null.
 *
 * ### Where the CLI reads its inputs, and why the two transports differ
 *
 * - The **deployment record** goes over HTTP to this checkout's own backend,
 *   through the endpoint contracts the plugin publishes in `core/` *for this
 *   consumer*. That keeps `assertKnownComposition`, the hostname/port
 *   validation and the unique-constraint → 409 mapping as the single writer of
 *   that table. (It is also the only option: the deployments *server* barrel
 *   eagerly imports `config_v2/server`, which throws at module eval without
 *   `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` — so a CLI process cannot import its table.)
 * - The **server row + its health row** are read straight from the DB, because
 *   they have no core-level wire contract: `servers`/`health` keep theirs in
 *   plugin-private `shared/`, and the TOFU-pinned `hostKeyLine` is
 *   deliberately withheld from the wire. The CLI needs that pin — connecting
 *   with `hostKey: { mode: "learn" }` would silently accept a changed host key,
 *   i.e. weaker verification than the probe already established.
 *
 * Both resolve against `currentWorktreeName()`, so the CLI acts on exactly the
 * namespace whose Deploy app you are looking at: bare on a checkout that is
 * `main`, or the spawning backend's own worktree when the D5 UI shells out.

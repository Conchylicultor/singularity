/**
 * The command the whole agent workflow runs on: `./singularity build` is how a
 * checkout's work becomes a running app at `http://<worktree>.localhost:9000`.
 *
 * It is a leaf with two postures over one pipeline — deploy this checkout into
 * the live dev cluster (the default), or produce a composition's artifact set
 * hermetically (`--hermetic --composition`, which is what `release` shells
 * into). The posture branch is the literal first statement of `./run.ts`, so
 * the deploy machinery (progress log, op profiler, run ledger, verdict guard,
 * deploy receipt) is structurally absent from the hermetic path rather than
 * skipped by scattered guards.
 *
 * Not `detachable`: build is an op command, and the orphan guard exiting it
 * when its invoking shell dies is what stops an abandoned build from sitting on
 * the build lock and a host grant. The detached self-restart build exempts
 * itself through `SINGULARITY_BUILD_DETACHED` instead.

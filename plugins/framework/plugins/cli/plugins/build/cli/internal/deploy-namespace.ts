/**
 * Deploy ONE namespace into the live dev cluster: the per-target half of
 * `./singularity build`, run once per `--composition` (and once, unnamed, for a
 * plain build).
 *
 *   marker → dist → database → config → (marker again) + spec → restart → health
 *   probe
 *
 * It exists as its own module for the reason the plan for this phase gives:
 * `run.ts`'s terminal funnel closes over eleven invocation-scoped values, and
 * fanning out inside the largest closure in the repo is how that file reached
 * 1900 lines. So the split is by SCOPE, not by topic — everything here is a
 * function of one (composition, checkout) pair, and everything that is a
 * function of the invocation (the lock, codegen, the checks pass, the ledger
 * row, the transcript, the profile, the ONE verdict) stays in `run.ts`.
 *
 * FAILURE IS A TYPE. This function never calls `process.exit` and never prints a
 * verdict — it returns a discriminated result, exactly like `ArtifactBuildResult`
 * does one level down, and `run.ts` routes a failure into its single funnel.
 * That is what lets the caller say what published, what failed, and what was not
 * attempted, in one banner, for an invocation that had several targets.
 *
 * It absorbs the old `compose-serve.ts`'s `serveOne`: the provenance marker, and
 * the spec-LAST ordering. What it does NOT absorb is that stage's tolerance for
 * a failed restart — a composition backend that crashes on boot now fails the
 * build the same way the main app's does, because "the build said OK and the app
 * 502s" is the one outcome a deploy verb may never produce.

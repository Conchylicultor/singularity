/**
 * The HERMETIC posture of `./singularity build` (`--hermetic --composition …`):
 * produce the app-artifact set for one or more compositions — filtered
 * registries, generated migration SQL, one web dist each — as a deterministic
 * function of (source tree, composition). Nothing here reads or mutates the
 * local dev cluster, so a release can be cut on a bare host from a fresh
 * `git clone`.
 *
 * A thin ordered stage sequence over a shared pipeline, exactly like
 * `regen-generated` is over `codegen/core/regen-pipeline.ts`: every step lives
 * in ./app-artifacts.ts, which the deploy posture also calls, so the two cannot
 * drift. Design + rationale:
 * research/2026-07-28-cli-hermetic-artifact-phase.md and
 * research/2026-08-18-cli-one-build-verb-artifact-half.md.
 *
 * Deliberately ABSENT — this list IS the definition of what `--hermetic` turns
 * off, because the deploy those steps serve does not exist here:
 *   - the branch guard and therefore `--allow-main` (routinising a DANGER flag
 *     on every release from main erodes it; dropping it is a net improvement),
 *   - `--no-restart` / `--skip-checks` (nothing to restart; the fast validation
 *     set is unconditional),
 *   - `ensureHooksPath` / `registerMergeDrivers` / `checkBroadcasts` — git-config
 *     self-heals and an agent-facing message channel, both dev-workstation
 *     concerns nobody watches on a release host,
 *   - Postgres readiness, the worktree DB fork, gateway specs/restarts/health
 *     probes, the per-namespace deploy sequence,
 *   - the `build_runs` ledger, worktree-op markers, the build-progress log, the
 *     build profile and the verdict guard. A release already has its own durable
 *     artifact (`release-logs-<id>.json`); emitting build records for a run that
 *     is not a build is what polluted the build Gantt.
 * Consequently `hooks` below are light: `log` still reaches the console (the
 * release streams this process's stdout as its progress), but no span, footprint
 * or step is persisted anywhere.
 *
 * Those absences are why this is a SEPARATE FUNCTION rather than ~20 scattered
 * `if (!opts.hermetic)` guards inside `build`'s action. `build` arms, in its
 * first few hundred lines and interleaved with real work, `openBuildProgress`,
 * `createOpProfiler`, `createBuildRunRecorder`, `markWorktreeOpStart`, a
 * `process.on("exit")` hook, `installVerdictGuard`, `installFatalSignalExit` and
 * `writeBuildReceipt` — and the exit-code contract below is precisely the claim
 * that NONE of them is armed. Inline, that claim survives only as long as
 * nobody adds the 21st exit hook without its guard; branch-once-and-delegate
 * makes it structural, because this path never enters the function that arms
 * them.
 *
 * The orphan guard is the one piece of op-command machinery this path DOES get.
 * `bin/index.ts` arms it for every invocation, so a hermetic child is guarded by
 * construction — it used to depend on `build` being in an `OP_COMMANDS` set that
 * `bin/index.ts` matched against `process.argv[2]`, which happened to hold
 * because `build --hermetic` still has `build` at argv[2]. Under `release` this
 * child's ppid is release's own pid, so the guard is inert unless release itself
 * dies — in which case exiting, and thereby dropping `.build.lock`, is the right
 * behaviour.
 */

/**
 * Deploy-only flags plus the phase-scoped refusals, as data: one message per
 * conflict, `[]` when the invocation is coherent. Pure and exported so the
 * matrix is testable without building anything — the refusals have to fire in
 * milliseconds (before `ensureDeps`), and a guard that is only exercised by a
 * 10-minute build is a guard nobody re-runs.

/**
 * The launcher a packaged app ships with: one process that brings up a gateway,
 * an embedded Postgres and the app's own backend under an isolated
 * `SINGULARITY_DIR`, then stays up serving.
 *
 * DETACHABLE, AND THE ONLY COMMAND THAT IS. `bin/index.ts` arms the orphan
 * guard for every invocation — a CLI process dies with the shell that started
 * it, so an op can never sit on a host lock after its invoker is gone. That is
 * exactly wrong here: `serve-app` boots a runtime whose whole job is to outlive
 * the shell (`nohup ./singularity serve-app … &` is the sanctioned way to start
 * a packaged app), and under the guard it would exit 140 the moment its
 * invoking shell went away. Declaring `detachable` makes the mapper disarm the
 * guard as the command begins, which is the one place "is this command meant to
 * outlive its shell" is knowable — the bootstrap that arms it runs before argv
 * is parsed.

/**
 * The exit codes `./singularity await` answers with.
 *
 * Four states, four codes, because the caller is usually an agent deciding what
 * to do next and three of them are NOT "the op failed":
 *
 * - `ended` (0)        — every awaited op reached a terminal record, all good.
 * - `failed` (1)       — at least one ended with a non-success outcome.
 * - `stillRunning` (70)— the wait hit its own cap first. Nothing is wrong; call
 *                        again. Collapsing this into 1 would make a slow build
 *                        indistinguishable from a broken one.
 * - `nothing` (3)      — there was nothing to await. Awaiting an op that is not
 *                        running is a mistake about the world, not a verdict on
 *                        it, so it can never read as either success or failure.

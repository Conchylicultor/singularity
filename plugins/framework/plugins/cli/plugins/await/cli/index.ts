/**
 * Block until this checkout's running op finishes, and say what it did.
 *
 * The op it waits on is NOT started here — `await` never spawns anything. The
 * op keeps running as whatever started it (a `run_in_background` Bash task, a
 * second terminal, the app's own build job); this command only watches, so
 * killing the wait kills nothing. That split is the point: a fused
 * "start-and-wait" would have to own the child, and the CLI's orphan guard
 * (see `defineCliCommand`'s `detachable`) then kills the op the moment its
 * invoking shell dies — which is precisely what happens when an agent's
 * foreground tool call hits its 10-minute cap.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * A subagent that backgrounds a long op is never re-invoked when it finishes:
 * the harness files the completion notification under the PARENT session's
 * queue, where it sits undelivered (upstream anthropics/claude-code #88423,
 * #87689, #85534 — all open). Measured in conv-1789736383-4i30: two teammates
 * ended their turns on a background `check` and `test`, both finished with exit
 * 0 two minutes later, and nothing moved for nine hours.
 *
 * So the wake-up stops being something to be told and becomes a tool result.
 * The agent runs its op in the background as before, then calls this and holds
 * its turn open until the verdict lands.
 *
 * Not `detachable`: dying with its shell is exactly right for a wait.

/**
 * The correct spelling of "run a repo script", and the reason it is a command
 * rather than a convention.
 *
 * Module resolution walks UP the directory tree, and worktrees live under the
 * main checkout — so `bun plugins/…/e2e/foo.ts` from a worktree with no
 * `node_modules` of its own silently resolves every dependency out of the MAIN
 * checkout's installed tree, or, if that tree is absent or mid-replacement, out
 * of bun's auto-install, which ignores `bun.lock` and every pin and fetches
 * registry `latest`. A branch that bumps a dependency does not get its bump.
 *
 * `bin/index.ts` runs `ensureDeps()` before dispatch on every invocation, so
 * routing a script through a CLI verb is what buys it this worktree's own
 * `node_modules`, installed from this branch's lock, plus the postinstall
 * provisioning that goes with it (~140 ms on the fresh-stamp path).
 *
 * Deliberately ONE general verb, not `./singularity e2e`. The defect is not
 * e2e-specific — the `scripts/` directories under `plugins/` hold a dozen more
 * runnable scripts, one of which writes to the database through `drizzle-orm`
 * — and an e2e script is just a script.

/**
 * The signal-origin tap expressed once, as the hook pair `installFatalSignalExit`
 * takes. `build`, `check` and `push` all await this and differ only in what
 * their own `onSignal` does with the origin.
 *
 * Async because the tap's shim is a dependency (`signal-origin-shim`, a
 * `build` kind): it is ensured here, BEFORE the listeners are installed, so the
 * arm itself stays the synchronous call `afterInstall` needs.
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing:
 *
 * - `afterInstall` is where the native SA_SIGINFO tap arms, and it may not move.
 *   **Bun installs its own `sigaction` lazily on the first `process.on(sig)` and
 *   does NOT chain**, so a tap armed before that loop is silently overwritten
 *   and never fires. `afterInstall` is the seam that guarantees the order; see
 *   its docblock in fatal-signals.ts.
 * - `onSignal` reads the slot the tap filled — by then the native handler has
 *   already run (it sits underneath Bun's own and chains up to it), so the read
 *   is the sender's identity rather than a guess — and writes the sink line.
 *
 * An arm failure — including a shim that could not be installed — is recorded
 * rather than printed. A banner on every op on a machine without a C toolchain
 * would be noise in exactly the transcript this feature exists to keep
 * readable; the sink is where the absence goes on the record (and a failed
 * install is also `failed` in `./singularity deps list` / Settings →
 * Dependencies), so a later unattributed death is explainable rather than
 * mysterious. `origin: null` on a `signal` line means the same thing from the
 * other side: "we looked and could not see", never "nobody sent a signal".

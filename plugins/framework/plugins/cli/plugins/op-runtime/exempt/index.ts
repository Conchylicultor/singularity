It runs precisely when the box is in trouble, so it takes the lightest possible watch — a single non-recursive fs.watch on one directory, filtered to one filename — rather than loading @parcel/watcher's native addon and a recursive, debounced subscription for a single wake-up. A foreground wait, not background activity: there is no catalog entry to report into.",

   *   grant, the duress valve). Blocked is not wedged, so the waiter's clock is
   *   paused for as long as that lasts. Without this, a holder queued behind
   *   other work made every command behind it time out: a deploy's release
   *   died after 983 s behind a main build that sat 882 s in the host-grant
   *   queue and was healthy throughout.
   * - `working` — the waiter fails after `stallMs` with no advance.
   * - `unknown` — the plain `capMs` bound, as if there were no observer.
   *
   * The authority on that is the durable build-progress + op logs, which live in
   * `op-runtime` / `op-log` because they reach the file-sink primitive and a
   * data-dir declaration. This module is statically reachable from
   * `bin/index.ts` through `ensure-deps`, i.e. it loads BEFORE `bun install` has
   * run, so it cannot import them — `cli:bootstrap-package-free` exists to keep
   * that closure empty.
   *
   * Inverting it is what removes the problem rather than hiding it. A dynamic
   * `import()` kept the closure clean but made a real cross-plugin edge
   * invisible to the boundary system, which is exactly what R9 (`inline-import`)
   * forbids. With the observer injected, the edge does not exist: `bootstrap`
   * names no plugin the pre-install path cannot afford, and the one caller that
   * HAS the logs (`app-artifacts`, deep in the build) passes it in.
   *
   * Omitted by the install lock, which no build progress covers.

 * checkout's locks — `.build.lock` (the build) and `.install.lock` (the
 * dependency install) — which is why the caller names which one in `opts.what`.
 *
 * The lock is an exclusive `flock(2)` on a regular file. flock is owned by the
 * open file description, so the kernel drops it when the fd closes OR when the
 * holding process dies — SIGKILL, OOM and power loss included — and no pid is
 * consulted, so PID reuse cannot confuse it. A build killed by a caller timeout
 * therefore cannot leave a lock that outlives it: "a stale lock with no holder"
 * is not a state this can reach.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A HEARTBEAT (do not put one back). This was a symlink whose
 * target encoded `pid-<pid>-<ts>`, refreshed on a 5 s timer, with waiters probing
 * `kill(pid, 0)` and stealing on ESRCH. That scheme had two holes the kernel
 * closes for free:
 *   - **PID reuse.** A recycled pid makes a dead holder look alive, so the waiter
 *     refuses to steal and blocks until the cap.
 *   - **Liveness is not progress.** The timer keeps stamping for as long as the
 *     event loop turns, so a build wedged on a hung child looked perfectly
 *     healthy — the freshness stamp proved only that the process existed.
 * Every other cross-process mutex in the repo (push, cpu, db-fork,
 * worktree-mutate) was already on flock; this was the last holdout.
 *
 * The lock file is NEVER unlinked — release is just `closeSync`. Unlinking is
 * what let the old `release()` (which had no ownership check) remove a
 * *successor's* lock; with the fd as the lock there is nothing to mis-delete.
 * The lock file is gitignored, so leaving it behind is free.
 *
 * The holder's pid is written into the file for DIAGNOSTICS and PATIENCE only.
 * Whether the lock is held is the kernel's answer alone; the pid only picks
 * which holder the caller's `observeHolder` describes, i.e. how long to keep
 * waiting. A misleading pid can at worst produce a misleading message or an
 * `unknown` observation — which falls back to the plain `capMs` bound.

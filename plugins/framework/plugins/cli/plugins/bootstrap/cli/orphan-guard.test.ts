/**
 * The guard's decision is "has this process been reparented", read from
 * `process.ppid` on a 2s poll. These tests cover the two edges that are cheap to
 * get wrong and expensive to discover in production — arming at all, and
 * disarming for a command that is MEANT to be detached — without waiting on real
 * poll ticks. The end-to-end reparent behaviour is verified by orphaning a real
 * `./singularity` invocation, which no unit test can stand in for.

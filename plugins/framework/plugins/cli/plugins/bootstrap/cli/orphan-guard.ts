// is gone. macOS has no PDEATHSIG, so a child cannot ask the kernel to signal it
// when its parent dies — poll ppid instead (reparented orphans get ppid 1). The
// push mutex is the worst case: one serialized slot host-wide, so a single
// orphan-hold stalls every agent's push. Run onOrphan when reparented; unref so
// the timer never itself keeps the process alive.
//
// ARMED FOR EVERY COMMAND, and that is the whole design. This used to be armed
// only for a hardcoded {build, check, push} set matched against
// `process.argv[2]` in `bin/index.ts`, before any flag parsing — the last thing
// coupling the bootstrap to a list of command names. A CLI whose commands are
// plugin contributions cannot keep such a list: the bootstrap runs BEFORE the
// install, so it cannot load the declarations that would tell it, and a second
// hand-maintained copy would only be as good as the check holding it in sync.
//
// Arming unconditionally deletes the question. The cost is one unref'd 2s timer
// on commands that finish in seconds; the benefit is that a NEW command is
// guarded by default rather than by remembering to enlist it, and that the
// window is now covered for the whole process — install included, which is where
// an orphan could previously sit on the one lock every other CLI invocation in
// this checkout queues behind.
//
// The safe default being ON means the opt-out is the declared exception: see
// `detachable` in `core/internal/command.ts` and `disarmOrphanGuard` below.

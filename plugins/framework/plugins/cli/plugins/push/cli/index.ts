/**
 * The only sanctioned way work reaches `main`. Everything the verb implies —
 * the commit, the rebase, the generated-artifact re-derivation, the tree-scoped
 * check pass, the fast-forward merge — happens inside `run.ts`, serialized
 * host-wide by the `push` pool so two agents can never race on main.
 *
 * The declaration itself is data, so `./singularity --help` and every other
 * invocation pay for this file alone; the body (and the host-admission, worktree
 * and profiler barrels it reaches) loads only when a push actually runs.

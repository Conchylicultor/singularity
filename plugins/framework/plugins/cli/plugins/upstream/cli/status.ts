 * `./singularity upstream status` — what upstream has that you do not.

 * Read-only: it fetches (otherwise the count would be measured against however
 * old the remote-tracking ref on disk happens to be) and touches nothing else.
 *
 * "There is no upstream" and "you are up to date" are answers, so they exit 0.
 * Not being able to REACH upstream is not an answer, so it exits 1 — but in
 * plain words, with no stack and no crash record. A laptop on a train is not an
 * incident.

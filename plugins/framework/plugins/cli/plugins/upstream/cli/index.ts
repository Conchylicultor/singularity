/**
 * `./singularity upstream status|merge` — the repo this checkout was cloned
 * from, read and (on request) merged in.
 *
 * A GROUP, like `db` and `deploy`: it routes and never runs, and the
 * declaration union makes "also runs" unspellable, so bare `upstream` prints
 * its subcommand help by construction.
 *
 * The command exists so the mechanical half of taking an update is ONE tested
 * path instead of prose an agent re-derives each time it is handed the job —
 * the same reason `toolchain upgrade` is a command rather than a checklist.
 *
 * The declaration is data; both bodies sit behind their own lazy `import()`,
 * so every other `./singularity` invocation pays for this file alone.

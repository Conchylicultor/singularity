# Web

The SPA composition root. This plugin is **only** bootstrap — it owns the React
entry point and the HTML shell the frontend build composes from, and nothing
else. (The build itself is owned by
[`framework/tooling/web-artifacts`](../tooling/plugins/web-artifacts/CLAUDE.md);
no build config lives here any more.) No SSR, no SEO concerns.

The foundational UI layer (the `cn()` util, the shadcn/ui primitives, the global
`theme/app.css` stylesheet, and the `ControlSize` affordance-sizing context) used
to live here behind an ambient `@/*` alias. It now lives in its own boundary-legal
plugin, [`primitives/ui-kit`](../../../primitives/plugins/ui-kit/CLAUDE.md);
consumers import `@plugins/primitives/plugins/css/plugins/ui-kit/web`. The `@/*` alias has been
deleted, so a stray `@/` import is now an unresolved-module error at build time.

## Stack

- **Vite** — the underlying bundler, driven programmatically per plugin by the
  web-artifacts pipeline (no `vite.config.ts` lives here)
- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin; the global stylesheet
  (`app.css`) lives in `primitives/ui-kit` and is imported from `web/main.tsx`.
- **react-icons** — Icons (predominantly `react-icons/md`; not Lucide)

## Structure

- `web/` — SPA bootstrap only
  - `App.tsx` / `main.tsx` / `index.html` — the React entry + plugin loader
  - `components/plugin-load-errors.tsx` — boot-error surface
  - `__tests__/` — render smoke tests
  - `public/` — static assets

## Commands

Always go through `./singularity build` from the repo root.

### The frontend build

`./singularity build` composes the frontend as **per-plugin web artifacts**, and
that is now the only mode — the monolithic Vite build (and with it
`vite.config.ts`, `--monolith`, `--artifacts`, `SINGULARITY_WEB_MONOLITH`,
`SINGULARITY_WEB_ARTIFACTS`) was removed once release builds moved onto the same
pipeline. This plugin therefore carries no build config of its own; it is the
source root (`web/index.html`, `web/main.tsx`, `web/public/`) the pipeline
composes from.

Each plugin's `web/` barrel (plus every statically or dynamically imported folder
barrel — `core`, `fixtures`, …) builds into an independent, content-addressed
ES-module artifact; the browser composes them via an inline import map in
`dist/index.html`. Only changed plugins rebuild (typical warm step: a few
seconds). Artifacts are stored in `~/.singularity/web-artifacts/` (`store/`
per-plugin artifacts, `vendors/` npm pre-bundles, `css/` cached global Tailwind
passes, `fingerprints/` stat caches), shared across all worktrees, pruned by age.
A **served** dist symlinks into that store; a **release** dist is composed with
`materialize: true`, so its `artifacts/` are real copies and the bundle is
self-contained. Guarded by the `web-artifacts:map-in-sync` and
`web-artifacts:no-vendored-state-inlined` checks; engine lives in
[`framework/tooling/web-artifacts`](../tooling/plugins/web-artifacts/CLAUDE.md).
`--no-minify` skips esbuild minification for debugging (hash input).

### Eager boot bytes

The frontend boot cost is dominated by the **eager set**. In artifact mode that
set is exactly the entry artifact plus the eager tier's `modulepreload` closure —
computed by `computePreloadClosure` in web-artifacts' `core/internal/compose.ts`
and written into `dist/index.html` as `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags, seeded
from the entry, the registry, and every non-deferred web target. That closure IS
the lever: moving a plugin into the deferred tier is what removes its bytes from
boot.

To see what a boot actually costs:

```bash
# the eager URL set of a deployed dist
grep -oE '(src|href)="/artifacts/[^"]*"' ~/.singularity/worktrees/<name>/web/index.html
```

- **Debug → Boot Profile** — the request → first-paint timeline with the
  per-resource wait/work split, plus a browsable list of saved snapshots.
- The **`client-boot` trace lane** on a slow page-load trace
  (`plugins/debug/plugins/trace/plugins/client-boot/`) carries the per-asset
  rollup: what the browser actually fetched, and how much of it was trimmed.

**There is no treemap.** The `VITE_ANALYZE` / `rollup-plugin-visualizer` report
died with the monolith and has no artifact-mode equivalent — chunk composition is
not a meaningful question when each plugin is its own artifact. The two surfaces
above measure real loads instead of predicted ones; nothing reconstructs the
"what is inside this chunk" view.

**Never namespace-import a big icon package.** A dynamic or `import * as` namespace
import of `react-icons/md` (`mdModule[key]`) forces Rollup to retain *every* icon
(the package is un-tree-shakeable through a namespace) and, because hundreds of
barrels also import named icons eagerly, drags the whole ~2 MB set onto the eager
boot path (once measured at **417 KB gzip = 62 % of the entry chunk**). Import
named icons (`import { MdFoo }`) so tree-shaking keeps only the used union, or render
stored `SvgNode` data (see `primitives/icon-picker`). Enforced by the
`icon-safety/no-namespace-react-icons` lint rule; the sole exemption is the
build-time `gen-icon-svg-map.ts` (never bundled).

The eager-cost surfaces for this are the **Debug → Boot Profile** pane (the
request→first-paint *timeline*), the Boot Gantt, and the `client-boot` trace
lane's per-asset rollup.

### Tests

The vitest DOM suites here (`web/__tests__/`) need the browser stack (jsdom + the `@plugins` alias + `.css` imports + React rendering), which `bun:test` can't provide. They are discovered and run by the **repo-wide** vitest project (root `vitest.config.ts` + `test/setup.ts`), not a per-plugin config — see the root `CLAUDE.md` Testing section. One suite lives here: `plugin-render.test.tsx` (full plugin-graph load smoke).

`plugin-render.test.tsx` is a **load-only smoke**: it asserts `loadPlugins(webEntries)` returns zero errors and every contribution is structurally well-formed. It does not render contributions — a contribution needs its slot's props/context, so bare rendering is meaningless. Run from the repo root (optional):

```bash
bun run test:dom                                                              # whole DOM suite
bun run test:dom plugins/framework/plugins/web-core/web/__tests__/plugin-render.test.tsx   # one file
```

 * `./singularity deps …` — prewarm, inspect, clean up and upgrade optional

 * generated declaration registry and run the host-only engine directly — no
 * backend is booted; install uses the same `ensureDep` a supervised job does.
 * `upgrade` boots this checkout's backend in `exec` mode, because updaters are
 * still server contributions.

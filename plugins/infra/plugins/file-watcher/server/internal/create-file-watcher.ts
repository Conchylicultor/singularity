// `@parcel/watcher` is loaded LAZILY (dynamic import inside createFileWatcher),
// never at module top-level. It pulls in a native `.node` addon that a static
// import would evaluate the instant ANY module transitively imports this file —
// including barrels (e.g. config_v2/server) that merely re-export an unrelated
// symbol. In a `bun build`/`--compile` bundle that native load throws (addons
// aren't bundleable), and the throw aborts the importing barrel's module-init
// PART-WAY, leaving its other exports (e.g. `ConfigV2`) undefined — which then
// surfaces far away as "ConfigV2.Register is undefined". Deferring the load to
// the point a watcher is actually started keeps the import side-effect-free, so
// a release that never starts a watcher never touches the addon, and one that
// does fails loudly at the call site (not during an unrelated barrel's init).
//
// In a self-contained release `bun --compile` cannot embed the native addon, so
// the launcher vendors it on disk and points `SINGULARITY_PARCEL_WATCHER_NODE`
// at the absolute path of the `watcher.node` binding. When that env var is set,
// `getParcelWatcher()` dlopens the vendored binding directly and wraps it with
// parcel's own `createWrapper`, yielding the identical public API. This single
// loader is the only sanctioned entry point for `@parcel/watcher`; all consumers
// must route through it so the release vendoring path is honored.

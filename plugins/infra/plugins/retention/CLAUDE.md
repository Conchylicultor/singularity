# retention

Bounds unbounded-growth ("firehose") sinks — DB tables AND files. A sink's growth
bound is a **closed union of three constructors**, and all three are TRUE by
construction — there is no "declared but unbounded" state to represent, so there
is nothing to check for. The bad states are unrepresentable; the one claim that
cannot be made unrepresentable (this FK really cascades) throws at boot.

The registry is keyed by a `SinkKey` — `` `table:${name}` `` for a DB table,
`` `file:${id}` `` for a file sink — so a table and a file may share a bare name
without colliding.

- **`defineRetention(spec)`** — a thin wrapper over `defineJob` that schedules a
  nightly `DELETE ... WHERE <column> < now() - ttlDays [AND <where>]` sweep.
  Mirrors the hand-rolled precedents (`debug.trace-cleanup`,
  `attachments.orphan-sweep`); generalizes them so a table gets a retention
  policy in one line. Records a `{kind:"ttl"}` bound — but only when mounted.
- **`markCascadeBounded(table, owner)`** — asserts, synchronously at module eval,
  that `table` has an FK `onDelete: "cascade"` to `owner` (so deleting an owner
  row reclaims the children), then records a `{kind:"cascade", owner}` bound. If
  the cascade does not exist it **throws at boot**.
- **`rotate` (files)** — a file sink's own `bound` (`{kind:"rotate",maxBytes,keep}`
  from `@plugins/infra/plugins/file-sink/server`). It is NOT declared here at all:
  `append()` IS the rotation (see `../file-sink/CLAUDE.md`), so a *registered* sink
  is a *rotated* (bounded) sink — true by construction exactly like the other two.
  `getGrowthBounds` MERGES these in from `getFileSinks()` on read rather than
  routing them through `declareGrowthBound`. The edge is **`retention → file-sink`,
  one way**: file-sink must stay a leaf the CLI can import without dragging
  `db`/`jobs` in through this module, so file-sink never imports retention.
- **`getGrowthBounds()`** — a copy of the `Map<SinkKey, GrowthBound>`, merging the
  declared `table:` bounds with every registered `file:` sink. Its only consumer is
  the deferred undeclared-growth monitor (a separate follow-up task), which uses it
  as a *silencing* set — which is exactly why every entry must be true (mounted for
  `ttl`, FK-verified for `cascade`, rotation-by-construction for `rotate`), never
  merely declared.

## `defineRetention`

```ts
import { defineRetention } from "@plugins/infra/plugins/retention/server";
import { _reports } from "./internal/tables";

export const reportsRetention = defineRetention({
  table: _reports,       // PgTable; its name derives the job id `retention.<table>`
  column: "createdAt",   // timestamp column (default "createdAt")
  ttlDays: 7,            // rows older than this are deleted
  cron: "0 4 * * *",     // 5-field UTC (default nightly 04:00)
  perWorktree: true,     // sweep runs in every worktree DB fork (default false = main-only)
  where: eq(_reports.pinned, false), // optional extra scope AND-ed onto the age predicate
});
```

It returns the same `JobFactory` `defineJob` returns — mount it on the consumer
`ServerPluginDefinition` via `register: [reportsRetention]`. The plugin itself
mounts nothing; it is a pure API provider.

**`perWorktree`.** Default `false` (main-only), matching `ScheduleSpec`. Set
`true` only for tables that live in the **per-worktree DB fork** (`_reports`,
`entity_versions`) — a table in the shared/main DB must stay main-only so N live
worktrees don't race N sweeps over the same rows.

The DELETE predicate is `column < cutoff` — **strict**, so a row exactly at the
cutoff instant is kept. `cutoff` is recomputed each tick (not captured at define
time). A missing `column` throws loudly at `defineRetention` call time.

## Coverage ⇔ mounted, by construction (G1)

`defineRetention` records the `{kind:"ttl"}` bound **inside the returned
factory's `register()`**, next to the wrapped `defineJob(...).register()` — never
at call time. A `JobFactory` only becomes a live sweep when the consumer puts it
in `register: [...]`; recording the bound anywhere else would let a policy that is
*defined but never mounted* (its sweep silently never runs) still claim coverage.
By writing the bound only in `register()`, the two facts — "the sweep is
scheduled" and "the table is recorded as bounded" — happen in the same call or
not at all. Forgetting `register: [x]` leaves the table in the same state as never
writing the code: no false coverage, no lying registry. This is the
"failure must never masquerade as a legitimate value" rule applied to the
registry itself.

## `markCascadeBounded` — verify the cascade where the truth lives (G2)

A table whose rows are reclaimed by an FK cascade needs no TTL sweep, but the
claim "this FK really cascades" must be checked, not trusted. `markCascadeBounded`
reads `getTableConfig(table).foreignKeys` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` — a
synchronous, DB-free read of the drizzle table object — and requires an FK with
`onDelete: "cascade"` whose `reference().foreignTable` is `owner`. On violation it
throws, naming the table, the owner, and every FK actually found (name +
`onDelete` + target).

- Reading the **drizzle declaration** (not `pg_constraint`) is correct and needs
  no DB: `migrations-in-sync` already guarantees `tables.ts` ↔ committed
  migrations, so the declaration *is* the schema. Dropping the `onDelete:
  "cascade"` in a later edit makes the next boot fail at the `markCascadeBounded`
  call.
- Naming the `owner` explicitly (rather than a bare boolean flag) is what makes
  the claim checkable at all, and keeps it greppable.

**This runs at MODULE EVAL of the consumer** — boot's import phase — so a
violation is boot-fatal. `./singularity build` probes backend health after
restart and fails loudly ("Check server logs") when the new backend never takes
over, so a bad cascade claim surfaces as a failed build, not a silently-dead app.
Precedent for a throwing boot invariant of exactly this shape:
`plugins/database/plugins/change-feed/server/internal/identity-coverage.ts`.

## Why there is no `./singularity check`

An earlier design had a `retention:firehose-bounded` check over a string-keyed
registry. It was deleted: `./singularity check` runs in a standalone process that
never loads server modules, so the registry was empty (and non-deterministically
so under a full pass), and its only representable failure — a firehose declared
with no bound — became **unrepresentable** once growth-bound declaration
collapsed to the two always-true constructors above. The FK-cascade claim, which
a name-only check genuinely could not verify, is instead verified in-process at
module eval, where the drizzle table object is in hand. Making the bad states
unrepresentable and throwing on the one residual claim is the structural fix; a
check would have been a patch on a footgun.

## Boundaries

- `server/` — the whole plugin (owns all drizzle + `db` usage):
  - `internal/define-retention.ts` — `defineRetention` (bound recorded in
    `register()`).
  - `internal/assert-cascade.ts` — `markCascadeBounded` + the pure `findCascadeFk`
    probe (barrel-private; exported only for its test).
  - `internal/growth-bounds.ts` — the `GrowthBound` union, the `SinkKey`-keyed
    process-global registry (`declareGrowthBound`, `getGrowthBounds`), and the
    read-time merge of `file-sink`'s registered sinks. Server-private now that no
    standalone check reads it.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Retention primitive: defineRetention wraps defineJob into a nightly TTL sweep (DELETE WHERE column < now()-ttl) whose growth bound is recorded only when the sweep is mounted; markCascadeBounded verifies at module eval that an FK onDelete cascade really reclaims the rows. getGrowthBounds exposes the resulting true set of growth bounds.
- Server:
  - Uses: `database.db`, `infra/file-sink.getFileSinks`, `infra/jobs.defineJob`, `infra/jobs.JobFactory`
  - Exports: Types: `GrowthBound`, `RetentionJob`, `RetentionSpec`, `SinkKey`; Values: `defineRetention`, `getGrowthBounds`, `markCascadeBounded`
- Cross-plugin:
  - Imported by: `debug/boot-profile`, `debug/slow-ops`, `debug/trace/engine`, `history/engine`, `infra/trash`, `reports`

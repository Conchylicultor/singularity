// Verify — at MODULE EVAL of the consumer — that a table's unbounded growth is
// really reclaimed by an FK `onDelete: "cascade"` to a named owner, then record
// the bound. Reading the drizzle table object is synchronous and DB-free:
// `getTableConfig(table).foreignKeys[].onDelete` / `.reference().foreignTable`
// are the schema declaration itself, and `migrations-in-sync` already guarantees
// that declaration matches the committed migrations. So a false claim (or a later
// edit that drops the `onDelete: "cascade"`) is caught by boot, not a DB probe.
//
// "Module eval of the consumer" = boot's import phase, so a violation is
// BOOT-FATAL. `./singularity build` probes backend health after restart and fails
// loudly ("Check server logs") when the new backend never takes over — so a bad
// cascade claim surfaces as a failed build, not a silently-dead app. This mirrors
// the precedent in change-feed's `assertScopePoliciesCovered` (a throwing boot
// invariant that a static `./singularity check` cannot express).

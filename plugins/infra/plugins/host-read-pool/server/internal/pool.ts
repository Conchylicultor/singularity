/**
 * Admit `fn` to the two-tier heavy-read gate.
 *
 * `signal` is optional and ambient: pass a job handler's `ctx.signal` (or an
 * enclosing request's) and an abort stops the caller waiting for a slot, throwing
 * `signal.reason`. Threaded into BOTH tiers, but they cancel with different
 * sharpness, and the difference is worth knowing rather than papering over:
 *
 *  - The HOST tier honours it properly (`AcquireHooks.signal`): a pending flock
 *    acquire unwinds, and an abort while `fn` runs releases the host slot without
 *    waiting for `fn` to settle. That is the tier that matters, because it is the
 *    one holding a resource every other backend on the box shares.
 *  - The LOCAL tier — `createSemaphore`, an in-process counter+queue — takes no
 *    signal, by design (its consumers elsewhere are request-scoped leases, and the
 *    one case that motivated adding one was deleted). So an abort that lands while
 *    we are queued LOCALLY is not observed until the local gate grants; we then
 *    throw at the top of the body below rather than going on to take a host slot
 *    for a caller that has been written off. The exposure is bounded by the local
 *    queue, which holds nothing host-wide.

/**

 * The child's streams are redirected to temp-file fds (raw numeric fds — a
 * plain kernel dup2, zero JS stream machinery in either direction) and read
 * back after exit. No stream, no pending pull promise, nothing for bun
 * 1.3.13's exit-during-pull race to wedge. stdin, when given, is a whole
 * buffer delivered the same way (a temp file opened for read).
 *
 * A non-zero exit is a RESULT, not an error — callers that treat it as fatal
 * use `spawnExpectOk`. Temp files orphaned by a hard crash are reclaimed by
 * the OS tmpdir sweep (repo convention).
 *
 * `opts` is REQUIRED and its type is a union, so every caller has to say what
 * bounds this child — `timeoutMs`, `signal`, or the prose `unbounded` opt-out.
 * See `SpawnOptions` for how to choose between the three.
 *
 * `opts.timeoutMs` is a one-shot deadline (see `SpawnBound`): SIGTERM on expiry,
 * SIGKILL after `SIGKILL_GRACE_MS`, `timedOut: true` on the result. Whatever the
 * child wrote before the kill is still captured — the temp files are read after
 * exit either way.
 *
 * `opts.signal` runs the SAME escalation but THROWS `signal.reason` instead of
 * returning a result, so an abandoned caller cannot absorb the cancellation and
 * carry on (see `SpawnBound.signal` for why the two differ).
 *
 * `opts.unbounded` is read by NOTHING here. It is a type-level and grep-level
 * artifact only, and this function behaves exactly as it did before bounds
 * existed when that is the arm chosen.

/**
 * Wedge-breaker for the two `git rev-parse` reads below, not latency policing.
 * Both are metadata-only and sample in single-digit ms, so ~60 s is three
 * orders of magnitude of headroom — deliberately, because what these commands
 * actually suffer is STARVATION rather than slowness, and starvation is not
 * bounded by the p99 of an idle box. `infra/worktree`'s `worktree.ts` carries
 * the measurement this is copied from, including the finding that a 10 s bound
 * on the same class of command still false-fired during a real
 * `./singularity check`, where every parallel type-check worker calls in at once.
 *
 * The extra reason to be generous HERE: the memo caches rejections on purpose,
 * so a spurious timeout would not fail one caller, it would fail every caller
 * in the process for the rest of its life.

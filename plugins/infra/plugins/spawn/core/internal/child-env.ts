// Every child this primitive starts runs with git's optional locks OFF.
//
// A git READ is not lock-free by default: `git status`, `git diff` and friends
// refresh the index's cached file stats and write them back, briefly holding
// `.git/index.lock` to do it. In a checkout shared by several processes that
// turns a read into a collision with a real write: main's auto-build runs
// `git status` in main's checkout while a queued `./singularity push` runs
// `git merge --ff-only` there, and the merge fails outright on
// "index.lock: File exists" (seven failed pushes, Sep 16–22 2026).
//
// `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` tells git to skip exactly those opportunistic writes;
// commands that must write (merge, add, commit, update-index) still take the
// lock as before. Set here, at the one chokepoint every runtime's async spawns
// go through, so no read we issue can take the lock, whoever writes the call.
// The cost is the stat cache not being saved by reads, which the next real
// index write refreshes anyway.

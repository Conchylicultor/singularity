 *
 * Both members are optional HERE, because `SpawnOptions` below is the union
 * that makes at least one of them (or the explicit `unbounded` opt-out)
 * unavoidable. This interface stays the plain "just the bound" bag so a wrapper
 * that forwards a bound it was handed can keep taking it as one parameter.

   * whenever the CALLER owns a deadline it must honor (an HTTP request that

   *
   * The asymmetry with `timeoutMs` (result field) is deliberate. `timeoutMs` is
   * the caller's OWN deadline, so the caller is the right place to classify it.
   * An abort is ambient — "everything you are doing has been abandoned" — and a
   * result field would be absorbed: a caller whose `catch`/branch maps a failed
   * probe to a conservative default would swallow it and then go on to do a
   * hundred more spawns after being told to stop. That is the absorbed-failure
   * pattern the repo bans, so the abort is a throw the caller cannot mistake for
   * a value. It also means `spawnExpectOk` needs no special case: the abort
   * propagates before the exit-code check, so it is never mis-reported as
   * `SpawnFailedError`.
   *
   * `signal.reason` is rethrown as-is (the standard `AbortSignal` contract), not
   * wrapped in a fresh error, so whoever aborted can attach context that surfaces
   * at the wedge site.
   *
   * Two edges worth knowing:
   * - **Abort beats `timedOut`.** If both fire, in either order, the call
   *   throws; it never returns a `timedOut: true` result.
   * - **An abort after a clean exit still throws**, discarding a good result.
   *   Correct — the caller was told to stop before it was handed the value — but
   *   surprising if you expect "the work finished, so it counts".

 * cancellation it obeys (`signal`), or — in prose — why nothing bounds it
 * (`unbounded`). There is nothing to remember and nothing to enforce elsewhere;
 * `tsc` rejects the unbounded wait at the call site (rung 2 of the fix ladder).
 *
 * The gate for requiring this flipped. `spawn/CLAUDE.md` used to set the
 * criterion as "the absence of an observed field wedge, diagnosed by hand", and
 * a field wedge has now been observed TWICE — including the 2026-08-17 outage,
 * where an unbounded `git worktree remove` held the host-wide `worktree-mutate`
 * flock and stopped worktree checkouts on every backend on the box. Nothing else
 * catches this: the fleet-level op-wedge watchdog was retired 2026-07-28 as an
 * all-false-positive instrument, so an unbounded hung child hangs until a human
 * notices.
 *
 * Pick the arm from what actually bounds the work — never a blanket number:
 *
 * - **`timeoutMs`** when the caller owns a deadline (an HTTP request, a job
 *   handler, a reaper holding a host-wide slot). Size it to the command; the
 *   named per-operation constants in `infra/worktree`'s `worktree.ts` are the
 *   house style, and their calibration comment is worth reading before guessing
 *   a number — these are WEDGE-BREAKERS, so far above p99, not latency police.
 * - **`signal`** when the caller already holds one (a job handler's
 *   `ctx.signal`), alone or together with `timeoutMs` — a class deadline and a
 *   per-command ceiling are different facts and both can be true.
 * - **`unbounded`** only where nothing shorter than the work bounds it. The
 *   value is a SENTENCE saying why, not a flag: prose cannot be copy-pasted
 *   without reading it, and `rg "unbounded:"` enumerates every one of them in a
 *   form a reviewer can actually audit. It has NO runtime effect whatsoever —
 *   it exists to be typed and to be grepped.

/**
 * The Chromium every browser launch in the repo runs: `browserFetch` and the
 * prototype thumbnails (request / job paths: `readyNow` + `requestDep`), the
 * layout-geometry check and the e2e harness (`ensureDepViaCli`). Declared here
 * because the primitive that needs it at run time owns it — a backend's
 * correctness must not depend on a tooling plugin's declaration.
 *
 * On demand: nothing downloads it at `bun install`. The first thing that needs
 * it installs it (~280 MB) into the deps cache, once per machine per
 * `playwright-core` version.

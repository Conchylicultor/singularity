 * **name-based**, not `instanceof`-based: the error crosses a plugin boundary
 * and may cross a module-instance boundary with it, and a name comparison
 * survives both. `kind` is the machine-readable half; the message is the
 * human-readable one.
 *
 * Note what this class deliberately does NOT wrap: `SsrfError`. A refusal to
 * reach a private address propagates unwrapped, so a caller that already
 * classifies `SsrfError` as terminal keeps classifying it identically whether
 * the read went through `safeFetch` or through a browser. Wrapping it would
 * silently downgrade a terminal security refusal into an anonymous transient.

// be identical in every backend — a process sized to 1 only sweeps `slot-0` and
// is blind to one holding `slot-1`, silently exceeding the bound. That is why
// this pool's size is a CONSTANT rather than a function of `cpus()` (precedent:
// `db-fork`): a browser launch costs about the same on every box.

// reads genuinely nest (the warmup executor wraps a warm-up that itself parses
// files under the same gate), and with a local tier of 2 the nested acquire
// deadlocked on a gate only its own holder could free. A browser fetch never
// nests in a browser fetch: the body is launch → navigate → serialize → close,
// which calls nothing that could re-enter this gate. Do not copy the ALS block
// across "for symmetry" — it would add an ambient global to guard a shape that
// cannot occur.

 * what costs the host — but NOT across URL validation, which happens before
 * admission so a refusal never queues behind someone else's render.
 *
 * Each tier charges its wait distinctly to the enclosing entry, so a slow render
 * reads as queue-vs-work rather than one opaque number.

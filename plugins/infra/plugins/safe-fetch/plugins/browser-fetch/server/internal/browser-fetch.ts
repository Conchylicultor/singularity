 *
 * Same contract as `safeFetch` in the one way that matters: a target can never
 * reach a loopback / private / link-local / metadata address. It gets there by a
 * different route — Chromium's `--host-resolver-rules` pins DNS at LAUNCH, and
 * every intercepted request is re-guarded with `parsePublicUrl` — which is why
 * this is a sub-plugin of `safe-fetch` rather than a peer.

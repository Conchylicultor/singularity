// The `claude-web/<attemptId>` branch convention, in both directions, as the ONE
// definition of it.
//
// Why this lives in `core/` and not next to `setupWorktree`, which is the only
// thing that ever CREATES such a branch: the branch outlives the checkout.
// `git worktree remove` deletes the directory and leaves `refs/heads/claude-web/<id>`
// standing, so the branch is the last durable trace of a reaped attempt — the only
// place its unpushed commits can still be measured, and the string a recovery
// message tells the user to run `git worktree add` against. It is therefore read by
// far more code than writes it, and read from the browser as often as from the
// server (a Gantt row label, an op detail title). Every reader that spells the
// prefix itself is a place the convention can silently drift out of step with the
// writer.
//
// Web-safe by construction, for that reason: string literals only, no `node:*`, no
// import of the sibling `server/` tree. Same rule, and same reason, as
// `infra/paths/display`.

// A per-op, crash-safe liveness marker for a long-running operation (build,
// push, check, test, e2e — the `OpKind` vocabulary declared once in this
// plugin's core). It answers exactly one question: "is this op's process still
// running?" What the op is DOING (queued, parked on a wait, working) is the op
// log's business — the marker carries no phase.
//
// The file is `worktrees/<slug>/ops/<opId>.json` = {v:2, kind, opId, pid,
// startedAt}, and its writer holds a kernel `flock` on it for the op's whole
// life. The lock IS the liveness: the kernel drops it when the process dies —
// SIGKILL, OOM and power loss included — and no pid is ever consulted, so pid
// reuse cannot make a dead op look alive. A reader probes with a non-blocking
// try-lock: failing to take it ⇒ the op is running; taking it ⇒ the writer is
// gone, and the reader reaps the file.
//
// One file per op (not per (worktree, kind)): two checks in one worktree are two
// markers, so neither overwrites the other and every reader sees both.
//
// Consumers: the tmux status reconciler (a pane in the CLI "shell" state reads
// as `working` only while one of these is live for its worktree — woken by the
// per-slug touch in `opSignalsDir`, see `touchOpSignal`), `./singularity
// await`, the stop guard, and the op-store orphan reconciler. Markers are keyed
// on the checkout's namespace, which every writer (`build` / `push` / direct
// ops) and reader agrees on.

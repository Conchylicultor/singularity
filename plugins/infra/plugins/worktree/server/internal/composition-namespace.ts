// Namespace ownership: who may claim `worktrees/<ns>/`, and the provenance
// marker that records who did.
//
// A namespace is `<composition>.<checkout>` with both sentinels elided
// (`@plugins/infra/plugins/namespace/core`), so a SINGLE label is ambiguous:
// `foo` could be composition `foo` on main, or the main composition on checkout
// `foo`. That ambiguity is inherent to any encoding that preserves today's URLs,
// so it is PREVENTED here rather than decoded downstream.
//
// And it is not merely an ambiguous URL. Both claimants would resolve to the
// same spec dir, the same socket and the same Postgres database — a data
// collision. So the rule is SYMMETRIC refusal: whichever side tries to claim an
// already-occupied namespace fails loudly, composition or checkout. Neither wins.
//
// Single-sourced here (rather than inside the CLI bin) so the build-time
// compose-serve stage, the runtime reset endpoint and worktree creation all
// consume the exact same safety-critical logic; a marker-name or collision-rule
// change can never drift between them.

/**
 * Stamp the provenance marker for a compose-serve namespace, and PROVE it

 * The writer lives here, next to the readers and next to the filename itself,
 * because it started life as a private copy inside the build CLI: one module
 * spelled the path to write it and another spelled the path to read it, which
 * is the drift this plugin exists to prevent. Nothing outside can name the file.
 *
 * ATOMIC (temp + rename). A torn marker reads as a foreign dir and would fail
 * the namespace-collision guard forever.
 *
 * VERIFIED. The write is followed by a read-back, and a marker that is not on
 * disk afterwards throws. A silent no-op here is not cosmetic: the marker is the
 * only proof the namespace is a served composition, so its absence makes the
 * next build of the same composition REFUSE the namespace (`namespaceCollision`
 * reads a marker-less dir as foreign), makes the Serve status report a live
 * composition as not served, and makes Reset refuse it. Missing provenance is a
 * permanently-stuck namespace, so it fails loudly at the instant it is written
 * rather than at the next build, in another process, a day later.
 *
 * CALL IT AGAIN AT THE COMMIT POINT. Claiming the namespace up front is not
 * enough on its own: a build spends most of its wall time waiting for a host CPU
 * grant, and the namespace dir is a shared-filesystem location that can be
 * removed while it waits — this is not hypothetical, it is what happened on
 * 2026-08-19 (dir created 19:42:38, gone before 19:57:31, recreated by the dist
 * compose). Every other artifact in that dir is (re)written at the end of the
 * build and so healed itself; the marker was written only in the prefix and did
 * not. So the marker is stamped twice: once to CLAIM the dir before anything
 * else writes into it, and once as part of the COMMIT that makes the namespace
 * live. The second write carries the same bytes, so in the normal case it
 * changes nothing.

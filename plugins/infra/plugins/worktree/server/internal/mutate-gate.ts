// A DEDICATED host-wide gate for heavy `git worktree add`/`remove` — deliberately
// SEPARATE from `heavy-read` (infra/host-read-pool), not a reuse of it:
//
// - `heavy-read` bounds cheap-ish interactive READS (edited-files, commits-graph,
//   code navigation). A worktree mutation is a heavy WRITE (a ~3.8 s / 77 MB /
//   8385-file checkout, or a ~1.2 s full-tree `rm`). Routing a 3.8 s write through
//   the read gate would head-of-line-block interactive reads behind it — the exact
//   opposite of what we want. Two independent budgets keep read latency and write
//   throughput decoupled.
//
// This gate is a BOUNDARY INVARIANT + containment, not the cost-axis cure: it bounds
// how many full-tree checkouts/removes run at once across ALL worktree backends (the
// spawn job, the reap, manual deletes, and staging-land all live in different
// processes, so only a cross-process flock semaphore can bound them). It is the
// backstop that keeps the box in the flat region — K≤4 concurrent adds stay
// ~baseline, K≥6 degrades ~+75 %/op and drives a +141 % foreground slowdown under a
// 6-way churn. The irreducible per-op cost (the 77 MB working tree) is a separate,
// deeper lever (sparse-checkout). See
// research/perfs/2026-07-02-worktree-mutation-host-gate-DESIGN.md.
//
// Size + CPU cost are declared ONCE in host-admission/core's reserved-pool table
// (`max(2, floor(cpus/6))` = 3 on an 18-CPU box), so this pool and the
// `host-budget` check read the same numbers. NO env override: `size` names the
// flock SLOT FILES, so it MUST be identical in every process — a pure function of
// stable host facts is what prevents a mis-sized backend from silently exceeding
// the bound.

// The `worktree-mutate-acquire` occupancy gauge is auto-registered by
// `defineHostPool` with TRUE host-wide occupancy.
const gate = defineHostPool({ id: "worktree-mutate", size: mutateSize, cost });

// Wrap the heavy `git worktree add`/`remove` subprocess. The acquire-wait is charged
// to the enclosing profiler entry (job/http) so a saturated gate stays attributable
// in get_runtime_profile / slow-ops, mirroring host-read-pool. Context-less callers
// (graphile jobs) fall back to a standalone span inside chargeWait.

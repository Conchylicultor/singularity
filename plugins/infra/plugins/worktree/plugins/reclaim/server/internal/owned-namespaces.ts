// Who owns a namespace — asked, never enumerated.
//
// `namespaceFor` mints `<composition>.<checkout>` with both sentinels elided, and
// `composition-namespace.ts` explains why there is deliberately no inverse: a
// single label is ambiguous, so decomposing a name back into a (composition,
// checkout) pair would need the composition set at every reader. The marker
// records the pair where it is MINTED, and these two readers are the queries that
// marker exists to answer.
//
// That is the structural half of the reclaim. A caller does not name the kinds of
// namespace a checkout might have left behind; it asks what the checkout owns and
// reclaims the answer. A namespace kind invented later is reclaimed with no edit
// to any caller.

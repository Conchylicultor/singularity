// Reclaiming ONE namespace: the second half of what `reapAttempt` used to do
// inline, split out so it can be asked for by name.
//
// A namespace is four things — a Postgres database, a config dir, the gateway
// registry dir (which also holds the dist and the provenance marker), and the
// gitignored filtered registries inside whatever checkout composed it. Removing a
// checkout and reclaiming a namespace were one fused function; they are two jobs,
// and only the second one is here.
//
// This lives in its own sub-plugin rather than in `infra/worktree` because five
// CLI command files import that barrel, so anything added to it joins the CLI
// PROCESS's static import closure. Reclaiming reaches `database/admin` and
// `database/zero/.../cache-service`, and through them `infra/jobs` and the DB
// pool — a large closure to graft onto a barrel the CLI freezes at load, and
// exactly the surface `cli:codegen-manifests-not-frozen` guards.

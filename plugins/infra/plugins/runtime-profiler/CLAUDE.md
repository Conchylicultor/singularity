# runtime-profiler

In-memory, per-worktree runtime span recorder (`http` / `db` / `loader`, plus the `sub` /
`push` *origin* entries that trigger loaders). Zero-dependency and **isomorphic** (`core`
only, no Node APIs) so `core` can sit low in the DAG and be imported by `endpoints/core` and
`database/server`. The store is bounded and lost on restart.

## Caller attribution (ambient tier)

Each `db`/`loader` span records the single innermost enclosing request/loader it ran under
(its immediate `parent`), so N+1 / fan-out patterns point straight at their source — one
level only, keyed by **label** (`SpanRef` is `{kind,label}`), which is what the `byParent`
aggregate breakdown groups by. A loader triggered by a WS subscription or a push cascade
nests inside a `sub` / `push` origin entry, so its `parent` names the request class that
triggered it instead of being `null`.

Per-*instance* identity is a separate, finer axis (`id` / `parentId`, see the
flight-recorder section); `SpanRef` deliberately carries **no** id — an aggregate is a
roll-up over many runs of one label, where an instance id would be meaningless.

## Wall-clock decomposition (wait / child / self)

Every entry span decomposes its wall-clock into **`waitMs`** (time covered by named
gate/pool waits at any depth of its subtree), **`childMs`** (time covered by direct-child
entry executions), and **`selfMs`** (the remainder: its own orchestration/CPU — on a
composite span a *conservative upper bound* of own work, since untracked awaits land here).
A concurrency gate calls `chargeWait(layer, ms)` from its `onWait` callback; the interval
`[now − ms, now]` propagates to **every open ancestor entry** (innermost included) up the
live `EntryContext.parent` chain, so a composite span like a `flush` draining many loaders
names the gates its subtree waited on rather than showing huge wall-clock with empty `waits`.

The load-bearing math is the **streaming interval-union** (`Track`, per ancestor): a flush
drains loaders concurrently, so *summing* child waits into an ancestor could exceed its
wall-clock (20 loaders × 60 s gate wait inside a 90 s flush ≠ "1200 s wait"). Each ancestor
instead unions the intervals over its own timeline, guaranteeing `waitMs ≤ wall` and
`selfMs ≥ 0` at every level; per-layer `waits` values are unions too (each ≤ wall). Every
charge arrives at its interval's END (gates call `onWait` at slot acquisition; children
charge at finish), so the stream is end-ordered by construction and the O(1) streaming
union is *exact* — a non-end-ordered arrival would only undercount, never overcount. A
finished child charges its execution interval into the *nearest open ancestor only* (its
own interval propagates upward when it finishes — charging every ancestor would
double-count grandchildren); gate waits go to *all* open ancestors because unions are
idempotent under re-covering, which is what makes each level's `waits` self-contained.
Closed ancestors are never mutated (a detached child finishing late cannot corrupt a
recorded span).

### Positioned wait bands (`WaitBand`)

`Track` is the *measure* of the covered set; a **`WaitBand[]` per `(entry, layer)`** is the
covered set itself, so a wait has a *when* and not merely a *how much*. Bands are derived
from `contribute()`'s **return value** (the slice it newly covered, already clipped to that
ancestor's `startMs` and frontier), never the raw `[start, end]` — every ancestor clips the
same charge differently, which is what makes `Σ band widths === track.unionMs` true *by
construction*. End-ordered arrival (above) makes the insert a tail op: O(1), no sort.

The list is capped at `WAIT_BAND_CAP` per `(entry, layer)`; on overflow the **smallest** band
is dropped, never merged across a gap — painting time a span was not waiting would be worse
than admitting ignorance (the recorder is conservative in the *under* direction everywhere).
`waitMs` stays the authoritative cross-layer union, so a consumer derives
`residualMs = waitMs − crossLayerUnion(bands) ≥ 0` = "this much wait happened, at positions
we no longer retain". Note the *cross-layer* union: two layers can overlap in time, so their
per-layer widths **sum** to more than `waitMs`.

Bands attach to the `EntryContext` actually charged (a closed intermediate ancestor has
none) and are never reconstructed from a subtree walk — a detached child whose wait
straddles its parent's close would paint a phantom band in a parent deliberately excluded.

Reading it: a leaf loader that is mostly `waitMs` was head-of-line-blocked (the resource is
fast); mostly `selfMs` = genuinely slow. A `flush` with `childMs ≈ wall`, `waits` naming
`background-acquire`/`db-acquire`, and small `selfMs` spent its life awaiting gate-blocked
children. `waitSplit(agg)` returns the per-call averages `{ avgMs, waitMs, childMs, selfMs,
waits }` from the aggregate's summed totals.

Charging layers: `background-acquire` (background DB **query** gate), `background-tx-acquire`
(background DB **transaction** lease gate) and `db-acquire` (pg pool connect wait), all
`database/server/internal/client.ts`; `heavy-read-acquire` / `heavy-read-local`
(`infra/host/host-read-pool`); `read-admit` (resource read admission) and `read-coalesce` (joined
an in-flight resource read) (`server-core/core/resources.ts`); `endpoint-concurrency` /
`endpoint-dedupe` (per-route gates, `infra/endpoints/core/implement.ts` — the `http` entry
span encloses them, so deduped GETs record one span per request with joiners showing
`endpoint-dedupe ≈ wall`, `selfMs ≈ 0`); `git-coalesce:<name>` (joined an in-flight git
recompute) and the 0 ms markers `git-memo-hit:<name>` / `git-memo-miss:<name>`
(`infra/git/git-read-cache`). A `chargeWait` with no active entry (context-less jobs/pollers)
falls back to a standalone `db [layer]` span so the wait is never lost. See
`research/2026-07-02-global-profiler-wait-propagation.md`.

## Windowed max (`recentMaxMs` / `maxAgeMs`)

Each aggregate keeps a rolling ~5-min bucketed max: `recentMaxMs` answers "is it slow NOW"
(0 when idle past the window), while `maxMs` is the sticky since-boot peak and `maxAgeMs`
its age — so a stale spike reads as stale. `getRuntimeProfile()` sorts aggregates by
`recentMaxMs` desc. All timestamps flow through one injectable clock seam (`installClock`,
default `performance.now()`) so union/bucket arithmetic is deterministic under test
(`core/recorder.test.ts`).

The ambient context is supplied by an **injected** `SpanContextRuntime`, so the core stays
pure (no `node:async_hooks`, web bundle unaffected): `core/recorder.ts` holds a
no-op-by-default runtime + `installSpanContextRuntime(rt)`, and `server/internal/install.ts`
installs an `AsyncLocalStorage`-backed one as a module side effect (imported by the routeless
`server/index.ts`, so the registry wires it up at boot, before `Bun.serve`). The web never
imports `server/`, so on the client every entry point is a transparent passthrough.

### Entry points vs leaves

- `recordEntrySpan(kind, label, fn)` — used at the HTTP (`endpoints/core/implement.ts`),
  loader (`server-core/core/resources.ts` `wrapLoad`), origin (`server-core` `wrapOrigin`,
  for the `sub`/`push` entries), and job (`infra/plugins/jobs/server/internal/worker.ts`,
  wrapping each `job.run()` in a `job` entry span labelled by the job name) chokepoints.
  Runs `fn` under a fresh ambient `EntryContext` (chained to the live parent, with per-track
  union accumulators), while recording the entry span itself against the *outer* parent (an
  entry is never its own parent). Records in `finally`, materializing
  `waits`/`waitMs`/`childMs`/`selfMs`.
- `recordSpan(kind, label, durationMs)` — leaf path (DB pool wrapper); attributes to the
  current ambient context automatically. A leaf has no decomposition: `waitMs`/`childMs`
  default to 0, `selfMs` to the full duration.
- `chargeWait(layer, ms)` — see the decomposition section above.
- `currentCallerKind()` — the `kind` of the **innermost** enclosing entry point (or
  `undefined` when none is active). A thin read of the same ambient context; the DB pool
  wrapper uses it to decide whether to capture a query's read-set. Read it synchronously,
  before any await.
- `currentOriginClass()` — the lane (`"interactive" | "background"`) of the **outermost**
  enclosing entry, or `undefined` when none is active; the DB pool gates partition on it.
  Walks the `EntryContext.parent` chain to the root and maps `root.kind` through an
  exhaustive `Record<SpanKind, OriginClass>` (so adding a span kind is a tsc error until it
  picks a lane): `http`/`sub`/`loader` interactive, `flush`/`push`/`cascade`/`job`/
  `bg`/`route`/`membership` background. Root, not innermost, because inside a resource load the innermost kind is
  `loader` regardless of *why* the load runs. Unlike `chargeWait`, the walk does not skip
  closed ancestors (it only reads `kind`). Allocation-free; read it synchronously, before
  any await.
- `runInBackgroundLane(fn)` — declare that `fn` is background work whatever triggered it,
  overriding the origin walk. Backed by its own AsyncLocalStorage (`server/internal/install.ts`),
  so it propagates through awaited DB work — including down to the `pool.connect()` a nested
  `db.transaction()` takes. Used by the observability writers (slow-ops, reports, trace
  capture, contention), whose transactions would otherwise inherit the origin of whichever
  human request tripped them, and by the jobs worker's post-run cleanup writes, which sit
  outside the `job` entry span. Deliberately **separate** from `runWithoutProfiling`: "don't
  record" and "isn't background" are different claims — `debug/profiling/boot-bench`'s
  load-generator wants the former while deliberately holding real gate slots. See
  `research/2026-07-09-global-interactive-lane-origin-based-db-gating.md`.

### Span detail (`variant` + `measures`)

Both recording calls take an optional last argument, `SpanDetail`:
`{ variant?: string; measures?: Partial<Record<SpanMeasure, number>> }`.

- `variant` names *which instance* of the operation ran. The loader span uses it for the
  canonical params. The label stays the resource key, so one resource is still one
  aggregate / one slow-op row, and consumers break a row down by variant themselves.
  Capped at 200 chars. Never put per-call values in a **label**. That is what `variant`
  is for.
- `measures` are numbers from the closed `SPAN_MEASURES` set: `subscribers` / `frameChars`
  (on `push deliver:<key>`), `ids` (a scoped refill loader, a `route`), `sinceChangeMs`
  (a `route`). Closed like `SPAN_KINDS`, so every surface can label each one. Each
  aggregate keeps `measuresMax`: the largest value of each measure across its records.
  That makes the widest fan-out or largest frame visible even when no single span was
  slow.

An empty detail is recorded as none. `SlowSpan.detail` carries it to `onSlowSpan`
subscribers (slow-ops persists it). The flight ring does not carry it.

### Live-state plumbing kinds (`route`, `membership`)

- `route`: the change-feed routing one Postgres change into the resource runtime (label =
  the table; `change-feed/server/internal/route-span.ts`). A leaf with no parent.
- `membership`: a window resource's ids-only query (`windowIdsOf`), under its `push`
  origin (label = the resource key; the runtime's `wrapMembership`). Its own kind for the
  same reason as `cascade`: it stays out of the loader read-set index, and it is told
  apart from the value query.

The live-state HTTP fallback records as `http` `GET /api/resources/<key>` (the runtime's
`wrapHttp`), 304s included. See
`research/2026-09-23-global-live-state-plumbing-slow-op-coverage.md`.

`getRuntimeProfile()` returns each aggregate (sorted by `recentMaxMs` desc) with its
`byParent` breakdown (count desc) and summed `waitTotalMs`/`childTotalMs`/`selfTotalMs`, and
each `slowest` span with its `parent` and per-span `waitMs`/`childMs`/`selfMs`.

## Monitoring self-meter (`getSelfMeter`)

Every observability write runs inside `runWithoutProfiling`, so monitoring's own cost is
invisible to the profiler — the tool you'd reach for. So `runWithoutProfiling` **meters
itself**: everything suppressed is by definition monitoring work, so two module counters at
that one chokepoint attribute all of it with zero per-callsite edits, and being plain
numbers outside the recorder's span path they can never re-feed the profiler.

`getSelfMeter()` returns cumulative-since-boot `{ count, totalMs }`: one *op* per
**outermost** `runWithoutProfiling` scope, `totalMs` its wall-clock from call to settlement
(sync return, sync throw, or promise settle — observed on a detached derived promise, so the
original result passes through untouched and a rejection is never absorbed). A scope opened
while suppression is already active (detected via `suppressed()` itself, ALS semantics, so
it holds across awaits) adds neither count nor time — never double-counted. Two *concurrent*
outermost scopes each meter their full wall (a sum, like CPU-time accounting): separate
monitoring work items. The meter is monotonic and **never reset** (not by
`resetRuntimeProfile` either) — consumers diff successive readings, and a reset would
surface as a negative delta.

Consumer: the health sampler (`debug/health-monitor` `process-sampler.ts`) diffs it each
10 s tick into the optional `HealthSample.monitorOps` / `monitorMs` per-tick deltas →
`health.jsonl` → the Debug → Health charts. So a monitoring storm shows up as a spike even
though every one of its spans is suppressed.

## Loader→table read-set capture

Each `loader` entry captures the tables its DB queries read (`recordReadTables`, from the
pool chokepoint, matching only `FROM`/`JOIN`) and, in `recordEntrySpan`'s `finally`, hands
them once to the **installed loader read-set sink** (`installLoaderReadSetSink`). The index
it feeds — the append-only union the change router inverts, and the per-run capture the L2
persist seam stores — is ROUTING state owned by `server-core/core/read-set.ts`, not profile
data: `server/internal/install.ts` wires the sink to server-core's `recordLoaderReadSet`,
`resetRuntimeProfile()` does not touch it, and the capture is **not** gated on the
`SINGULARITY_PROFILING=0` kill-switch (a kill-switched profiler used to stop live-state
routing). It still honours `runWithoutProfiling` suppression, which is an attribution rule —
observability writes inside a loader's context are not that loader's dependencies. No sink
installed (the web, a bare test) = nothing captured. The per-run capture is also the input
of the runtime's route drift guard (A8): a ROUTED resource's loader reading a table none of
its routes names is reported (a failed load under a test runner — pinned by
`server/internal/install.test.ts`). See
`research/2026-09-29-global-scoped-change-routing.md` (P0, P1).

## Flight-recorder substrate

Three side-structures let a slow-event consumer materialize ONE coherent instant — who was
in flight, who just finished, how saturated each gate was — from which the true call tree
can be rebuilt in a single read (see
`research/2026-07-02-global-slow-event-flight-recorder.md` and
`research/2026-07-09-global-span-instance-identity-call-tree.md`):

- **Open-entry registry** — a `Set<EntryContext>` maintained by `recordEntrySpan` (add
  before the run, delete in the `finally` — paired on every path, including throws), which
  lets a snapshot enumerate every concurrently in-flight op. Leaf `db` spans have no context
  and are not registered (the completed ring covers them). The delete runs *before*
  `record()`, so a tripping span is never in its own `open` list — the ring carries it (see
  the ordering note below).
- **Recently-completed ring** — a preallocated 4096-slot circular buffer written inside
  `record()` for spans ≥ 5 ms (the blocker often finishes before its victim's span ends,
  so open entries alone can't name it). Slots are mutable and overwritten in place;
  placement inside `record()` puts it behind the `SINGULARITY_PROFILING=0` kill-switch and
  the suppression early-returns. A completed **entry** span also parks its `waits` and
  `waitBands` in the slot, so it carries the same per-layer breakdown an open one does. The
  per-query **leaf** path (`recordSpan`) writes scalars only and stays allocation-free.
- **Gate-gauge registry** — `registerGateGauge(layer, read)` (throws on a duplicate layer)
  + `readGateGauges()`. Layer names use the SAME vocabulary as the `chargeWait` layers
  above, so a snapshot's gate occupancy joins directly to span `waits`; gate *owners*
  self-register — the recorder never names a gate.

### Per-instance identity (`id` / `parentId`)

`{kind,label}` names a span *class*, not a *run* — two concurrent `loader:tasks` runs under
different parents are indistinguishable by label, so a label-keyed window cannot be
reassembled into a tree. Every span run therefore gets an `id` from one monotonic
process-lifetime counter, and carries the enclosing entry run's `id` as `parentId` (`null`
at the top level), resolved off the live `EntryContext.parent` chain. An entry mints its id
at **open**, before `fn` runs, so a child can name it while it is still in flight; a leaf
mints at record time. `SlowSpan` and `FlightSpan` both carry the pair.

The counter is **never reset** — not by `resetRuntimeProfile()`, which deliberately leaves
live EntryContexts alone (they deregister in their own `finally`); a restarted counter would
hand an in-flight parent's id to a fresh child, splicing one call tree into another. Because
a parent always opens before its child, `parentId < id` holds for every span: the edge set is
**acyclic by construction**, and a consumer can refuse `parentId >= id` as corruption. A
`parentId` that resolves to nothing in the window is an **orphan**, not corruption — the
parent may be a sub-5 ms span the ring never took, one evicted before capture, or (for a
detached child) one that closed long ago. Consumers render such a span as a root.

### `captureFlightWindow`

`captureFlightWindow({ windowStartMs, maxOpen?, maxCompleted? })` (defaults 200/400)
synchronously materializes both span sources into a `FlightWindow` `{ atMs, open, completed }`
of `FlightSpan`s. Open spans carry `t1: null` and per-layer `waits` + `waitBands` read
mid-flight — sound, since a track's union is monotonic accumulated coverage and its band list
only ever extends (the bands are **copied**, as the live context may extend them after the
capture). Completed spans are the ring slots overlapping the window, newest first, carrying
the same `waits`/`waitBands`. Ids are unique across `open ∪ completed` (a context leaves the
registry before its span reaches the ring), so a consumer indexes both by `id` and links by
`parentId`.

The open set is **ancestor-closed**: after taking up to `maxOpen` entries from the registry,
every still-open ancestor of a taken entry is pulled in too, so `maxOpen` is a *soft* cap
(hard-bounded by `openEntries.size`) — a hole mid-chain would silently reparent a whole
subtree onto a root it never ran under. The walk stops at a closed ancestor: that edge is a
legitimate orphan, not a fillable hole. Completed spans need no such pass — a parent
finishes *after* its child, so it is newer in the ring with `t1 ≥ child.t1 ≥ windowStartMs`,
surviving both the window filter and the newest-first `maxCompleted` cut before its children.

**Ordering inside `record()`: the ring write must precede the `onSlowSpan` notify loop**
(covered by `core/recorder.test.ts`) — a handler calls `captureTrace` →
`captureFlightWindow` *synchronously*, and by then the tripping entry is already out of
`openEntries`, so a ring write after the notify would leave the trip span in neither source.
Both early-returns still guard the write, so kill-switch and suppression semantics are
unchanged. `resetRuntimeProfile()` clears the ring (profile data) but keeps gauges
(structural registrations), leaves open entries to their own `finally`, and does not touch
the id counter.

Overhead: one `++` per span, one paired `Set.add`/`Set.delete` per *entry* span (entry spans
are low-rate — never per-DB-query), a comparison + ~12 field writes per qualifying completed
span (label strings and the `waits`/`waitBands` references are shared, not copied), and per
`chargeWait` one comparison plus at most one push into a `WAIT_BAND_CAP`-bounded array. The
remaining allocations are one flat band array per completed entry span, and whatever
`captureFlightWindow` builds on a (rate-limited) slow-event trip.

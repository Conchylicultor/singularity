// Zero-dependency, isomorphic runtime profiling recorder.
//
// This module imports NOTHING from other plugins (and no Node APIs) so it can
// sit at the very bottom of the dependency DAG. It is imported by
// `endpoints/core`, `database/server`, and `server-core/core` — all
// load-bearing — and must never form a back-edge that would create a cycle.
//
// The store is in-memory and bounded: per-(kind,label) rolling aggregates plus
// a small "slowest recent" ring per kind. Tiny and lost on restart, which is
// fine for live iterate-and-measure profiling.
//
// ## Ambient caller attribution
//
// Each `db`/`loader` span also records the single innermost enclosing request
// or loader it ran under (its immediate "parent"), so repeated-query (N+1)
// problems point straight at their source. The ambient context is supplied by
// an injected `SpanContextRuntime`: this module stays pure (no `node:async_hooks`,
// so the web bundle is unaffected); the server installs an AsyncLocalStorage-backed
// runtime at boot via `installSpanContextRuntime`. On the web the default no-op
// runtime makes every entry point a transparent passthrough.
//
// ## Wall-clock decomposition (wait / child / self)
//
// Every entry span decomposes its wall-clock into `waitMs` (time spent queued
// on named gates/pools, at any depth of its subtree), `childMs` (time covered
// by direct-child entry spans), and `selfMs` (the remainder: its own
// orchestration/CPU). Gate waits propagate to EVERY open ancestor — not just
// the innermost entry — so a composite span (e.g. a `flush` draining many
// loaders) names the gates its subtree waited on instead of showing a huge
// wall-clock with empty `waits`.
//
// The load-bearing constraint is concurrency: a flush drains many loaders in
// parallel, so SUMMING child waits into an ancestor can exceed the ancestor's
// wall-clock (20 loaders × 60s gate wait inside a 90s flush would read as
// "1200s of wait"). Each ancestor therefore accumulates waits as an
// interval-UNION over its own timeline (`Track`), guaranteeing
// `waitMs ≤ wall` and `selfMs ≥ 0` at every level. Because every charge
// arrives at its interval's END time (gates call `onWait` at slot acquisition;
// children charge at finish), the charge stream is end-ordered by
// construction, so a streaming union — O(1) state per track, no interval list
// — is exact for these streams; an interval that reaches back before the
// track's covered frontier contributes only the part past it (conservative:
// never overcounts, so `selfMs` can never go negative).
//
// A finished child charges its execution interval into the NEAREST open
// ancestor only: each parent's own interval propagates upward when *it*
// finishes, so charging every ancestor would double-count grandchildren.
// Gate waits, by contrast, go to ALL open ancestors — a union is idempotent
// under re-covering the same time range, so the same wait interval landing in
// every level is exactly what makes each level's `waits` self-contained.

// `http` / `db` / `loader` are spans of real work. `sub` / `push` are *origin*
// entries: the WS-subscription ack and the cascade/push flush that trigger a
// loader. They exist so a loader run is never `parent: null` — the loader span's
// parent names the request class that triggered it (sub = a tab subscribed,
// push = a notify cascade), making head-of-line blocking attributable to its
// origin. `flush` is the live-state notify-flush cycle: each `flushNotifies`
// drain runs inside a `flush` entry, so the per-resource `push` loads it triggers
// nest under it — `aggregates.flush[*].byParent` is the head-of-line attribution
// (which resource dominated a flush cycle) for free. See
// research/2026-06-19-global-wait-attribution-instrumentation.md and
// research/2026-06-19-global-observability-frequency-delivery-and-dead-job-gc.md.
// `job` is a top-level background-work entry recorded around each
// graphile-worker `job.run()`, analogous to `http` but triggered by the queue
// rather than an incoming request; its label is the job name.
// `cascade` is an origin entry (sibling to `sub`/`push`) recorded around a
// dependsOn edge's `signature`/`affectedMap` DB reads — the ids-translation work
// a scoped cascade runs to compute which downstream rows a change touched. It
// exists so those reads (a) route through the loader DB gate like a loader and
// (b) are attributed as their own kind in the profiler, instead of running
// unmeasured and ungated under the enclosing `flush` entry. Its label is the
// downstream resource key the edge feeds. Deliberately NOT a `loader` kind: edge
// reads are a cascade mechanism, not the downstream's value dependencies, so they
// must NOT enter the loader read-set index (that would create false silent-FULL
// flags). See research/2026-07-07-global-read-set-notifications-attribution-noise.md.
//
// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: `SPAN_KINDS` is the one enumeration of every span kind.
// `SpanKind`, this module's iteration set, the MCP tool's filter, and the
// endpoint response's zod enum are all DERIVED from it — so adding a kind here

 * facts are identical; what differs is `elapsedMs` and what it means that the
 * run is still going. A second schema would have to be kept identical by hand.
 *
 * `deadlineMs` is CARRIED, not looked up at render time. A report records what
 * was claimed when it was filed, and the class table is editable — re-deriving
 * the number later would let an edit silently rewrite the past. This is also
 * what lets the renderers obey the rule that no renderer restates a number from
 * the class table: every duration they print arrived here from `deadlineMsFor`.

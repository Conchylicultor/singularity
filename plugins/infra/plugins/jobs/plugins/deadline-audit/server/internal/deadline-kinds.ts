// Re-alert the bell at most once per 10 minutes per job. An overrunning job is

// `duressExempt: true` on BOTH kinds. A job wedging its slot and a host duress
// episode are the SAME event far more often than not — the box is in trouble,
// the sentinel latches duress, and the reports funnel starts shedding. Without
// this flag `recordReport` buffers exactly the reports that describe the outage
// and hands back `{ reportId: null }`, so the alarm for the outage is silenced
// by the outage. That is Silencer 2 of the 2026-08-17 incident, and the same
// argument `wedged-kind.ts`, `duress-shed` and `duress-episode` all make: this
// report IS the durable record of the condition, so shedding it loses the only
// evidence there was one.

 * Deduped per `jobName`, because that is the unit anyone acts on: one handler
 * overrunning across many dispatches is one problem, not N.
 *
 * Variant `warning`, not `error`: the abort itself is the system working. The

 * from there. What escalates to `error` is the handler ignoring the abort, and
 * that has its own kind below.

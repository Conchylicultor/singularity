// event into this payload — the parent writes the object straight to disk on
// its way out of the process, and the flush hands it back as opaque jsonb. So
// there is no call site where a drifting field would be a type error, and this
// assignment is that call site. If `JobSlotFloorReport` gains, loses or renames
// a field, this line stops compiling instead of the next floor crash filing a
// report whose payload its own schema rejects — on a backend that has already
// exited, where the failure is one line in a boot log.

/**
 * The `job-slot-floor` report kind: **a runner has lost slots it cannot get
 * back, and one of them mattered enough to act on.**
 *
 * One rolling report per worktree (fixed fingerprint — the reports unique index
 * is `(fingerprint, worktree)`, so worktrees never collide). Deliberately NOT
 * per runner: the thing being reported is the state of this worktree's worker
 * pool, and the upsert refreshes `data` on the newest occurrence, so the row
 * always shows the latest and worst thing that happened to it.
 *
 * `duressExempt: true`, for the third time in this plugin and for the same
 * reason: a pool losing its slots and a host duress episode are usually the
 * same event, and shedding this report would lose the only evidence of a
 * backend that exited on purpose.
 *
 * The `kind` string comes from the parent (`JOB_SLOT_FLOOR_KIND`) rather than
 * being typed here. The parent is what writes the durable line, synchronously,
 * during a deliberate exit; a second spelling that drifted would leave that
 * line unresolvable on the next boot.

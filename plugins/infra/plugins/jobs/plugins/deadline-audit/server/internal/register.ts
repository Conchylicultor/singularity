 * fallback branch (`reportServerError`) — so a deadline firing before this
 * plugin is ready is still loud, it just lands as a plain server error instead

    // the seam's contract "did it record?" unanswerable at the moment we have
    // to answer it. So `true` here means *this event has a durable home and is
    // on its way there*, which is exactly the question the parent's fallback
    // branch needs answered: it distinguishes "nobody is listening" from "a
    // consumer owns this". A failure inside `recordReport` surfaces as an
    // unhandled rejection, which the reports plugin itself files.
    // A zombie that finally settled. There is no kind for it, deliberately:
    // the durable record it would update is a `job-zombie` row, and bumping
    // that row's count to say "it recovered" would make the count mean two
    // opposite things. Declining it (`false`) rather than claiming it is the
    // honest answer to the seam's question — the parent then logs the recovery
    // and files nothing, which is the branch it has for exactly this.

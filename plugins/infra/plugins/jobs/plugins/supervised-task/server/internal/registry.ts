 * type on a command line, which is exactly why it was the last durable job still
 * dying with its backend.
 *
 * A task closes that gap without inventing a second runtime. `./singularity
 * supervised-exec <id> <payloadJson>` boots the plugin graph in `exec` mode —
 * load waves, `register`, `collectContributions`, `onReadyBlocking`, and nothing
 * else — resolves the id here, and calls `run`. So the body sees the same
 * contributions, the same config registry and the same database the backend
 * does, and none of the machinery a short-lived process must not start (see
 * `server-core`'s "Boot modes").
 *
 * ```ts
 * export const backupTask = defineSupervisedTask({
 *   id: "backup.run",
 *   payload: z.object({ runId: z.string(), trigger: z.enum(["manual", "periodic"]) }),
 *   run: async ({ runId, trigger }) => { … },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Mounted with `register: [backupTask]`, spawned by handing
 * `backupTask.invoke(payload)` to `defineSupervisedJob`'s `task` arm.
 *
 * A `register:` token rather than a side effect at module eval, and for the
 * reason the CLI depends on: the framework runs every plugin's register phase to
 * completion before anything else, so by the time `supervised-exec` looks up an
 * id the registry is complete — a miss is genuinely a miss, never a module that
 * had not been reached yet.

/**
 * Whether a supervised run's processes are still alive — **judged by its process

 *
 * `pid` is what a ledger row stores: the pid of the shim `startSupervisedRun`
 * spawned `detached`, which makes the shim the leader of a fresh process group
 * whose id is that same number. The real work (`bun … supervised-exec …`,
 * `./singularity build`) lives inside that group. Kill already treats the pid
 * as a group (`killSupervisedRun` signals `-pid`); liveness has to agree with
 * it, or a lone `kill -9 <shim>` reads as "no marker, pid dead" and closes the
 * row as a hard kill while the worker — re-parented to init, still in the group
 * — keeps running. That close released the kind's in-flight lock under a live
 * child (the retry ladder then ran attempt 2 CONCURRENTLY with attempt 1) and
 * stopped the transcript tail one worker short of the end.
 *
 * So the run is alive while EITHER probe succeeds:
 *
 * - `kill(-pid, 0)` — any process of the group remains. An orphaned worker keeps
 *   its pgid after re-parenting, so the run stays open until the work really
 *   ends.
 * - `kill(pid, 0)` — still needed, because a freshly-claimed row is seeded with
 *   `process.pid` (the backend's own) before its child exists, and a backend is
 *   not guaranteed to lead a group: the group probe alone could answer ESRCH for
 *   a live seed.
 *
 * Neither probe sends a signal. ESRCH means gone; EPERM means the process (or a
 * member of the group) exists but belongs to another user — still alive. On
 * macOS a group member still tearing down after a SIGKILL also answers EPERM,
 * for a few milliseconds; reading that as alive only defers the close to the
 * next reconcile or wake, which decides again from scratch. The
 * recycled-pid blind spot does not widen: while a group is non-empty its id
 * cannot be handed out as a new pid.
 *
 * THE one copy. The single-pid form was hand-rolled in `run-build.ts` and again
 * in `run-release.ts`, and the two agreed only by luck — the EPERM arm is the
 * easy one to forget, and forgetting it reads a live foreign-owned child as dead.
 * There is deliberately no exported single-pid probe any more: every
 * supervised-run liveness decision goes through this one.

 * writes it once, atomically (tmp + rename), after `wait` on the child returns
 * and before the shim itself exits. It is never written mid-run and never

 * - the run is still going (no marker yet, group alive), or
 * - the run was **hard**-killed: SIGKILL runs no shell, so nothing ever wrote
 *   the marker and nothing ever will (no marker, group empty) ⇒ the `-1` sentinel,

 * ENOENT is therefore an ordinary answer, not an error. A marker that EXISTS
 * but does not parse is the opposite — it throws {@link RunMarkerError}. The
 * file is published by rename and never rewritten, so a reader cannot catch a
 * partial write; malformed bytes mean the shim wrote something it should never
 * have written, and answering `null` would file that under "hard-killed" and
 * hide a real defect behind a plausible-looking `-1`. Any other read error is a
 * genuine fault and rethrows.

 * used to state it separately and had to be kept in agreement by hand.
 *
 * The `supervisedRun.ended` event is only a wake-up: it can be lost (the backend
 * dying between the shim writing the marker and the emit landing), it can arrive
 * for a run whose ledger row was stamped minutes earlier by the caller's own
 * CLI, and it carries no outcome to trust even if it does arrive. The marker
 * file is the authority — written once, atomically, by the shim wrapping the

 * re-reads it and decides from scratch.
 *
 * The three arms, and why each is what it is:
 *
 * - **Marker present ⇒ ended, even while the group is still alive.** The shim
 *   writes the marker BEFORE it exits, so the file is a terminal signal in its
 *   own right; waiting for the processes would only add latency.
 * - **No marker, group alive ⇒ running.** The only shape a genuinely-running run
 *   has, and the only one that keeps waiting. Includes a run whose shim alone was
 *   SIGKILLed while its worker lives on — see {@link isRunAlive}.
 * - **No marker, group empty ⇒ hard kill.** SIGKILL runs no handler, so nothing
 *   was ever there to write a marker and nothing ever will be. {@link
 *   HARD_KILL_EXIT_CODE} (`-1`) is a status no child can produce, which keeps
 *   the case legible, and `signalCode` stays `null` because nobody OBSERVED a
 *   signal — **never re-derive killed-ness from `exitCode > 128`**, here or in
 *   a consumer: `kill -TERM` and a program calling `exit(143)` are the same
 *   number, and guessing between them is what recorded a deploy that never
 *   exited as "Exited with code 143". The same `-1` closes a run whose shim was
 *   killed alone, once its worker has also gone: only the shim could `wait` for
 *   the worker's status, so nobody witnessed how it ended.
 *
 * `now` is the instant stamped on that last arm only; a marker always carries
 * its own mtime.

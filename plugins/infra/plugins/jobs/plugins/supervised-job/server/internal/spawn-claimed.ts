/**
 * Spawn the child for an already-claimed run, and close the row **only if no
 * child was ever started**.
 *
 * Between `claim` and a live child there is a window where the ledger row exists
 * and nothing will ever finish it. If the start fails before `Bun.spawn` — no
 * `./singularity` on PATH, a duplicate run id, `EAGAIN` — the row is left
 * holding `process.pid`, which is THIS backend's own and very much alive. The
 * reconciler's close rule reads it as *running* on every pass, forever, because
 * no child exists to write a marker and no pid will die until the backend does.
 * **That row is the kind's lock** (the partial unique in-flight index), so the
 * kind then refuses every future run — build, release and deploy alike — with no
 * symptom at the call site. Closing it is the repair, and it lives here once
 * rather than in each consumer's catch (release carried exactly this code as
 * `failUnstartedRelease`).
 *
 * **After the spawn, the same close would be a bug, and a worse one.** A failure
 * in the bookkeeping that follows `Bun.spawn` — the `setPid` write, the watcher
 * — leaves a child that is genuinely running: it will write its transcript and
 * its exit marker, and the reconciler settles it through the ordinary path.
 * Stamping `finished_at` there RELEASES the in-flight lock while that child runs,
 * so the next enqueue claims cleanly and spawns a second one — two concurrent
 * builds against one checkout, two converges against one remote server. Doing
 * nothing on that side is not a gap; it is the correct action.
 *
 * Which side it failed on is therefore never inferred here. `startSupervisedRun`
 * reports it as `SupervisedSpawnError.childStarted`, derived from whether the pid
 * was actually assigned, and the guard below **compensates only on positive proof
 * that no child exists** — an unrecognised error is treated as "a child may be
 * running", because a wedged kind is recoverable by a restart and a duplicated
 * build is not.
 *
 * The sentinel is `HARD_KILL_EXIT_CODE`, the same value the reconciler would
 * stamp on this row after a restart, and honest for the same reason: no marker
 * was ever written, and none ever will be.
 *
 * The original error is always what propagates — the job must still fail loudly
 * and earn its report. If the close ALSO fails, both errors travel together in
 * an `AggregateError`, because at that point the kind really is wedged until a
 * restart and the message is the only warning anyone gets.

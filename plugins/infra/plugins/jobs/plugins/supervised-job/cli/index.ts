/**
 * The child half of a supervised task: boot the plugin graph in `exec` mode,
 * run ONE registered task, exit with its status.
 *
 * Not a verb anyone types. It exists because the supervisor
 * (`server/internal/run/`) supervises an ARGV, and a `run` body has no argv of
 * its own — so this is the argv that stands for one. The job's registered task
 * (`server/internal/run-body.ts`) builds the invocation; nothing else should write this command line by hand,
 * which is why the payload is positional JSON rather than a set of flags: there
 * is no ergonomics to serve, only a round-trip to keep exact.
 *
 * `detachable`, and it is not optional. A supervised child is spawned detached
 * and is MEANT to outlive the backend that started it — that is the whole point
 * of the primitive. The orphan guard is armed for every invocation and exits a
 * command whose invoking shell went away, which for this command would kill the
 * very run the design exists to preserve.
 *
 * This file loads on EVERY `./singularity` invocation (commander needs names and
 * flags before it parses argv), so it imports the verb's own name and
 * `defineCliCommand` and nothing else; `runExec` and the task registry sit
 * behind the deferred `run: () => import(…)`. `cli:command-declarations-light`
 * measures that closure.

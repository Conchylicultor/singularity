/**
 * `./singularity supervised-exec <taskId> <payloadJson> --namespace <ns>`.
 *
 * The whole body sits inside `runExec`, which boots the plugin graph and never
 * returns: it exits 0 when the body resolves and 1 when anything in it throws,
 * running the shutdown hooks either way. The exit status is what the
 * supervising shim records into this run's marker, so a throw here IS how a
 * failed task reaches the ledger.
 *
 * **The lookup happens after boot, and it must.** The registry is populated by
 * each declaring plugin's `register:` token, which the boot's register phase
 * runs — so before boot every id is unknown and after it the set is complete.
 * There is no earlier point at which "unknown task" could be answered honestly.

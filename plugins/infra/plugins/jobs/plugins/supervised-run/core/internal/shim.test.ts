 * it, that an argument containing a space or a quote survives, that a trapped
 * signal lets `wait` return `128+signo` instead of killing the shell outright,
 * that a SIGKILL leaves nothing behind — is a fact about a POSIX shell's

 * spawn one. So these tests spawn detached children and signal their process

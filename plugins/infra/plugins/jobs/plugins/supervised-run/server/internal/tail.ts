/**
 * How many bytes of ONE run's transcript reach the log channel.
 *
 * The bound is on what is PUBLISHED, not on what the child writes, and the
 * distinction is the honest one: the transcript file is a plain kernel fd the
 * child owns, so nothing this process does can cap it mid-run without racing
 * the writer. What this ceiling protects is the thing a runaway run would
 * otherwise take down with it — the channel's in-memory ring and its durable
 * `.jsonl` sink, which every OTHER channel shares a rotation budget with.
 *
 * 16 MiB is far above any real build, release or deploy transcript (a full
 * `./singularity build` is low single-digit MB) and far below the point where
 * publishing it costs anything. The transcript FILE's own bound is the artifact
 * prune: the newest 50 runs per kind per worktree, reaped when the next run
 * starts. A single pathological run's file is bounded only by that run.

/**
 * Publish a supervised run's output by tailing its transcript file.
 *
 * **This is the whole design, not an implementation detail.** The child's
 * stdout and stderr go to a file descriptor rather than a pipe, and this is the
 * only thing that turns those bytes into log-channel lines. A pipe belongs to
 * the process that created it, so a pipe-shaped live path needs a second,
 * artifact-shaped recovery path beside it — and the recovery path is the one
 * that rots, because nothing exercises it until something has already gone
 * wrong. That is precisely what happened to release, whose recovery artifact
 * only the parent ever wrote, so a genuinely orphaned release had nothing to
 * read and got stamped `-1`.
 *
 * With one path there is nothing to fall back to, so nothing can be
 * under-maintained: a backend restart stops being a special case and becomes
 * "the same tailer, started again". Both current callers start at offset 0 —
 * the spawn-time caller because the file is new, and the boot re-attach caller
 * because the channel's ring buffer is process memory and is empty again, so
 * republishing from the top is what puts the output back on the user's screen.
 * `fromOffset` stays in the contract because it is a genuine property of a
 * tail, not because either caller needs a different value today.
 *
 * Change detection is NOT this module's business — it holds no timer and
 * subscribes to nothing. The supervisor owns one `@parcel/watcher`
 * subscription over the run-artifact directory and calls `pump()`; the repo
 * bans polling, and one watcher for every live run of every kind is the shape
 * that keeps it banned. The cost is the watcher's ~100 ms debounce, which is
 * imperceptible against a build log.

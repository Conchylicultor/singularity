 * - **no piped stdio anywhere**, which is why this file is a sanctioned

/**
 * Cancel a supervised run by signalling it.
 *
 * Cancellation of an out-of-process run is "signal a pid", not "abort a
 * promise", and this exists so each consumer does not reinvent that — including
 * the part that is easy to get wrong.
 *
 * **The signal goes to the process GROUP** (`-pid`), not to the shim alone. The
 * shim does not forward signals to its child, so signalling it by itself would
 * kill the supervisor and leave the real work running, reparented and
 * untracked. Signalling the group reaches both: the child dies, and the shim's
 * `wait` returns `128+signo` and records it — so a cancelled run gets a true 143
 * on its row rather than the `-1` a lost supervisor would have produced. The
 * group exists because the spawn is `detached`.
 *
 * The pid comes from the kind's ledger, never from an in-memory map, so this
 * works on a run started by a previous backend.

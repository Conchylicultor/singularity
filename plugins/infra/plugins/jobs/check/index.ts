// The one file allowed to insert a `jobs.run` row is `server/internal/registry.ts`;
// everything else goes through `job.enqueue(...)`, which routes there. The one
// file that may SPELL a graphile task identifier is the class table
// (`core/hold.ts`). Both are exempted in the jobs plugin's own manifest.

// Why this exists rather than a comment saying "remember to pass the queue name".
//
// A job declaring `serial` (see registry.ts `SerialSpec`) is serialized by
// graphile's `queue_name`, and graphile refuses to FETCH a job whose queue is
// busy — that is what makes waiting free, and what stops one wedged job from
// costing more than one worker slot. But the guarantee is carried by the row: an
// insertion that omits the queue name produces a row with `job_queue_id IS NULL`,
// which graphile fetches regardless of who else is running. One forgetful call
// site silently un-serializes that path, with no type error, no runtime error,
// and no symptom until two of them run at once.
//
// So the queue name is derived from the registered job inside `registry.ts`
// (`queueNameFor` / `graphileSpecFor`) and is never a caller argument — and this
// check keeps that true by making the alternative unspellable: `utils.addJob(`
// and `graphile_worker.add_job` exist in exactly one file. There were five
// insertion sites when `serial` landed (two in `registry.ts`, `resume-job.ts`'s
// target re-enqueue, and `worker.ts`'s `scheduleResume` + cron items); the point
// of the check is that a sixth cannot be added without noticing.
//
// ── The same argument, one field later: the task identifier ────────────────
//
// A row's graphile task identifier is now the other half of that same "property
// of the registered job, never a caller argument" rule. Since hold classes
// landed there is one task per class (`jobs.run.instant` / `.seconds` /
// `.minutes`), derived by `taskFor(job.hold)`, and each is served by a different
// subset of the three runners — that partition at FETCH is the whole reservation
// mechanism. `"jobs.run"` is the pre-class legacy identifier, kept registered on
// the widest runner forever so no row can strand on a task nobody serves.
//
// So a hand-typed `"jobs.run"` anywhere else is a row that silently lands in the
// widest tier and escapes its class's reservation — no type error, no runtime
// error, and no symptom beyond latency nobody attributes to it. The literal is
// therefore confined to `core/hold.ts`, which declares it as `LEGACY_JOB_TASK`;
// everything else imports that name and gets a tsc error when it is wrong.

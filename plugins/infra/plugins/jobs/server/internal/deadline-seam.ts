/**
 * The seam every deadline event is announced on: one run overran its hold
 * class, and — 30 seconds later — one run still had not settled after being
 * given up on.
 *
 * WHY A SEAM AND NOT A DIRECT `@plugins/reports` IMPORT. Two reasons, and the
 * second is a hard constraint.
 *
 * It is the wrong layering. `jobs` is load-bearing infrastructure and must not
 * name the observability stack; `reports` owns interpretation — kinds,
 * fingerprints, duress shedding, the bell, task filing. This is the same rule
 * `removal-seam.ts` states for `infra/worktree`, and the same one
 * `queue-health/CLAUDE.md` gives as the reason for its own placement. It also
 * has a concrete cost: naming `reports` here would force every composition
 * containing `jobs` to also contain `reports`, `shell/notifications` and
 * `tasks`.
 *
 * And it would be a cycle. `reports` already reaches `jobs` by two independent
 * routes today — `reports/server/internal/record-report.ts:15` →
 * `shell/notifications/server` → `ttl-cleanup.ts:4` → `jobs`, and
 * `reports/server/internal/retention.ts:2` → `infra/retention/server` → `jobs`.
 * Both are there because `reports` is a *user* of durable background work, which
 * is exactly the relationship a primitive cannot invert. Severing the two routes
 * would leave a standing rule that "reports must never use a background job" —
 * a far worse constraint than a sink.
 *
 * `jobs` has already faced this identical shape once: it needs `registerTrigger`
 * from `events` for `ctx.waitFor`, and `events` already imports `jobs`. The
 * answer was `UNSAFE_installDurableHooks` (`step-ctx.ts`). This is that answer
 * again, using the factored-out primitive rather than a hand-rolled setter.
 *
 * The consumer is the `deadline-audit` sub-plugin, which registers a handler in
 * its `onReady`. A child importing its parent is not a cycle: the parent never
 * imports the child.
 *
 * `emit()` never throws (the report-sink contract), which matters because these
 * calls happen on the abort path — the one path that must not acquire a second
 * failure mode. `emit()` returning `undefined` means nobody registered, and
 * every caller treats that as a branch (fall back to `reportServerError`), never
 * as an assumption.

// Single source of truth for the `ctx.waitFor` / `ctx.sleep` durable-hook
// binding contract. Both sides of the events↔jobs IoC seam reference this one
// module:
//   - PRODUCER: the worker's durable ctx (step-ctx.ts) constructs the trigger
//     row's `with` payload (and the timeout/sleep scheduled enqueue payload),
//     typed by {@link ResumeInput}.
//   - CONSUMER: the private `jobs.resume` builtin (resume-job.ts) parses that
//     payload with {@link ResumeInputSchema}.
// Pinning the producer's type to the same schema the consumer parses makes the
// construction compile-checked, so the two can never drift (the mismatch was
// previously only caught at runtime when the dispatcher parsed `with`).
//
// This file deliberately depends on neither step-ctx nor resume-job, so it can
// be imported by both without forming a cycle.

// Reserved keys inserted into the `jobs.resume` payload via a trigger's
// `with` clause (or a scheduled enqueue for timeouts). Kept together so the
// resume handler can discriminate them from the event payload's own keys
// (which arrive via the events dispatcher's merge).

// enqueues (scheduleResume in the worker) also go through this same shape.

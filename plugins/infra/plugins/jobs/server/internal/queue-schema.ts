// ── Who installs the queue schema, and who merely asserts it ─────────────────
//
// The queue schema is a property of the DATABASE, not of whoever happens to
// enqueue first.
//
// Installation used to be a SIDE EFFECT of the first `makeWorkerUtils()` call
// (`worker.ts`'s `getWorkerUtils`), which meant the invariant held from
// "whenever the first non-transactional enqueue landed" rather than from boot —
// and never at all for a process that only ever enqueues inside somebody else's
// transaction, which writes on the caller's own connection and reaches no
// graphile helper. This file is that installation, made explicit and callable:
// the jobs plugin runs it at `onReadyBlocking`, and a test that provisions a
// throwaway database calls it directly.
//
// WHICH DATABASES ACTUALLY NEED IT. A worktree database does not: the fork
// keeps graphile's migration watermark (`ExcludeSchemaDataFromFork({ schema:
// "graphile_worker", keep: ["migrations"] })` in `../index.ts`) while emptying
// the rows that describe main's queue, so a fork is born with a schema graphile
// already considers installed and the call below is one connect and one
// `SELECT`. What still needs it is a database that never had the schema at all
// — main's very first boot, a `createTestDb` throwaway — and a graphile version
// bump whose new migrations must be applied.
//
// Installation is owned by whoever provisions or boots the database. `enqueue`
// only ASSERTS — see `registry.ts`'s tx transport. The tempting unification
// ("just install at the top of `enqueue`") is rejected in the design doc
// (`research/2026-08-20-jobs-queue-schema-is-a-property-of-the-database.md`):
// the connection string names THIS process's app database while `opts.tx` may
// be a transaction on any database, so it would install the schema in one place
// and write in another, and on a fresh database it would run graphile's whole
// migration chain inside the caller's open transaction, holding their row locks
// `idle in transaction` for the duration. A rung-4 assert dressed as a rung-1
// fix.

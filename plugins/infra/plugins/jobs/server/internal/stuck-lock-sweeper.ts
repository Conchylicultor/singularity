// Recovery floor for jobs that were mid-execution when their worker died
// uncleanly (SIGKILL, OOM-killer, kernel panic, `process.exit()` from a
// buggy handler — anything that bypasses our SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown path).
//
// Clean restarts are already handled: `runner.stop()` waits for in-flight
// handlers to finish, so locks clear naturally. This sweeper is the
// safety net for the rest.
//
// Why we need it at all: graphile-worker 0.16.6 hardcodes the lock-recovery
// threshold to 4 hours in SQL (`resetLockedAt.js:12`, `sql/000005.sql:124`) and
// exposes no runtime override, so a crashed worker's jobs sit unrunnable for up
// to 4h. We run our own reclaim instead; it races harmlessly with graphile's.
//
// WHAT CHANGED, and why it is not a tuning knob any more: this used to reclaim a
// row because its `locked_at` was OLD (5 minutes). An age cannot distinguish a
// dead worker from a busy one, so every handler that ran longer than the
// threshold — a large upload, a `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`, a `./singularity push`,
// a long git checkout — had its still-live work reclaimed and re-dispatched
// CONCURRENTLY with itself. It now reclaims a row because a worker is provably
// NOT running it: no session holds its advisory lock (`jobLockHeldExpr`), a fact
// Postgres maintains and releases as part of backend teardown. See
// `job-lock.ts` and `research/2026-07-30-jobs-exact-liveness-advisory-locks.md`.
//
// A reclaim RELEASES the row so graphile runs it again — except for a
// SUPERSEDED row (`supersededExpr`): one graphile retired mid-run because a
// newer copy of the same job key was queued. That copy owns the work, so a
// superseded row whose run is over (unlocked, or locked with no live lock) is
// DELETED instead of released. Released, it would read as a dead job. See
// jobs/CLAUDE.md, "Superseded rows", and `superseded-trigger.ts`.
//
// Why this stays a raw setInterval and NOT a scheduled `defineJob`: it is the
// recovery mechanism FOR the job system. Routing it through graphile's own
// queue would mean a wedged worker (the exact failure this clears) couldn't
// run its own recovery — a deadlock. Infra that recovers the job system must
// not depend on the job system.

// The ONE residual timestamp in this design, and it does NOT bound handler
// runtime — it bounds ACQUISITION LATENCY, which is a constant of the dispatch
// path. Graphile stamps `locked_at` inside `get_job`; `withJobLock` takes the
// advisory lock a few milliseconds later in `dispatch()`. A row observed inside
// that window has `locked_at` set and no lock yet, and would otherwise look
// abandoned. So we only consider rows whose lock has had this long to appear.
//
// Read that difference carefully before touching this constant: a six-hour
// handler is exactly as safe as a 200 ms one, because nothing here grows with
// handler duration and nothing a job author writes can violate it. If a job
// ever looks "stuck", the answer is never to raise this number.

// TWO locks are swept here, in the same tick and on the same evidence: the job
// row's, and — since `defineJob({ serial })` landed — the row's named QUEUE.
//
// This file used to say the opposite, and it is worth recording why, because the
// reasoning was correct at the time and stopped being correct for a reason that
// is easy to miss. It said queue locks are deliberately not swept, because
// "nothing ever sets `queue_name`" (true until `serial` existed) and because
// "if a named queue is ever adopted, clearing its lock would defeat the
// serialization that is the entire reason to have one" (true of the AGE-based
// sweeper this file used to be — an age cannot tell a busy queue from an
// abandoned one, so an age-gated queue sweep really would let a second job into
// a queue whose first job was still running). Neither half survives a
// LIVENESS-gated sweep: `serial` sets `queue_name`, and a queue whose jobs hold
// no advisory lock has no live occupant to protect.
//
// Not sweeping it is what would be dangerous now. graphile releases a queue lock
// in its own fail/success handlers, which a SIGKILLed worker never reaches; the
// row is then locked by a process that no longer exists, `is_available` is
// false, and `get_job` (dist/sql/getJob.js:72-74) refuses to fetch ANY job in
// that queue. graphile's own recovery hardcodes a 4-hour threshold
// (`resetLockedAt.js:12`), so the first crash after adopting named queues would
// wedge every job in the lane for four hours — a new outage, strictly worse than
// the one `serial` was introduced to fix.

  // newer copy, so once its own run is over there is nothing left to do with it:
  // it is deleted, never released. Releasing it is what used to happen, and it
  // turned the row into a false dead job (retired rows already carry `attempts =

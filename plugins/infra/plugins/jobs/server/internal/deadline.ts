// THE INVARIANT OF THIS FILE: **there is no `Promise.race` here, and there must
// never be one.**
//
// Racing the handler against a deadline would let the wrapper RETURN while the
// handler is still running. That return releases the advisory lock, which is the
// only thing telling the stuck-lock sweeper this row still has an owner; the
// sweeper then reclaims the row, graphile re-dispatches it, and a possibly
// non-idempotent handler runs a second time alongside its own zombie. That is
// precisely the corruption the advisory-lock design exists to prevent — the same
// shape as the old age-based lease, which stole ~25 live jobs in 8 days.
//
// So the timers here abort a signal, announce, and write the slot off. Nothing
// returns early, no row is touched, no lock is released. The slot frees when,
// and only when, the handler actually settles.
//
// The write-off (forfeit.ts) is accounting, never recovery — and the one thing
// it can lead to is this PROCESS exiting, which is a different act entirely
// from taking a job away from a handler: at teardown Postgres drops every
// advisory lock at once, so the next boot's sweeper reclaims rows whose owner
// provably no longer exists. That is the only safe way slots come back.
//
// The abort is also the ONLY lever available. We cannot un-await a promise, so a
// handler that ignores `ctx.signal` keeps running — which is why the second timer
// exists: the point at which we say so out loud rather than assuming the first
// one worked.

// Globally-shared brand. `Symbol.for` returns the same Symbol across module
// reloads (HMR), worker pools, and separate copies of @plugins/jobs reachable
// through different paths — so `isJobDeadlineExceededError()` is robust where
// `instanceof` would silently fail when the class identity differs between throw
// and catch. Same rationale as `NonRetryableError`'s brand in non-retryable.ts.

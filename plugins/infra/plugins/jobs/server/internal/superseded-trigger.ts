// ── Marking a row superseded at the one moment it can be told apart ───────────
//
// graphile retires a keyed row that is not `is_available` whenever the same key
// is queued again (`add_jobs`, sql/000018.sql:103-116) or removed (`remove_job`):
// `key = null, attempts = max_attempts, updated_at = now()`. When the row was
// LOCKED at that moment, a newer copy of the job now exists and will run — the old
// row is superseded, not dead. But the retire UPDATE writes exactly the columns a
// genuinely dead row has, and touches neither `revision` nor `flags`, so once the
// row is unlocked (a restart's sweep, a graceful-shutdown timeout, a failing
// overrun) nothing about it says which of the two it was.
//
// "Key is null on a keyed job" is NOT that evidence. graphile retires EVERY
// unavailable row with the key, a dead-lettered one included, so the next cron
// tick of a job that really died would clear its key too and hide it from the
// dead list. The one fact that separates the two is whether the row was locked
// WHEN it was retired, and that is only observable inside the retire UPDATE —
// hence a row trigger, and hence this file.
//
// The `WHEN` clause keeps it off every hot path: Postgres evaluates it before
// calling the function, and `UPDATE OF key` means it is not even considered for
// an UPDATE that does not name `key` — fetch, complete, fail, reschedule and our
// own sweeper never do. Only graphile's two retire-while-locked writes match.
//
// The function lives in `graphile_worker` beside the table it guards, so a
// worktree fork (which copies that schema's DDL and drops only its data — see
// `ExcludeSchemaDataFromFork` in `../index.ts`) is born with it installed.

 *
 * Why the no-op path matters: every backend calls this at boot, including the
 * one coming up while the outgoing backend's workers are still fetching. The
 * catalog read above takes no table lock, so a boot that finds the trigger
 * already in place touches nothing. Only a first install (or a changed
 * definition) runs the DDL, which briefly takes SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE on the
 * table — blocking writers for the length of one statement.
 *
 * The slow path is serialized with a transaction-scoped advisory lock and
 * re-checks under it, so two installers racing on one database (a backend
 * booting while a `worktree-db` test process installs against the same
 * database) do not both run the DDL. The two-int lock form lives in a different
 * `pg_locks` key space (`objsubid = 2`) from the per-job locks (`objsubid = 1`,
 * `jobLockHeldExpr`), so it can never be mistaken for a live worker.

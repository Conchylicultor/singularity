/**
 * Real-DB regression suite for the one claim this file exists to keep true:
 * **a database that has never hosted a booted backend cannot accept a
 * transactional enqueue, and `installQueueSchema` is the one call that fixes
 * that.**
 *
 * That gap is not hypothetical. Until the installer existed the only thing that
 * created the schema was a side effect of `makeWorkerUtils` — reached from the
 * non-transactional enqueue path and from `startWorkers()`, and from nowhere
 * else. So in a fresh worktree where `./singularity test` ran before
 * `./singularity build`, every `{ tx }` enqueue failed with a bare Postgres
 * `3F000` naming nothing in this repo — which four tasks-core tests hit and a
 * filed report mis-diagnosed as a fixture gap.
 *
 * The second describe pins the OTHER half of that story: the shape a worktree
 * database is now forked INTO. `ExcludeSchemaDataFromFork({ schema:
 * "graphile_worker", keep: ["migrations"] })` in `../index.ts` keeps graphile's
 * migration watermark and empties everything else, and the whole fork design
 * rests on graphile accepting that as already-installed. That claim is
 * graphile's behaviour, not the fork's, so it is checked here.
 *
 * Both arms run against a throwaway database (`db-test-fixture`), and the app's
 * migration chain is deliberately NOT run: the queue schema is graphile's own
 * and independent of ours, so a database with zero app tables is exactly the
 * right substrate for proving one call makes it enqueue-capable.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/infra/plugins/jobs`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

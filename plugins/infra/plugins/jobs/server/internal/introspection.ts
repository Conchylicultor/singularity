 * "Most severe" is the wait measured against the row's OWN class's pickup
 * target, not the raw wait: a `minutes` job waiting 4 min is inside its target,
 * an `instant` job waiting 2 min is at its deadline, and ordering by `run_at`
 * alone would list the first and hide the second. Because every class's
 * deadline is the same multiple of its target (`core/hold.ts`), this ratio
 * orders by severity without this file knowing any threshold.

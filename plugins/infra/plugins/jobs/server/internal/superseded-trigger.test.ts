/**
 * Real-DB regression suite for the superseded-row trigger: **a row graphile
 * retires while it is LOCKED is marked superseded and is not a dead job; a row
 * it retires while UNLOCKED is not marked and stays dead.**
 *
 * The second half is the one that matters most. graphile retires every
 * unavailable row that shares a re-queued key, dead-lettered ones included, so a
 * signature looser than "was locked when retired" would let the next cron tick
 * of a genuinely failing job wipe it from the dead list. The negative arm below
 * is what proves real dead-letters stay visible.
 *
 * Rows are written through graphile's own SQL — `add_job` via the registry's
 * transactional enqueue, and `remove_job` — never by hand-writing the retire
 * UPDATE, so the suite tracks graphile's real behaviour across a version bump.
 * The graphile runtime's own row writes (fetch, fail) are reproduced as the
 * UPDATE shapes it issues (`dist/sql/getJob.js`, `dist/sql/failJob.js`), because
 * no worker runs in this process.
 *
 * Runs against a throwaway database (`db-test-fixture`); the app's migration
 * chain is not needed — the queue schema is graphile's own.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/infra/plugins/jobs`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

// **FORFEIT IS ACCOUNTING, NOT RECOVERY.**
//
// Nothing in this file reclaims anything. No job row is touched, no advisory
// lock is released, no handler is stopped, nothing is retried. A forfeited slot
// is a slot we have written off for the life of this process, and the zombie
// holding it goes on holding it — which is exactly the property that keeps the
// design safe. Its advisory lock is still held by this live backend, so the
// stuck-lock sweeper provably will not reclaim its row and graphile cannot hand
// that row to a second worker.
//
// If you are here to "fix" forfeit into a reclaim: that change re-creates the
// bug this plugin's whole liveness design exists to prevent. Releasing the lock
// (or clearing `locked_at`) lets the sweeper reclaim a row whose handler is
// still running, and graphile then re-dispatches a possibly non-idempotent
// handler alongside its own zombie. The previous age-based lease did precisely
// that and stole ~25 live jobs in 8 days. A running promise cannot be
// un-awaited; the abort in deadline.ts is the only lever there is, and this
// file is what we do when the lever did not work.
//
// What the accounting buys is a question we could not otherwise answer: **how
// many slots does this runner actually still have?** That is what the floor
// check below reads, and what Debug → Queue shows as `forfeited`.

// The server half of the join vocabulary (`core/internal/joins.ts`): renders a

// question every routed shape asks of a SQL fragment — WHICH relations does it
// read? That answer is read off the rendered drizzle SQL itself (the columns
// and tables it embeds), never declared beside it, so a tuple's read-set and
// the SQL it runs cannot disagree:
//
// - a join's columns render against its ALIAS (`"playback"."last_played_at"`),
//   the base table's against its own name, so every column chunk names its
//   relation;
// - a relation the fragment reads that is neither the base nor a declared join
//   throws — a table a routed compile reads must be one it routes (the runtime's
//   drift guard, A8, catches only what a load actually captured).
//
// Raw SQL text (`sql.raw`) carries no column objects and is invisible here; a
// routed compile's SQL is built from drizzle columns. The one exception is an
// AGGREGATE (`JoinPlan.renderAggregate`): a grouped value a raw shape reads off
// a CTE or a rollup by name, whose provenance — the relation columns it is
// computed from — is declared when it is rendered, and read from there.

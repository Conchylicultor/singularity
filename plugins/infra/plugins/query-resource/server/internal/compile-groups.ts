//   SELECT col AS value, count(*) AS count FROM <table> WHERE <where>
//   GROUP BY col ORDER BY count(*) DESC, col ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT n
//
// ROUTED like the window and point siblings it serves beside, through the
// non-keyed `reach` arm: one `full` route on the base table and one per
// declared join (`./routes`, `./joins`), so a write to a table a grouping reads
// recomputes it and a write to any other table reaches none — without
// depending on a captured read-set. A grouping reads a join only when its
// grouped column or its `where` references it (or it is a required lookup): a
// 1:1 LEFT join that nothing references changes no count, so it is not joined,
// and its writes reach none of those tuples. Rendered here, beside the window
// compiler, so the relations its SQL reads and the ones its routes name come
// from one declaration.
//
// Split like the window compiler (`./arm-plan`): `planGroupArm` plans one
// relation set — its routes, each tuple's reads and the SQL it renders — and
// `compileArmGroups` turns arms into the loader and the reach plan.
// `compileGroupsQuery` is the 1-arm case.

// Every table a grouping reads can move its counts, so every use is membership.

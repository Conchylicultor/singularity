 * The SQL a union arm projects its row key with: `'<kind>:' || <id>::text` —
 * byte-equal to `armKeyCodec(kind).encode(String(id))` for the id's text form
 * (what the change feed sends as `ids`, and what a reverse probe answers), so
 * a key the compiler projects and a key a route encodes can never disagree
 * (`arm-key-sql.test.ts` runs both against Postgres).
 *
 * Server-side, unlike the codec (core, browser-safe): it renders drizzle SQL.
 * The kind is inlined as a literal — `armKeyCodec` has checked it against
 * `KIND_RE` (no quote can reach the SQL), and a constant keeps every arm's
 * statement one plan whatever its params.

/**
 * Real-DB suite for the attachment-link reconcile (`applyLinkDiff`, the body of
 * `AttachmentLink.setMany` / `.set`). Headless: provisions a throwaway Postgres
 * (db-test-fixture), applies the REAL migration chain, and drives the
 * db-parametrized reconcile against a real link table — so the composite PK,
 * the batched `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` insert and the pair-wise `or(...)` delete
 * are exercised as production runs them, not as a fake `db` would report them.
 *
 * The load-bearing case is `issues NO write statements when nothing changed`:
 * the reconcile is bound to a ~1 s text-projection settle that touches no
 * attachment at all, so an unchanged page must cost one indexed SELECT and
 * nothing else. A statement-counting proxy is what makes "nothing else"
 * observable — row state alone cannot tell a skipped DELETE apart from a
 * delete-nothing one, and the STATEMENT-level change-feed trigger cannot
 * either, which is exactly why the distinction matters.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/infra/plugins/attachments`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

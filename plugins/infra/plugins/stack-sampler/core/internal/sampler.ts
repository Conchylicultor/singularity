// The ONE owner of bun:jsc's sampling profiler. Everything a caller would
// otherwise re-learn about the API lives here, once:
//
// - It runs on its OWN thread, so it keeps sampling the armed thread's JS stack
//   DURING a synchronous block — the exact window where an on-demand "start
//   profiling" request could never be processed. That is the whole point.
// - It samples ONLY the thread/VM that armed it. A Worker busy for 600 ms added
//   zero samples to the main thread's buffer, so off-thread work is invisible
//   here by construction, not free.
// - `startSamplingProfiler(optionalDirectory?)`'s only argument is an output
//   DIRECTORY. It is not a sample interval; passing a number is meaningless, so
//   it is called with none.
// - There is NO stop. Arming is a one-way latch for the process's lifetime; a
//   consumer that is done simply stops reading, and the sampler thread idles.
// - Reading `samplingProfilerStackTraces()` DRAINS the buffer: it returns only
//   the samples taken since the previous read. A reader that drains once per
//   tick therefore gets exactly the samples of that tick's window, and after a
//   block the late tick gets the whole block. It is also why this plugin
//   refuses a second owner (see `claimStackSampler`).
// - The observed rate varies — ~40 Hz in a CLI probe, ~230 Hz on the main
//   backend — and the returned `interval` (0.001) does not describe it. A
//   consumer derives the rate from samples / window; never assume one.
// - An idle thread yields NO traces at all (not empty ones): one second parked
//   in the event loop drained zero samples.
//
// `samplingProfilerStackTraces` exists at runtime but is absent from bun-types
// (1.3.x), so it is declared here. Its return is declared `unknown` on purpose:
// the observed shape is `{ interval, traces: [{ timestamp, frames: [{ sourceID,
// name, location, sourceURL?, line, column, category, flags }] }] }`, but no
// type verifies it, so the one path from it to a typed value is
// `normalizeTraces`, which checks what it reads.

/**
 * The generic "trashed → undoable" seam: run a trashing mutation and put it on
 * the tab's undo stack. Every trash source shares the same shape — the mutation
 * returns a {@link TrashOutcome} handle, undo is
 * `POST /api/trash/:sourceId/:entryId/restore`, and redo re-runs the mutation —
 * so the plugin that owns the concept owns the seam, and no consumer hand-rolls
 * restore.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const trashWithUndo = useUndoableTrash();
 * await trashWithUndo({
 *   label: `Delete ${title}`,
 *   trash: () => fetchEndpoint(deletePage, { id: pageId }),
 *   onUndo: () => openPane(pageDetailPane, { pageId }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Notes on the two load-bearing details:
 *
 * - **Plain `useUndoRedo()`, never the scoped variant.** The recorded thunks are
 *   pure server calls keyed by a ledger id — valid anywhere in the tab — so the
 *   entry rightly outlives the pane/mount that recorded it (delete a page,
 *   navigate away, Cmd+Z still restores it).
 * - **Redo REASSIGNS the entry id.** A redo re-trashes, which mints a *new*
 *   ledger row; keeping the original id would make the next undo restore an
 *   already-consumed entry and take the primitive's typed 404.
 *
 * A `trashed: false` outcome records nothing — the domain hard-deleted, and
 * there is genuinely nothing to restore. It is returned to the caller honestly
 * rather than papered over.
 *
 * This plugin deliberately raises no toast and performs no navigation (that
 * would invert `infra → shell`): the consumer owns both.

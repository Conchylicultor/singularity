/**
 * Provenance for a request, and for the durable writes it causes.
 *
 * The two headers are stamped on every request an automated browser session
 * issues — set once in the e2e harness's `withBrowser`, which applies them to
 * the whole browser context, so they cover the SPA's own `fetch` calls too and
 * no script has to opt in. See
 * `research/2026-07-29-global-agent-origin-provenance-for-pages.md`.
 *
 * They were spelled out independently in three places before this plugin
 * existed (the harness, the pages agent-origin create-hook, and prose); a
 * third consumer made that a "these must agree" invariant with nothing
 * enforcing it. This is the one spelling, and the one reading.
 *
 * Deliberately a leaf: string literals plus one `Request` header read, no
 * `node:*` and no db, so every runtime that needs it can import it — including
 * `e2e`, whose boundary grants `core` barrels only.

/**
 * Pre-write snapshots of every file an agent-origin request overwrote, so the
 * e2e harness can put them back.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Some UI state is written straight into the user's durable data. A DataView
 * writes its per-view-instance sort / filter / groupBy back through config_v2;
 * a prototype's option picker writes the shared picks record. So an e2e script
 * that clicks "Group by Kind" to verify grouping works leaves the running
 * surface grouped for the user — and poisons its own next run's baseline, which
 * is how this was found (a "0 expanded elements" baseline became 44, so the
 * assertion saw 44 → 44 and failed, looking exactly like a product bug).
 *
 * Design docs:
 * `research/2026-08-30-global-agent-config-write-revert-ledger.md` (the
 * original, config-only ledger) and
 * `research/2026-09-16-global-shared-prototype-option-picks.md` § 4 (this
 * generalization, made when a second domain needed it).
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * A domain calls {@link defineAgentWriteLedger} once, at its module eval, and
 * gets a `record` / `noteComplete` handle for its write paths. The ledger owns
 * capture and persistence and knows nothing about the domain: an entry is an
 * opaque `key` plus a named set of files (`Record<K, FileSnapshot>`), and the
 * per-entry apply step — putting the bytes back AND re-syncing whatever cache
 * the domain keeps over them — is the domain's own `restore`.
 *
 * ## Why a module-level registry, not a contribution slot
 *
 * The registry is only READ when a request arrives (the two `/api/agent-writes`
 * routes), which is after the whole plugin graph has loaded — so every
 * `defineAgentWriteLedger` call has already run, whatever order the owners
 * loaded in. A slot would add a load-wave ordering edge for no reader that
 * needs one. (The design doc's original objection was to a slot for a single
 * contributor; with a registry, no load order is load-bearing at all.)

// A dangling trigger is a row whose `jobName` is not in the live job registry —

// retry storm that motivated this sweep (`improve.apply-queue-top` ×589 dead
// jobs) is exactly that: a deleted job whose trigger row outlived it.
//
// `sweepStaleTriggers` reconciles them at boot in a single atomic pass per
// table — `DELETE … RETURNING jobName`, so what we report is precisely what we
// removed (no find-then-sweep TOCTOU where a row could be reported-but-kept or
// swept-but-unreported). It runs in the events plugin's `onReady`, after the
// register phase has fully populated the job registry, so the "not registered"
// test reflects the complete job set. Deletion is surfaced loudly — a silent
// boot delete would hide the signal that a job was removed without cleaning up

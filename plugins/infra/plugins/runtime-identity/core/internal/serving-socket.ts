// ── The serving socket: which Unix socket THIS BACKEND answers on ────────────
//
// The second thing the gateway hands a backend at its entry point, beside its
// namespace. Only the gateway knows it: a backend alternates between
// `<ns>.sock` and `<ns>.next.sock` across hot restarts, so the path cannot be
// derived from the namespace.
//
// It arrives as `--socket <path>` on argv, and only there. It used to arrive in
// the environment, and an environment variable reaches every descendant: the
// tmux server when a backend was the first to talk to it, a toolbar build, a
// supervised-exec child, the release and deploy CLIs — each of them "knew" a
// socket that belonged to somebody else, and an exec child that bound it would
// have collided with the live backend. Deleting the variable after reading it
// does not help: a Bun child with no explicit `env` receives the environment the
// process STARTED with, whatever `process.env` says by then.
// `launcher:per-process-env-on-argv` keeps the old name out of code.

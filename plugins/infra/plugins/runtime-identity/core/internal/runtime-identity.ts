// ── The runtime namespace: which app THIS PROCESS is ─────────────────────────
//
// Two identities look alike and are not. This module owns the first:
//
// - RUNTIME namespace — the namespace a backend (or an `exec` child) serves.
//   Only its SPAWNER knows it: a composition backend runs out of main's
//   checkout, so nothing about the process's own filesystem can answer it. It
//   arrives as `--namespace <ns>` on argv and is declared here, once, at the
//   entry point.
// - CHECKOUT name — which checkout a CLI is acting on, derived from its git
//   root (`checkoutWorktreeName(root)` / `checkoutNamespace(root)` in
//   `@plugins/infra/plugins/paths/core`). A CLI process has no runtime
//   namespace at all and must never ask for one.
//
// The value used to ride in `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE`, and an environment variable
// reaches every descendant forever. Main's backend was the first process to talk
// to the tmux server after a restart, so the tmux server kept main's
// environment, and from then on every agent session — and every `build`,
// `check` and `test` an agent ran — believed it was main. Nothing chose that
// value. Module state cannot be inherited, which is the whole point of putting
// the answer here instead.

/**
 * The listen address of a launched app, and its ONE runtime authority.
 *
 * A released bundle's listen address can be expressed in exactly two places:
 * `RELEASE.json`'s `port` (the build's default, which is what makes a bundle
 * runnable by double-click with no environment at all) and `SINGULARITY_LISTEN`
 * (the runtime override). Nothing else.
 *
 * `SINGULARITY_LISTEN` replaced the older `PORT` override rather than joining
 * it. `PORT` was a strictly weaker form of the same knob — no bind host — and
 * the bind host is the whole point: a deployment sits behind Caddy on loopback,
 * and "the gateway is not reachable off-box" must be a property of how it was
 * started, not of whether someone also remembered a firewall rule. Two knobs
 * for one value would let the weaker one win by accident.

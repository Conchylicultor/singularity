/**
 * The gateway as a per-user launchd service (macOS) — what makes the app come
 * back after a reboot.
 *
 * A LaunchAgent in the user's `gui/<uid>` domain, not a boot-time LaunchDaemon:
 * the secrets master key lives in the login keychain, locked until the user
 * logs in, and the runtime is one instance per user anyway. So the gateway —
 * and through its supervisor Postgres, PgBouncer and every backend — starts at
 * login (immediately with auto-login) and is relaunched by launchd if it dies.
 *
 * launchd runs at most one instance of a label, so a restart through it can
 * never overlap two gateway generations.

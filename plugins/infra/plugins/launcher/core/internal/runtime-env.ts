// What environment does the runtime tree start from?
//
// The runtime tree is the gateway and everything it starts: every backend
// (main, central, each worktree), each zero-cache, and Postgres / PgBouncer.
// It used to start from whatever its STARTER happened to carry. The launcher
// spawned the gateway with `{ ...process.env }`, and the gateway handed every
// child its own `os.Environ()` plus a few additions. So `./singularity start`
// run from an agent shell gave every backend on the host that shell's
// SINGULARITY_CONVERSATION_ID, its TMUX socket and its CLAUDE_* session
// variables (observed 2026-09-15). Every op-log record and every commit a
// backend's build made was then stamped with one agent's conversation, and
// tmux clients the backend ran talked to whichever tmux server the starter was
// inside instead of the default one.
//
// So what travels is DECLARED here, as a closed list. The launcher spawns the
// gateway with exactly this subset of its own environment (`pickRuntimeEnv`),
// and passes the names as the gateway's required `-child-env` flag
// (`runtimeEnvNames`). The gateway holds no list of its own: it forwards to its
// children only the names this file declares, plus what it sets per child
// (ZERO_* for a zero-cache). That makes two boundaries, starter → gateway and
// gateway → child, and one declaration for both.
//
// An allowlist, not a denylist of known-bad names: what a starter's environment
// may carry is an open set, so naming the bad ones only ever catches the last
// leak somebody noticed. The agent pane already works this way, one level
// down: runtime-tmux/server/internal/agent-session-env.ts rebuilds each pane's
// environment from a closed list under `env -i`.
//
// Deliberately NOT on the list:
//
// - Session and terminal state: TMUX*, CLAUDE*, TERM*, WARP_*, SSH_*, XPC_*,
//   SECURITYSESSIONID. They describe the starter's terminal, not the host. The
//   keychain works without them (secrets use the native keyring addon), and
//   agent panes already run `claude` under `env -i`.
// - SOCKET_PATH: a backend's socket is per process, so it travels on the
//   backend's argv (`--socket`), where no descendant inherits it.
// - PG*: the database location is declared in `database.json`. libpq lets the
//   environment win over that file, so a stray PGHOST in the starting shell
//   would silently point a toolbar build's readiness probes at another server.
// - EQUIN_RELEASE_DIR: set by the systemd unit, but read only by the release
//   self-extractor, before the launcher runs. No runtime reads it.
// - Toolchain variables (GOROOT, CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_*, HOMEBREW_*, __MISE_SHIM):
//   PATH is forwarded, and each tool either defaults these or recomputes them
//   from its own install location.
//
// PATH is the one forwarded name that is not passed through verbatim: mise's
// resolved per-version tool directories are stripped from it, so the runtime
// tree resolves its tools through mise's shims and obeys the committed
// `mise.toml` rather than a version frozen into the starter's shell. See
// `normalizeRuntimePath`.
//
// Every SINGULARITY_* name the code reads or sets must appear in
// RUNTIME_FORWARDED_ENV or RUNTIME_WITHHELD_ENV (or match a forwarded prefix),
// and every name listed here must still be read or set somewhere. The
// `launcher:runtime-env-declared` check enforces both, so a new variable cannot
// be added without deciding whether it travels, and a dead one cannot linger.
// (The retired SINGULARITY_WORKTREE is not listed: the namespace-identity lint
// rule bans that name outright.)

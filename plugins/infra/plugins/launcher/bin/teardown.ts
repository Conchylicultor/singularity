/**
 * Release teardown — the compiled `teardown` binary, the bundle's stop entrypoint.
 *
 * Mirror of `launch.ts`'s env-rooting preamble, then stops the self-contained
 * stack (gateway → PgBouncer → Postgres) via the pidfiles under the data root.
 * It only signals pidfiles — it does NOT delete the data dir — so a packaged
 * install's songs/DB persist across app restarts.
 *
 * Invoked by the desktop (Tauri) shell on app exit with the SAME `SINGULARITY_DIR`
 * / `SINGULARITY_LISTEN` env the launcher saw, so it tears down exactly the stack
 * `launch` brought up. The gateway / Postgres are detached daemons (not the shell's
 * children), so pidfile-based teardown is the authoritative stop.
 *
 * CRITICAL ordering (same as launch.ts): set the path env BEFORE importing
 * anything path-dependent, then `await import(...)` so the constants freeze under
 * the release root.

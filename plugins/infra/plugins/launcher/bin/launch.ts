/**
 * Release launcher — the compiled `launch` binary, the artifact's entrypoint.
 *
 * Compiled by `release.ts` via `bun build --compile` and placed at the bundle
 * root, next to `gateway/`, `server`, `web/`, `pg/`, `pgbouncer/`, and
 * `RELEASE.json`. Running it brings up the whole self-contained app on a fresh
 * host with no bun, no Go toolchain, and no node_modules.
 *
 * CRITICAL ordering: some path constants are FROZEN at import time from the env
 * vars set below, so this file must set them BEFORE importing anything
 * path-dependent. We therefore do NOT statically import the launcher boot code —
 * we `await import(...)` it only after the env is in place, so those constants
 * freeze under the release root.
 *
 * `@plugins/infra/plugins/paths` no longer contributes to this: `dataRoot()`,
 * `worktreesDir()`, `repoConfigDir()` and `webDistDir()` are all functions, and
 * `DataDir.path` is a getter, so nothing there captures an env read. What still
 * freezes is the embedded-PG family — `PG_PORT`, `PG_SOCKET_DIR` and the paths
 * derived from them (`database/embedded/shared/internal/paths.ts`) are
 * module-level consts over `SINGULARITY_PG_PORT` / `SINGULARITY_PG_SOCKET_DIR`.
 * One frozen constant anywhere in the closure is enough to make the ordering
 * load-bearing, so keep the dynamic import until that family is lazy too.

// The HUMAN-FACING spelling of the singularity data dirs — what a message, a
// UI empty state, or an agent prompt writes when it tells somebody where a
// directory is. The twin of the resolved absolute paths in
// `paths/core/internal/paths.ts`: same directory, written the way a person
// types it (`~`), not the way the filesystem answers (`/Users/<you>/…`).
//
// Kept as literals rather than derived from `PROTOTYPES_DIR`, because the
// derivation would go the wrong way: `PROTOTYPES_DIR` is already expanded, and
// re-shortening it back to `~` would be a second, lossier spelling — and it
// would drag `homedir()` into every consumer. These two files sit side by side
// in one plugin family so a change to either is read against the other.
//
// NOTHING here may import `node:*` or the sibling `paths` module. This plugin
// exists precisely so the browser can name the directory: a `~` string is
// runtime-agnostic, `homedir()` is not.

//
//   which namespace is THIS BACKEND the server for?  `currentWorktreeName()`
//     — the `SINGULARITY_WORKTREE` the gateway spawned it with, and correct
//       only in a gateway-spawned backend. A process that merely INHERITED the
//       variable (every agent pane does, through the tmux server) is answered
//       `singularity` from inside any worktree.
//   which namespace does THIS CHECKOUT own?           `checkoutNamespace(root)`
//     — minted from git, and true whether or not anything is deployed.
//   which deploy did this checkout PUBLISH?           this file.
//
// The third is the one a script that wants to DRIVE the app is asking, and it
// cannot be derived from either of the other two: a checkout that has never been
// built serves nothing, and a `--composition` build publishes a namespace whose
// name shares no label with the checkout's own. It was recorded at mint time
// instead — every deploy writes `spec.json` with the absolute path of the
// checkout whose backend answers it (`writeWorktreeSpec`, from
// `deployNamespace`) — so the answer is a read, not a guess. `namespaceFor`'s
// own docblock states the rule this rests on: provenance on disk cannot be
// ambiguous, a name can.
//
// Sync, git-free and env-free (beyond the data root every path here shares), so
// an e2e script can resolve its target before it has launched anything.

 * the best identity available, and it is the form both sides fall back to, so
 * they still agree. Anything else (EACCES, a symlink loop, an I/O error) is a

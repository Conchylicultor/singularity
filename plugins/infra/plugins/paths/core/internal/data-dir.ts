// wrote `join(SINGULARITY_DIR, "<whatever>")`. Nothing ever read the directory
// as a whole, so nine orphaned entries (~1 GB) accumulated with zero references
// left in the repo, ten `<name>-slots` dirs were minted by ONE primitive, and
// ~7 GB of pure cache sat indistinguishable from the only copy of a secret.
//
// `defineDataDir` makes each directory a declaration with an owner, a purpose
// and a reclaim policy, keyed under a CLOSED set of top-level kinds. The
// registry is then enumerable, which is what lets `paths:no-undeclared-data-dirs`
// diff the real filesystem against it and fail on the next orphan on the day it

 *   lives inside it, in a `subdir()` area — never in a second `apps/*` dir, and
 *   never in a `state/*` dir beside it (`paths:app-data-dirs` enforces both).
 * - `worktrees` — the existing per-worktree layout, unchanged
 * - `services` — long-lived service state (postgres, sockets, …)
 * - `state` — durable app state that is the only copy (config, secrets, releases)
 * - `cache` — rebuilt on demand; the whole kind is reclaimable wholesale
 * - `locks` — cross-process lock/slot files; reclaimable once nothing is running
 * - `logs` — append-only observability output
 * - `deprecated` — quarantine for entries with no live owner
 *
 * Adding a kind is a reviewed edit to this array — that is the point. A kind is

 * moved, and `{ from: "apps/wallpaper", to: "wallpaper" }` on `apps/desktop`
 * says the old dir became the `wallpaper` area of the new one.
 *
 * **Resolution does the move, not a script.** Every read of `.path`, `.file()`,
 * `.ensure()` and a `subdir()` handle resolves through the move first, so no
 * consumer can ever read the new location while the bytes still sit at the old
 * one:
 *
 * - **Settled** — `from` is absent or is a symlink: the new location.
 *   Memoized per (data root, move), so steady state costs nothing.
 * - **Pending** — `from` is a real directory and the destination is absent. The
 *   host singleton running merged code (see `mayMoveSharedData`) performs the
 *   move once: `rename` (atomic), then a relative symlink at `from`. Every other
 *   process resolves to the OLD location and moves nothing.
 * - **Conflict** — `from` is a real directory AND the destination exists: a
 *   split copy. Throws, naming both paths. Either side may hold the only copy of
 *   something, and there is no automatic merge that could be right.
 *
 * Why a declaration and not another `LEGACY_LAYOUT` row: that table is
 * top-level only, self-liquidating ("nothing may be added"), and its script
 * refuses to run while a gateway is alive — it was built for one flag day, not
 * for the next time an owner relocates a directory. A move recorded on the
 * declaration itself travels with the code that needs it, runs on every root
 * the code ever meets (dev, a release, a fresh install), and is deleted with a
 * one-line edit once every live checkout reads the new spot.
 *
 * Why only the host singleton moves: building or testing an unmerged branch
 * must never mutate the root every other checkout shares. The move lands when
 * main restarts on the merged code, and until then the branch's own processes
 * read the old bytes in place.
 *
 * Why the symlink: an older checkout still running pre-move code keeps

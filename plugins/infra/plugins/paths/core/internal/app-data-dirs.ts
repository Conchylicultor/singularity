// The rules behind `paths:app-data-dirs`, as PURE functions over literals.
//
// The rule they enforce: each app owns exactly one data dir, `apps/<app>/`, and
// everything that app keeps durably — its own content and each of its
// sub-plugins' — lives inside it. The type system carries the first half:
// `defineDataDir` refuses the `apps` kind, so an `apps/*` dir can only be spelled
// through `defineAppDataDir(app, …)`. What a type cannot see is WHERE that call
// sits and WHICH app it names — `{ id: "prototype-history" }` is a perfectly
// good `AppIdentity` — so the rest is a check that pairs every declaration with
// the plugin that made it.
//
// The miss that motivated this: an agent designing prototype version history
// proposed `apps/prototype-history` beside `apps/prototypes`, and nothing
// flagged it. Rule A is the answer to that; rule B closes the `state/` escape
// route beside it; C and D keep the pairing itself honest.
//
// Pure so every rule is tested on hand-built literals, the way
// `legacy-layout.test.ts` tests the migration planner. The check supplies the
// facts: which `data-dirs/index.ts` default-exported which spec (by calling
// each generated entry's loader itself), and where the declaring calls sit.

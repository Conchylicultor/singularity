// `defineDataDir` registry is one branch's view of that root. The two have
// different lifetimes, and comparing them directly is what made
// `paths:no-undeclared-data-dirs` fail a worktree's build on
// `state/agent-write-ledger` — a directory a concurrently-running agent's
// branch had declared correctly and not yet merged (2026-08-30, worktree
// `att-1788099811-aioc`). The failure was unactionable by construction: the
// directory belonged to another live session, so there was nothing safe to
// delete and nothing legitimate to declare.
//
// The repair is to make the RULE as host-global as its subject. Each namespace
// publishes what it declares to its own `worktreeArtifacts.dataDirs(...)`, and
// the audit reads the union — so an entry another live worktree owns is
// recognised as owned rather than reported as an orphan.

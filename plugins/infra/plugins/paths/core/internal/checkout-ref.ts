 * questions, both answered from provenance rather than from a name:
 *
 * 1. Is `root` its repository's main checkout? A git question
 *    (`getMainRepoRoot`): comparing a basename against the literal
 *    `"singularity"` is only correct while the repo happens to be cloned into a
 *    directory of that name.
 * 2. Is that repository the one this data root's main app is served from? The
 *    data root serves ONE instance (research/2026-07-02-global-adr-single-
 *    instance-per-user.md), recorded by the `spec.json` its main build wrote
 *    (`mainNamespaceOwner`). Without this, the main checkout of ANY clone on
 *    the machine — a second copy, an e2e's temp repo — minted `singularity` and
 *    ran its ops, logs and deploys as main's. Such a checkout is named like any
 *    other non-main one, by its basename, and one whose basename IS the main
 *    namespace is refused ({@link MainNamespaceCollisionError}).
 *
 * Async because the answer comes from git. `getMainRepoRoot` is memoized per
 * cwd, so repeated calls cost one spawn per process.

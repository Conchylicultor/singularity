//      VERIFIES it: a legacy name passes only if it is the compatibility symlink
//      pointing at its declared target (or, for a transient/quarantined row,
//      absent). A legacy name sitting there as a real directory after the move
//      is a failure, not a tolerated leftover.
//   2. `paths/scripts/migrate-data-layout.ts` executes them.
//
// The migration cannot read its plan from the registry, because the same change
// DELETES every temporary `legacyLocation` block — the registry describes where
// things will be, this table describes where they are. That asymmetry is why the
// table exists at all, and why it is written out by hand rather than derived.

// with `defineDataDir`, or an orphan for `deprecated/`.

// The check that reads the data root AS A WHOLE. Nothing ever did, which is why
// `~/.singularity/` accreted 60-odd top-level entries — nine of them orphans
// with zero references left in the repo, ~1 GB, discovered a year late by a
// hand audit rather than by anything that runs.
//
// The two checks above are grep checks over the tree: they police how the repo
// SPELLS a path. This one polices the filesystem the repo WRITES TO, which is
// state no tree scan can see. Hence `scope: "deploy"` — the verdict is not a
// function of the working-tree hash, so it owes a `cacheSignature()` (asserted
// at load in `checks/core/runner.ts`) that folds in everything it reads.
//
// Three rules, in one pass over one observation of the root:
//
//   1. **Top level.** Every entry is one of the closed set of KINDS, a
//      permanently-grandfathered live service (a declaration carrying a
//      `legacyLocation`), OS noise, or a name `LEGACY_LAYOUT` accounts for.
//   2. **The legacy names are VERIFIED, not tolerated.** There is no
//      hand-written allowlist any more: the grandfathered set is derived from
//      `LEGACY_LAYOUT` (`core/internal/legacy-layout.ts`) — the same table the
//      one-off migrate script executes, so the to-do list and the migration plan
//      are literally the same fact and cannot drift. A legacy name passes only
//      if it is what its own row says it must be: the compatibility SYMLINK
//      resolving to its declared target; absent (for a quarantined row, for an
//      `unshimmable` row whose writer unlinks, and for any row whose shim the
//      drop-legacy pass has already removed); or the plain FILE pre-move code
//      keeps putting back, for an `unshimmable` row whose writer replaces the
//      name and where no shim can therefore hold. A legacy name still sitting
//      there as a real directory is a FAILURE — the old allowlist would have
//      stayed green through exactly that, which is how a "shrinking to-do list"
//      can shrink to nothing on paper while nothing has moved on disk.
//   3. **Second level.** Every entry inside a kind directory is itself a
//      declared `${kind}/${name}`. Without this the check goes vacuous the
//      moment the top level is seven kind dirs: `state` is a kind, so a
//      hand-made `state/foo` would pass rule 1 forever.
//
//      The one other thing that may sit there is a declared MOVE's old location
//      (`movedFrom.from` on some declaration — see `MovedFrom` in
//      `core/internal/data-dir.ts`), verified the way rule 2 verifies a legacy
//      name: the symlink the move planted, resolving to its destination; or,
//      while the move is pending (main has not booted on the merged code yet),
//      the real directory with its destination still absent. A real directory
//      with its destination ALSO present is a split copy and fails. This runs
//      before the foreign-manifest attribution, so a move's own old name is
//      judged by the move rather than excused by some older checkout that still
//      declares it.
//
// "DECLARED" MEANS DECLARED ON THIS MACHINE, not declared in this checkout.
// Rules 1 and 3 both read the union of this checkout's registry and every other
// live namespace's published manifest (`core/internal/data-dirs-manifest.ts`).
// The root is host-global — it holds the union of every branch that has ever run
// here — while a checkout's registry is one branch's view, and comparing those
// two directly is a category error: it reported `state/agent-write-ledger`, a
// directory a concurrently-running agent's correct-but-unmerged branch had just
// created, as an orphan, and failed the deploy of a worktree that could neither
// delete it nor declare it. An entry another live namespace owns is now logged
// as owned. What reaches the offender list is an entry NOBODY on this machine
// declares, which is the orphan this check has always been about.
//
// Rules 2 and 3's second half are self-liquidating: when every legacy name has
// drained, `LEGACY_LAYOUT`, the migrate script and rule 2 are deleted together.

//
// Two ways back to a joinable root, and both are closed here:
//
//   1. **Joining `dataRoot()`.** The root is reachable as a plain string —
//      that is unavoidable, since a child process has to be handed one — so the
//      constraint cannot live in the type. `join(dataRoot(), "whatever")` is
//      precisely what `defineDataDir` exists to replace.
//   2. **Re-reading `SINGULARITY_DIR` from the environment.** A second
//      derivation of the root, in a plugin that owns none of it. This is the
//      form the deleted `SINGULARITY_DIR` const would come back as: not an
//      import (that is now a tsc error), but four characters of `process.env`.
//
// A WRITE to the env var is untouched — `??=`, `=`, and a `SINGULARITY_DIR:`
// key inside an `env: {…}` object are how a root is handed to a child, which is
// the sanctioned direction. Only reads are policed, which is why the pattern
// carries a negative lookahead for an assignment rather than matching the name.

// One data dir per app, `apps/<app>/`, holding everything that app keeps
// durably. `defineDataDir` refusing the `apps` kind is the type-level half; this
// is the half a type cannot see — WHERE each declaration is made, and whether
// the app it names is the app it is made from. The rules themselves are pure
// and live in `core/internal/app-data-dirs.ts`; this check only gathers facts.
//
// Unlike `no-undeclared-data-dirs` it reads no filesystem state, only the tree:
// the declarations (each generated entry's module, evaluated) and the call
// sites (grep). So it is `scope: "tree"` and runs in every build, check and
// push — the moment a second `apps/*` dir is written, not after it exists on
// somebody's disk.
//
// Each entry's loader is called HERE rather than read back off the registry,
// because the registry has forgotten who declared what: pairing an item with
// the entry whose default export listed it is the only way to know its real
// declaring plugin, which is what rules A–C are about.

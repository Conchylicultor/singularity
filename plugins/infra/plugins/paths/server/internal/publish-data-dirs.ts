 * Publish what THIS namespace declares under the shared data root, so an audit
 * running in another checkout can tell one of this branch's directories from an
 * orphan. See `core/internal/data-dirs-manifest.ts` for why that is needed at
 * all.
 *
 * The backend is the writer because it is the process that actually CREATES
 * these directories: a namespace that can write to the root is exactly a
 * namespace whose backend has run. It is deliberately not a `defineWarmup` —
 * a warm-up is documented as "an OPTIMIZATION, never a correctness dependency"
 * whose throw is logged and skipped, and a namespace that silently fails to
 * publish has its live directories reported as another checkout's orphans.
 *
 * Loading the collected dir EVALUATES each owner's `data-dirs/index.ts`, which
 * is what populates the registry — the same call, with the same arguments, that
 * `paths:no-undeclared-data-dirs` makes. The registry alone is not enough: it
 * holds only the declarations whose module some running code happened to import,
 * so a namespace would under-publish exactly the directories nothing had touched
 * yet.

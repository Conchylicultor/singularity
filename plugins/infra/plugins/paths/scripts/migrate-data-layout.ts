/**
 * One-time repair: move the singularity data root onto the declared
 * `<kind>/<name>` layout that `defineDataDir` describes but the disk never had.
 *
 * Two passes, because a bare rename breaks every worktree still running pre-move
 * code — its backend keeps naming the old path:
 *
 *   pass 1 (`--apply`)        rename the bytes to `<kind>/<name>`, then SYMLINK
 *                             the old name at the new one. Exactly one copy of
 *                             the bytes; old code reaches it through the shim.
 *   pass 2 (`--drop-legacy`)  once every worktree has rebuilt, delete the shims
 *                             and sweep the strays the shim scheme can leave.
 *
 * The DECISION is not here. `planMigration()` (pure, unit-tested, beside the
 * `LEGACY_LAYOUT` table in `paths/core/internal/legacy-layout.ts`) turns
 * filesystem facts into a list of steps; this script reads the facts, prints the
 * steps, and — only when asked — executes them. Rename, never copy.
 *
 * Not a CLI command, deliberately: this is a historical repair that becomes a
 * no-op the moment it has run, not a capability the tool should carry forever.
 * It is deleted together with the table and `planMigration` once every root has
 * been migrated. Same shape as `server-core/scripts/backfill-pushes.ts`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun plugins/infra/plugins/paths/scripts/migrate-data-layout.ts                # dry run
 *   bun plugins/infra/plugins/paths/scripts/migrate-data-layout.ts --apply        # pass 1
 *   bun plugins/infra/plugins/paths/scripts/migrate-data-layout.ts --drop-legacy  # pass 2
 *
 * No flag prints BOTH passes' plans and touches nothing. Pass 2 deletes things,
 * so it gets a reviewable dry run too — and there is no `--dry-run
 * --drop-legacy` spelling to get wrong. Pass 2 is planned against the state
 * pass 1 WOULD LEAVE (simulated in memory, since `planMigration` is pure), not
 * against the root as it is now: on an un-migrated root pass 2 reads the
 * original files as strays, which is the opposite of predictive.
 *
 * `--apply` REFUSES while a gateway is alive. There is no `--force`: the gateway
 * holds sockets and pidfiles under the very entries being renamed, and "I know
 * what I'm doing" is not a thing a flag can check.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, in the other direction: the `logs/` staging dance refuses on
 * any child that is not a plain FILE, because the gateway writes only
 * `<worktree>.log` and its rotations. A non-gateway PLAIN FILE therefore passes
 * the test and is carried down into `logs/gateway/` with everything else —
 * nothing is lost, but it is misfiled. The launchd monitors' own logs did
 * exactly this on the first real run. Enumerating non-gateway filenames would
 * be the list-versus-invariant trap this check exists to avoid, so the
 * limitation is stated rather than patched.
 *
 * It also refuses, in EITHER pass and changing nothing, if anything already
 * occupies a `<kind>/<name>` destination. That is always new code writing to the
 * new layout on an un-migrated root, and there is no correct automatic answer —
 * so the refusal prints what is there, how big and how fresh it is, where the
 * real history still sits, and the exact `rm` line to review.
 *
 * And `--drop-legacy` refuses outright unless pass 1 has run: the passes have an
 * order, nothing else enforces it, and pass 2 on an un-migrated root would
 * delete originals it mistook for leftovers.

 * - `signed-out` — installed, but `claude auth status` says no account.
 * - `missing`    — no executable where it is looked for (`searched`).
 * - `unreadable` — the check itself failed (timed out, crashed, printed
 *                  something that is not its JSON). Not a verdict on Claude
 *                  Code: the app cannot tell, and says so.

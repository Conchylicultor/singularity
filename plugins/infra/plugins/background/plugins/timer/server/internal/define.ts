 * call site is listed, with its reason, in this plugin's lint allowlist.
 *
 * Every tick is a `timer:<name>` span, recorded in memory (last run, failures,
 * a recent ring) and listed under Timers in Debug → Background activity. A
 * throwing tick is recorded as failed and rethrown as an unhandled rejection,
 * which the reports plugin files.

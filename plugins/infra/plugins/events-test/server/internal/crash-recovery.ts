// End-to-end check that job liveness is EXACT — both halves of it.
//
// A running job's worker is "alive" iff it still holds a session-scoped Postgres
// advisory lock keyed on the graphile job id (`withJobLock`, jobs/job-lock.ts).
// Postgres releases that lock during backend teardown, so it vanishes the instant
// the owning process dies — SIGKILL, OOM-killer, panic, `process.exit()` alike —
// and cannot be forged by a frozen clock or a sleeping host. The stuck-lock
// sweeper reclaims a locked row only when that lock is genuinely absent.
//
// Both halves matter, and one run of this endpoint asserts both, in order:
//
//   1. NO-STEAL (negative) — the lock is held by a LIVE connection ⇒ the sweeper
//      leaves the row completely alone, however long it has been locked.
//   2. RECLAIM (positive) — that connection dies ⇒ the sweeper reclaims the row
//      and the handler actually re-runs.
//
// The negative case is the important one. The mechanism this replaced was a
// 5-minute timestamp lease, and *its* harness synthesized a stuck row with
// `UPDATE ... locked_at = now() - interval '6 minutes'` — a test of a timestamp
// comparison, nothing more. It could not express "held by someone still alive",
// so it passed for three months while every job that ran longer than five minutes
// (nightly backups, DB forks, `./singularity push`) had its row stolen and
// re-dispatched CONCURRENTLY with the still-running handler. Case 1 is the
// assertion that bug could not survive: the row here is two minutes "overdue" by
// every timestamp measure and must still not be touched.
//
// Setup is a real simulated death, not a forged one: a dedicated direct-Postgres
// client takes the advisory lock and then has its socket destroyed underneath it.
// `locked_at` is still back-dated — but only past the sweeper's 30-second
// *acquisition* grace (the window between graphile's `get_job` stamping the row
// and `withJobLock` taking the lock), which is a constant of the dispatch path and
// never a statement about how long a handler may run.
//
// NOTE: Not using implement() because retryUntil and error paths return raw Response objects.

// The forged lock age. Must clear the sweeper's LOCK_ACQUIRE_GRACE (30s) so the
// grace is not what the assertions are measuring — in both cases the row is
// unambiguously past it, and only the advisory lock decides the outcome.

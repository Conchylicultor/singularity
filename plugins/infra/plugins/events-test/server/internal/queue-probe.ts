// Raw reads of graphile's own tables, shared by the two queue-level endpoints.

// The jobs plugin's public introspection (`queryRunningJobs`) is the right read
// for LIVENESS and is used for exactly that — but it says nothing about queues,
// because nothing in the app has needed to ask until now. So the two facts these
// tests are about — which serialization queue a row landed in, and whether that
// queue is locked — are read here, in one place, rather than re-typed per
// endpoint. `crash-recovery.ts` already reaches into `_private_jobs` the same way
// to find the row it just enqueued.

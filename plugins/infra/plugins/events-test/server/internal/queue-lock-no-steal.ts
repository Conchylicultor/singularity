// The queue-level twin of `crash-recovery.ts`, and the assertion that guards the
// riskiest part of the `serial` design.
//
// `serial` made the stuck-lock sweeper responsible for a second lock. graphile
// releases a queue's lock in its own success/fail handlers, which a SIGKILLed
// worker never reaches — and graphile's own recovery for that hardcodes four
// hours (`resetLockedAt.js:12`). So without a sweep, the first crash after
// adopting named queues leaves a lane locked and every job in it unrunnable for
// four hours. Hence `sweepOnce()` now clears `_private_job_queues` too.
//
// That is a reclaim, and a reclaim of the wrong row is corruption: clear the lock
// on a queue whose job is genuinely still running, and a second job enters the
// queue alongside it — the serialization guarantee gone, silently. It is the same
// class of bug as the 5-minute timestamp lease that stole ~25 live jobs in 8 days
// (research/2026-07-30-jobs-exact-liveness-advisory-locks.md). So the queue sweep
// is gated on the same evidence as the job sweep — no session holds an advisory
// lock over any of the queue's own jobs — and never on the age of `q.locked_at`.
//
// One run asserts both halves, in order:
//
//   1. NO-STEAL (negative) — a queue whose job's advisory lock is held by a LIVE
//      connection survives a forced sweep, however long it has been locked, and
//      no second job in that queue is fetched. This is the important one.
//   2. RECLAIM (positive) — that connection dies ⇒ the sweep frees the queue and
//      the job waiting behind it runs.
//
// The setup mirrors crash-recovery's exactly: a dedicated direct-Postgres client
// takes the advisory lock and later has its socket destroyed underneath it, and
// `locked_at` is back-dated only past the sweeper's 30-second ACQUISITION grace —
// the window between graphile's `get_job` stamping the row and `withJobLock`
// taking the lock. Back-dating is what stops the grace from being what the
// assertions measure: in both halves the queue is unambiguously past it, so only
// the advisory lock decides the outcome.
//
// NOTE: not using implement() — the assertions return raw Response objects.

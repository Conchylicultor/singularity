// soon as the rows are durable. Nothing is asserted; the point is to look at
// the health report's Job queue row (and Debug → Queue) turn amber, then watch
// it return to green as the sleepers drain.
//
// Everything goes through `enqueue()`. The rows land on the task and priority
// their hold class declares, exactly like production work, so what the
// observability sees is the real reservation — not a hand-typed insert that

// saturation run would sit for the rest of every sleeper's `sleepMs`. Plugin
// `onShutdown` hooks run concurrently, so this fires while the jobs plugin's
// `stopWorkers()` is waiting on these very handlers.

// occupy a slot while this process is alive, so there is nothing to retry and

// End-to-end check that a SUPERSEDED row is dropped, not dead-lettered — the
// incident of 2026-09-12 replayed on purpose (research/
// 2026-09-15-jobs-superseded-rows-are-not-dead.md).
//
// What happened then: a deploy restarted the backend while the hourly worktree
// reaper was mid-run. Its startup code queued the reaper again under the same
// key before the stuck-lock sweeper noticed the dead worker, so graphile's
// `add_jobs` retired the running row (`key = null, attempts = max_attempts`) and
// inserted a fresh one. The sweeper then RELEASED the retired row, which left it
// exactly the shape of a dead job — archived, reported as `queue-dead-job`, and
// counted amber in the health row — although a newer run finished the work two
// minutes later.
//
// One run asserts, in order:
//
//   1. SUPERSEDE (setup) — a keyed row locked by a live stand-in worker is
//      retired by graphile when the same key is queued again.
//   2. NO-STEAL (negative) — a superseded row whose advisory lock is still held
//      is a live run, and a forced sweep must leave it alone.
//   3. DROP (positive) — the holder dies ⇒ the forced sweep DELETES the row. A
//      row that is still there, unlocked, is the old behaviour ("reclaimed …
//      re-queueing"), and is the regression this endpoint exists to catch.
//   4. NOT DEAD — no row of this job appears among dead jobs (live or archived)
//      since the run started, through the jobs plugin's own public read.
//   5. SUCCESSOR — the newer row runs to completion, and the retired one never
//      runs at all.
//
// The stand-in worker is crash-recovery's: a dedicated direct-Postgres client
// takes the advisory lock and later has its socket destroyed. A real handler
// cannot be used as the victim, because its lock lives on the jobs plugin's own
// connection, which this harness has no business killing.
//
// The real-dead-letter half (a DEAD row re-queued under its key stays dead) is
// not repeated here: asserting it end to end would leave a genuine dead job on
// the deploy, reported and archived like any other. It is pinned on a throwaway
// database instead, in jobs/server/internal/superseded-trigger.test.ts.
//
// NOTE: not using implement() — the assertions return raw Response objects.

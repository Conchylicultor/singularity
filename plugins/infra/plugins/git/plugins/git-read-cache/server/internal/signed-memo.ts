 *
 * `createGitStateMemo.get(key, signatureFn, computeFn)` takes both functions
 * *per call*, so two call sites can pass functions that disagree about what
 * "current" means. A resource's `revalidate` and its `loader` are exactly two
 * such call sites, and that is how `edited-files` drifted: `revalidate` probed
 * git directly while the loader's memo keyed on a watcher generation counter, so
 * a fresh ETag certified a stale value — a permanent client-side stale pin
 * (`invalidate`-mode pushes carry no value, so nothing could heal it).
 *
 * Here `signature` and `compute` come from one object: `memo.signature` feeds
 * `revalidate`, `memo.get` feeds the `loader`, and they cannot diverge because
 * there is nothing to pass. Divergence becomes structurally unrepresentable
 * rather than a comment two files apart. That is the enforcement
 * `createGitStateMemo` lacks.
 *
 * Everything else — the `Map<key, {signature, value}>` cache, the embedded
 * per-key `createInflight` single-flight, the `chargeWait` hit/miss/coalesce
 * markers, the ≤1-event staleness-sharing contract of a mid-flight joiner — is
 * `createGitStateMemo`'s, unchanged: this is a thin binding wrapper over exactly
 * one cache implementation.

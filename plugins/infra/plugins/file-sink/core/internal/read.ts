 *

 * absent slot or once the byte budget is exhausted. The chunks are concatenated
 * OLDEST-FIRST so line order stays chronological, and the leading partial line is
 * dropped only for the OLDEST file actually opened (the only one whose read can
 * have started mid-line).
 *
 * This is safe because of an invariant of the writer: **a line is never split
 * across a rotation.** `append()` writes one whole `line + "\n"` per call, and
 * rotation happens BETWEEN appends (the size gate runs before the write, and the
 * post-rotation line goes wholly into the fresh live file). So concatenating the
 * files reproduces the original line stream exactly — no line needs rejoining
 * across a file boundary.

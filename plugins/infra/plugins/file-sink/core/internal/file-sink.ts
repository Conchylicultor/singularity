// THE one write path: `append(line)` is `appendLines(path, [line], …)` and

// size gate — two copies of the gate is exactly how the "a line is never split
// across a rotation" invariant would drift between the singular and the batch
// form.
//
// The gate runs per ROTATION GROUP — not per batch, not per line. Lines
// accumulate until the next one would cross `maxBytes`; that group goes out as
// ONE `appendFileSync`, and only then does the file rotate. Byte-for-byte what
// `for (const l of lines) append(l)` produces, with the writes coalesced. Four
// properties follow, and readers depend on them:
//
//   - Every `appendFileSync` payload is a whole number of "\n"-terminated lines,
//     and a rotation only ever happens BETWEEN two of them. That is precisely
//     what `readTail({ includeRotated: true })`'s stitching relies on: a line is
//     never split across a rotation, batch or no batch.
//   - A batch larger than `maxBytes` performs several rotations inside the one
//     call and `keep` stays a hard cap — identical to looping `append` today.
//   - `fileBytes` is updated immediately after each successful write and zeroed
//     immediately after each rotation, so a mid-batch ENOSPC leaves the counter
//     describing exactly what is on disk.
//   - The `size + groupBytes > 0` half of the gate is a DELIBERATE behaviour
//     change from the old per-line gate: a single line larger than `maxBytes`
//     going into an empty (or absent) live file is written whole, without first
//     burning a rotation slot on a no-op rename chain that would evict real
//     history to make room for nothing. Reachable only in that degenerate case —
//     the line is oversized either way, so the choice is whether to also lose a

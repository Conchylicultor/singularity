 * The ONE hermetic OpenSSH invocation. `sshRun` and `sshUpload` are both thin
 * wrappers over `runHermetic`, and differ only in the program name, the
 * trailing positional arguments, and two documented constants.
 *
 * That is the whole point of this file. The isolation flags below are
 * security-critical — they are what makes "this key reaches this host" a fact
 * the caller proved rather than something the machine's own ambient credentials
 * arranged — and a second copy of them for `scp` would be a second place for
 * one to be dropped. Here there is no second copy: the key materialization, the
 * option block, the host-key policy and the failure classification exist once,
 * so `scp` cannot drift from `ssh`.
 *
 * The key is materialized into a `mkdtemp` scratch dir at mode 0600 and the
 * whole dir is `rm -rf`'d in `finally`, the same shape (and the same lifetime
 * discipline) as the existing `ssh-keygen` helper in deploy/servers.

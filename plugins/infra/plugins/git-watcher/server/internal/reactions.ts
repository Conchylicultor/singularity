/**
 * An IN-PROCESS reaction to a ref advance, run by the watcher itself.
 *
 * This plugin now offers two signals for the same advance, and picking the wrong
 * one is a real bug class:
 *
 * - `refAdvanced` is the DURABLE signal. It emits a trigger event, which enqueues
 *   a job, which runs in the backend's shared graphile pool. Use it for work that
 *   must survive a crash, may be slow, or wants retries. It is also `isMain()`-
 *   gated: the event only ever exists in the main backend's database.
 * - A REACTION is the in-process signal. It runs on the watcher's own callback,
 *   in EVERY backend, with nothing between the ref moving and the reaction
 *   running. Use it for a cheap, idempotent refresh whose correctness is
 *   independently guaranteed by an on-read fallback — and which therefore must
 *   not be able to queue behind unrelated work.
 *
 * A reaction that needs durability is a job in disguise: it has no retry, no
 * persistence, and it is skipped entirely while the backend is down. The pushes
 * ledger qualifies because `ensurePushLedgerFresh()` re-derives it on read and at
 * boot, so a missed reaction costs latency, never correctness.
 *
 * A reaction that throws is reported (never swallowed) and does not stop its
 * siblings or the durable emit — again, because the pull path is what makes the
 * push path optional.

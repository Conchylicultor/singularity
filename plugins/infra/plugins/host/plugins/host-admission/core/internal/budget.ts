/**
 * One type-check-class worker's resident set — the RAM quantum, and since
 * 2026-09-09 the ONLY term that sizes the elastic fleet.
 *
 * **This constant alone determines `B`**, hence how many heavy workers (tsc,
 * vite, a nested check's children) may run at once across every backend on the
 * box. Nothing subtracts from the ceiling any more — host pools declare a
 * cardinality cap and make no claim on a budget — so a change here moves the
 * fleet ceiling directly and visibly, with nothing else to hide behind.
 *
 * **`3.6e9` is not a fresh measurement.** It is chosen so the memory-only
 * formula lands on the `B` the old reserved-subtraction formula produced
 * (`floor(34.36e9 / 3.6e9) = 9`), which is what keeps the removal of the CPU
 * reservation structural rather than a re-tuning in disguise. `B = 9` holds for
 * any quantum in `(3.436e9, 3.818e9]`, and `3.6e9` sits near the centre of that
 * interval — 0.54 above the `B = 9` boundary, 0.46 below `B = 10` — so a small
 * change in host memory or in the ceiling fraction cannot flip it. (`3.8e9` also
 * gives 9 but sits 0.04 from flipping to 8; do not use it.)
 *
 * It is nonetheless better justified than the `2.7e9` it replaces. **First
 * measured 2026-07-12** (Stage-1 instrumentation; before that the constant was
 * inherited, never observed). The headline finding is that this class has NO
 * single value — a worker's peak swings up to **3×** on whether tsc's
 * `.tsbuildinfo` is warm:
 *
 * | worker      | warm   | cold   |
 * |-------------|--------|--------|
 * | web-core    | 2.1 GB | 5.3 GB |
 * | test        | 1.9 GB | 5.1 GB |
 * | server-core | 1.3 GB | 3.9 GB |
 * | central-core| 1.3 GB | 3.8 GB |
 * | **8-worker fleet total** | **9.4 GB** | **22.6 GB** |
 *
 * **Size on COLD.** A fresh agent worktree has no `.cache/tsbuildinfo`, so its
 * first build is cold — and a fleet burst (many agents building at once) is
 * therefore dominated by cold builds. That is exactly the regime that thrashed
 * the host on 2026-07-11. Sizing on warm numbers would be sizing for the case
 * that never hurts.
 *
 * Against cold, across the 7 real tsc targets (web-core 5.3, test 5.1,
 * server-core 3.9, central-core 3.8, tooling 1.8, cli 1.2, tools 1.0 GB): the
 * **mean** is 3.16 GB and `2.7e9` sat *below* it, while `3.6e9` sits above it
 * with ~14 % headroom. But the **tail** (5.3 GB) is still ~1.5× the quantum — so
 * `B × PER_UNIT_BYTES` models the MEAN and carries no tail headroom, and ONE
 * cold build's 8-worker fan-out (~22.6 GB) is already 66 % of
 * `hostRamCeiling()`. Whether to (a) raise the quantum to the tail (`5.3e9` ⇒
 * `B = 6`, a large throughput cost), (b) keep a mean quantum and reserve
 * headroom, or (c) replace the uniform quantum with per-class weights, is the
 * open Stage-2 question in
 * `research/2026-07-12-global-host-admission-memory-dimension.md` — do NOT
 * re-tune this ad hoc.
 *
 * One caveat for whoever picks that up: Stage 2 §2.1 proposed a
 * `reservedRamCost()` **mirroring** `reservedCpuCost()`, and the latter no longer
 * exists — pools reserve nothing, so there is no reserved term to carve a RAM
 * twin out of. The question survives intact; its proposed mechanism does not, and
 * needs re-deriving against this memory-only formula. See
 * `research/2026-09-09-global-host-pools-stop-reserving-cpu.md`.
 *
 * Note `vite` (3.0e9–3.5e9) also fits inside this quantum, but a build runs
 * exactly ONE vite and MANY workers — so the count asymmetry means the worker
 * distribution, not vite, governs the fleet's memory.
 *
 * Units are DECIMAL bytes — the `maxRSS` log lines that calibrate it are decimal
 * too (a GiB/GB mismatch here silently understates the true peak by ~7 %).

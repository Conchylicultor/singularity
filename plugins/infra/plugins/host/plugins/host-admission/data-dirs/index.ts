// Every host pool's flock slot files, declared HERE rather than derived inside

//
// This is the fix for the single worst offender in the old data root:
// `createHostSemaphore` used to do ``join(SINGULARITY_DIR, `${name}-slots`)``
// itself, so ONE primitive silently minted a top-level directory per pool — ten
// on disk, of which only seven had a live `defineHostPool`. Nothing could see
// that, because the paths existed only as a template literal inside a function.
//
// The pool set is NOT a second list: it is `HOST_POOLS` (the pool table, the one
// place a non-CPU pool is declared) plus `cpu`, which is the elastic fleet and
// therefore never appears in that table. A new pool added to the table gets its
// lock dir here with no edit; a pool that is NOT in the table has no lock dir and
// `defineHostPool` refuses to build it, which is the same structural bar
// `host-budget` already enforces from the other side.

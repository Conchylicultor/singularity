 * The push mutex of a repository that is NOT the one this machine's main app is

 * `pushPool` does (writes to one repository's `main`), scoped to that
 * repository: its slot lives in the repository's own git dir
 * (`<gitCommonDir>/singularity-locks/push/`), so such a push neither queues the
 * machine's real pushes behind its check pass nor waits behind theirs.
 *
 * Declared here, beside `pushPool`, so every push mutex comes from this plugin.

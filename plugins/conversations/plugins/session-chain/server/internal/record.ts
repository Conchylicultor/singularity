 *
 * Append-only: never UPDATEs, never DELETEs.
 *
 * Race safety is CONSTRAINT-based, not read-then-write: the tail probe is a
 * cheap fast path, and the insert is guarded by the UNIQUE (conversation_id,
 * claude_session_id) index via ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING. Two ticks (or two
 * processes) that both observe the same new id therefore cannot both append —
 * the loser writes nothing rather than racing on a stale read. This also means
 * a session id that flaps away and back never re-enters the chain: its position
 * stays pinned at first-seen, which is what the transcript merge wants (first
 * occurrence wins, original timestamps survive).
 *
 * `conn` is injectable so DB-backed tests can drive a throwaway database.

/**
 * The one exit-drop policy, shared by every conversation-close path that can set
 * `task.dropped`: the manual "Drop & Close" exit-menu action and the
 * agent-driven `exit_clean` flow. A conversation that closes without landing any
 * work returns its task to `dropped` rather than leaving it stranded as
 * `attempted`.
 *
 * Never drop when work is at stake OR unmeasurable:
 *
 * - **Unknown state is not a licence to drop a task.** `getAttemptWork` returns a
 *   `Resolvable`, and its unresolved arm means the standing could not be
 *   measured at all (the attempt row is gone). Leaving the task as `attempted`
 *   is recoverable by a human; dropping work we cannot account for is not.
 * - **The standing is git-measured, so it cannot lag behind a background job.**
 *   This guard used to live in `tasks-core` and read the `pushes` ledger, where
 *   an empty result was taken as proof that nothing was pushed. That ledger is
 *   written by the `tasks.push-ingest` job; when the job lags, the table is
 *   empty for work already merged into `main`, and an agent that pushed and then
 *   exited cleanly had its task dropped with no UI involved.
 * - **`standingOf` is a discriminated value, not a count.** There is no array
 *   here whose emptiness could be misread, and the drop is reachable only from a
 *   measured `"none"`.
 *
 * Design: research/2026-08-17-global-attempt-work-git-derived-standing.md.
 *
 * `conversation.attemptId` is a non-nullable `string` column, so there is no
 * "conversation without an attempt" case to route around — a missing attempt ROW
 * surfaces as the unresolved arm above, which is already non-droppable.
 *
 * Returns whether the task was dropped.

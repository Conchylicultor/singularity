/**
 * The `useCombinedResources({ work, hasSibling, files })` result. Imported
 * type-only, so the derivation (and its test) stay pure — no React, no
 * live-state runtime. (`standingOf` is a pure function over the payload, so
 * importing it costs nothing at runtime.)
 *
 * Three structural echoes of the readiness/value gate:
 * - Three states, never two: `loading` (nothing known yet), `error` (one of
 *   the reads failed — the combine's precedence is error > loading > ready), and
 *   `ready`, whose value is one the server currently vouches for.
 * - `files` is the edited-files `Resolvable` payload (spelled structurally to
 *   keep the live-state import out): the loader returns a first-class
 *   "no trustworthy worktree" non-value instead of lying with `[]`.
 * - `work` is the attempt-standing `Resolvable`, in the same shape and for the
 *   same reason. It replaces what used to be a `pushes` array, and that swap is
 *   the whole point of this file: an empty array of push rows was read as proof
 *   that the attempt had pushed nothing, but those rows are written by a
 *   background ingest job that can lag arbitrarily far behind git. "No rows
 *   ingested yet" and "nothing was pushed" were the same value, so a
 *   conversation whose branch was already merged into `main` was offered the
 *   destructive "Drop & Close" as fact. The standing is now measured from git,
 *   and it arrives either measured or as an explicit non-value — there is no
 *   array here whose emptiness can be misread.

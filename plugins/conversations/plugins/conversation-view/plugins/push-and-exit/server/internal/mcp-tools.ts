// push-and-exit flow. The toolbar button just fires the wrap-up prompt
// (fire-and-forget) — there is no job row; the conversation's own status
// drives the button state.
//
// `exit_clean` marks the conversation close-requested and enqueues a finalize
// job that waits for end_turn before tearing down the runtime — calling
// `deleteConversation` here would yank the tmux session out from under a
// still-streaming response. `flag_raise` is a pure no-op signal: the
// conversation stays open (returns to `waiting`) and the flag text is rendered
// inline in the transcript by the flag-raise tool-call renderer.
//
// Both handlers are callable outside the toolbar-initiated flow so the model
// can call them in response to an explicit "Exit" instruction.

# op-status

Surfaces the worktree's in-flight long-running operation (build / push / check /
test / e2e) in two places:

- a **banner** above the prompt input, and
- a compact **sidebar row chip** (one icon per kind, an hourglass while parked
  in a wait), so an op is visible from the conversation list without opening
  the conversation.

A web-only plugin: it reads the op-store's `opsInFlight` live collection
(`debug/profiling/op-log/plugins/op-store/core`) — the DB fold of `op-log.jsonl`
— and owns no server state. Plan:
`research/2026-09-29-global-unified-op-status.md` §6.

## How it works

- **One subscription.** `useOpsInFlight()` is `useLive(opsInFlight)` with the
  default tuple — every in-flight op on the host, boot-preloaded so the banner
  and chips paint settled. The banner and every chip share it and filter by
  worktree slug on the client (`opSlugOf(row)`: `opSlug`, else the last
  segment of a legacy line's branch). The slug of a conversation is
  `basename(worktreePath)`.
- **Which op a worktree shows** (`opsOfSlug`): by `OP_RANK` (push > check >
  build > test / e2e), then oldest. The banner adds `+N others` for the rest of
  the host's in-flight ops.
- **The state line** (`stateLine`, `web/internal/op-lines.ts`) is the one
  wording every surface renders:
  - parked in a wait (`openWait != null`): `{Kind} — {WAIT_KINDS[kind].sentence(reason)}`,
    `· requeue #N` when the wait's cycle is past 0, then the wait's own clock —
    e.g. `Build — held: host under duress (loadRatio) · requeue #6 · 12:03`;
  - working: `{Kind} — {progressive}` (`Build — Building`).

  The right side is the op's total elapsed. The banner's **warning tone means
  "parked in a wait"**, before the grant or after it (a build waiting on the
  duress valve after its lock is as stuck as one waiting for the lock).
- **The expanded list** is a DataView (`conversations.op-status.queue`, one
  compact table view grouped by `section`, authored in
  `config/conversations/conversation-view/op-status/`). The banner card is the
  DataView's **hosted toolbar frame** (`OpStatusCard`): the header line folds
  the list and, while expanded, carries its one options trigger (search,
  filter, sort); the op, clock and fold state reach the frame through
  `BannerChromeContext`. `buildSections` stays the order authority — the
  section holding this worktree's op first, then `OP_KINDS` order — and is
  flattened into rows in that order (the config's sort is `[]`, and the
  `section` enum lists its options in section order, so groups follow it). The
  **Push queue** section reconstructs the global queue with positions: `1` the
  push holding the mutex (`grantedAt` set), then the pushes parked on the mutex
  by `openWait.startedAt`, then any push not at the mutex yet. Every other
  section reads working → held → queued, then by `requestedAt`. Columns: a
  phase glyph (`phaseOf`: spinner = working, hollow dot = **queued** in an
  ordinary line, warning hourglass = **held** by the duress valve — the one
  phase that also says so in words, in its own column), the push position, the
  title, and **waited** / **worked** (`liveTimes`). Only the clocks have column
  headers (`FieldDef.header: false` on the rest), placed once on the first
  section header (`columnHeader: "first-group"`). The title cell's tooltip is
  the full state line and split. The current worktree's op is the selected
  (highlighted) row; titles come from `useConversationTitleBySlug()`
  (`conversations/web`), falling back to the slug. Activating a row opens the
  op detail pane (`debug/profiling/ops`); the hover action opens another row's
  conversation.
- **The chip** (`Item.Chips`) reads the same subscription through
  `useWorktreeOp(conversationId)`, a `ResourceResult<OpRow | null>`: loading or
  failed never reads as "idle". It shows the hourglass whenever the op is
  parked in a wait, else the kind's icon (wrench = build, up-arrow = push,
  flask = check, checklist = test, open-in-browser = e2e); the tooltip is the
  state line, ticking only while the tooltip is open.
- **Clocks** are a presentational 1 s `useNow` ticker; the op state itself is
  pushed by the change feed on `op_log_ops`.

The kinds, nouns and busy verbs are `OP_KINDS` (`infra/worktree/core`); the
chip's `Record<OpKind, IconRef>` and `OP_RANK` are type errors until a new kind
has an entry.

## Verifying it end to end

`e2e/op-status-waits.ts` drives a synthetic op through the real writers and
asserts what the banner, the sidebar chip and the op detail pane show at each
state (parked on the duress valve at requeue #2 → working → completed, then a
SIGKILLed op with no terminal). The op is `scripts/synthetic-op.ts`, a separate
process, because an `e2e` script may not import `server` barrels and because
killing a real process is the honest way to test a death. Its steps are driven
by a control file it watches. The interrupted close of the killed op is appended only by MAIN's
reconciler, so that assertion runs only with `--main-reconciles`; without it the
script says so, skips it, and closes the dead op through the helper's `close`
mode (the reconciler's own terminal event) so no dead row lingers.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Banner above the prompt input showing the worktree's in-flight op (build / push / check / test / e2e) from the op-store in-flight collection: the wait it is parked in (reason, requeue cycle, its own clock) or the work it is doing, total elapsed and the waited / worked split, expandable into a grouped table (DataView) of the global push queue and every other in-flight op, each row opening its op detail pane. Also a sidebar row chip flagging the same op (hourglass while parked in a wait).

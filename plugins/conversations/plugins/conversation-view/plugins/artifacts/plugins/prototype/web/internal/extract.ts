 * scan means.
 *
 * - A `prototype new` command **created** what it printed.
 * - A `Write`/`Edit` whose path is inside a prototype's folder **edited** it.
 * - Every other mention — a `Read`, a `Bash` line, the prompt of an `Agent`
 *   call, a bare id in the agent's or the user's own words — **referenced** it.
 *
 * The same call can be all three at once, and each id is judged on its own: a
 * `Write` into one prototype whose content quotes another's id edited the first
 * and only referenced the second.
 *
 * One event, not the whole transcript: the host runs this per event and folds
 * the repeats, keeping the strongest relation anyone reported.

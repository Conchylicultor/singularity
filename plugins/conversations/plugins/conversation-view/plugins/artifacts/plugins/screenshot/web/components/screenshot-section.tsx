 * The pictures the conversation looked at, four to a row.

 * A picture is its own label, so this kind does not list rows: a thumbnail grid
 * says in one glance what a column of file names cannot. The file name is the
 * tooltip, and the full-window viewer shows it in its top bar.
 *
 * The whole grid is ONE `ImageGallery`, so opening any thumbnail lets ← / →
 * walk the conversation's other screenshots without going back to the popover.
 *
 * The popover deliberately stays open underneath. The viewer renders inside
 * this section's React tree (that is how `ViewerThumbnail` keeps a popover from
 * reading the viewer's own clicks as an outside press), so dismissing the
 * popover would unmount the viewer the click just opened. Closing the viewer
 * lands the reader back on the grid, which is where they would want to pick the
 * next picture anyway.

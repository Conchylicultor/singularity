    "Singularity pages as a conversation artifact: every page the transcript's edit_page / write_agent_note / read_page calls acted on, listed as a row that opens the page beside the chat — or, for a call scoped to one block of a page, the block view. A write edited the page it wrote into and created every <agent-page> its report says it minted (each its own row), and a read referenced it. Keyed by the page id the apply report names, falling back to the block the call was scoped to; each key resolves through page-tree's useBlockTarget, titled with its page (and, for a block, its type's label).",

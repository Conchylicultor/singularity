/**
 * Drives the conversation toolbar's **Artifacts** button against the deployed
 * app — the "Verification" step of
 * `research/2026-09-19-conversations-artifacts-popover.md`.
 *
 * Four claims, none of which a unit test over the extractors can make, because
 * each one is about the HOST rather than about any one kind:
 *
 *   1. the closed button carries a count, and that count is the number of
 *      artifacts the popover then lists under its PRODUCED kinds — a host that
 *      counted from the merged hits but dropped a kind while rendering would
 *      still show "12", and one that counted the pictures the agent merely
 *      looked at would overstate what the conversation made;
 *   2. every heading in the panel is a registered kind, and they appear in
 *      registry order — the popover names no kind, so a heading it invented, or
 *      an order of its own, is a bug in the host;
 *   3. the prototype and research sections are among them, which is what makes
 *      this conversation a meaningful subject at all;
 *   4. clicking a research row opens the doc in a file pane BESIDE the
 *      conversation (`mode: "push"`), and the transcript is still on screen.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this. After `./singularity build`:
 *
 *   ./singularity run \
 *     plugins/conversations/plugins/conversation-view/plugins/artifacts/e2e/artifacts-popover.ts \
 *     [--conv <conversationId>] [--out <prefix>] [--headed]

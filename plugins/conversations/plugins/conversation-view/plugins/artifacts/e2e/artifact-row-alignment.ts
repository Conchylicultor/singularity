/**
 * The artifacts row, measured where the complaint was made: in the deployed
 * app, against the real fonts.
 *
 * A user reported that the glyph and the title "are not aligned", and that the
 * title read too large. Both were true, and they were two different faults:
 *
 *   - the title had no declared size, so it inherited the document root (16px)
 *     in a panel whose own headings are 12px;
 *   - the truncating `<Text>` leaf was an `inline-block`, and an inline-level
 *     box whose overflow is hidden hands its line the bottom of its own margin
 *     box as a baseline — so the `<Fill>` cell around it still reserved room
 *     for the strut's descender underneath. The cell measured 30px for 24px of
 *     text, and the row's `items-center` dropped the glyph ~3px below the words.
 *
 * `layout-harness`'s `opticalCenter` invariant is what keeps the SECOND one
 * fixed, and it states the claim generically, on a synthetic row. This script
 * is the other half: it pins the claim on the real surface, with the real type
 * ramp, the real glyph and the real popover — the things a fixture stands in
 * for. A regression in either is worth knowing about separately.
 *
 * Optical centres, never box centres. A cell that is taller than its text
 * centres perfectly and still drops its siblings by half the extra height, so a
 * box-centre check is exactly the check that would have passed throughout.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this. After `./singularity build`:
 *
 *   ./singularity run \
 *     plugins/conversations/plugins/conversation-view/plugins/artifacts/e2e/artifact-row-alignment.ts \
 *     [--conv <conversationId>] [--out <prefix>] [--headed]

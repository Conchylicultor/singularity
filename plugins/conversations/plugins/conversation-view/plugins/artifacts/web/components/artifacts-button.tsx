/**
 * Toolbar button listing everything this conversation made, changed or looked

 *
 * Three states, and the first one matters: while the transcript is still
 * arriving the button is a plain disabled glyph with **no count**, because "0"
 * would be a claim about the user's work that reverses itself a moment later.
 * Once settled it opens whenever anything was found, and the closed button
 * says WHAT the conversation made: one glyph per kind it created or edited
 * something of, then ONE number for all of them — so "prototypes and pages,
 * three things" reads at a glance, without opening anything. Only `"produced"` kinds show there,
 * and only what was created or edited: the pictures it looked at, the skills
 * it loaded and the docs it merely read are listed in the panel but never on
 * the button (`ArtifactKind.origin`). A conversation that made nothing shows
 * the generic glyph alone, rather than a "0" the rows underneath contradict.

 * One artifact, on one line: the kind's glyph, what it is called, and a mark
 * for what the conversation did to it.
 *
 * It IS a {@link Row} — the primitive whose whole subject is this shape — and
 * not a line container dressed up as one. That is what makes the glyph track
 * the words (`Row` sizes any bare `<svg>` in its leading slot from the row's own
 * type rung), the title a declared size rather than whatever the popover
 * happened to inherit, and the focus ring the same one every other row in the
 * app paints.
 *
 * `hover="muted"` because this row lives on a popover panel, not in a sidebar:
 * the accent tint is the sidebar/menu treatment and reads as a selection here.
 *
 * Shared by every kind that lists rows, so a prototype line and a research line
 * cannot drift apart. A kind whose items want a different shape — thumbnails,
 * name chips — renders its own and reuses {@link RelationMarker} instead.
 *
 * A row the conversation only *looked at* is muted, which is the whole of the
 * "referenced" signal: no mark, quieter text.
 *
 * Activating a row also dismisses the popover it is in, so a kind cannot ship a
 * row that navigates and leaves the panel hanging over what it opened.

// or 1 row per conversation — its primary key IS the conversation — so it is a
// lookup-only collection: no default window (nothing lists every
// conversation's note), minting `conversation-notes:rows` alone. A reader
// takes its row with `useLiveRow(conversationNoteRows, conversationId)`, and
// `found: false` is "this conversation has no note". (The server table handle
// is `conversationNotes`, hence the `Rows` name.)
//
// Bounded by construction: only a mounted conversation subscribes, a load is
// one primary-key seek, and the `:rows` point routing schedules a note
// upsert / delete for the one conversation whose row it named. The row id is
// the extension's key, whose column is the side-table's `parent_id` PK.
//
// NOT preloaded (a lookup-only collection cannot be): the notes editor keeps
// serverNote="" during that one round-trip (the pending arm) so
// useEditableField always has a valid initial value, and its consumers gate on
// `pending`.

 * How one conversation's agents card is shown, shared by the card and the

 *
 * - `showAll` — list every agent the conversation launched, finished or not,
 *   and keep the card on screen with nothing running. Off, the card is the
 *   running-agents band: what is working now, and nothing when nothing is.
 * - `open` — the list is unfolded under the summary line.
 *
 * One localStorage-backed value per conversation: the two halves sit in
 * different slots of the pane (above the prompt box, and in the transcript's
 * overlay) with no common ancestor of their own, and `useDraft` keeps every
 * reader of one key in sync.

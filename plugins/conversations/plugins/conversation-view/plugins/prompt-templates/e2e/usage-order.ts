/**
 * Verifies the two halves of most-used ordering for the prompt-template chips:
 *
 *  1. **The freeze.** Using a template must NOT move it while the user is still
 *     in the same conversation — a chip that jumps out from under the cursor the
 *     instant it is clicked makes clicking two in a row a guessing game. This is
 *     the assertion that would silently regress if `useUsageOrder`'s ref snapshot
 *     were ever replaced by a plain derived sort.
 *  2. **The reorder.** A reload (a fresh resnapshot) must surface the used
 *     template first.
 *
 * Run against the current worktree's own deploy:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/conversations/plugins/conversation-view/plugins/prompt-templates/e2e/usage-order.ts --conv <id>
 *
 * `--clicks` must exceed the current leader's decayed score for assertion 2 to
 * mean anything; the default is deliberately generous.

 * the document is the genuine second surface: the collapsed `FloatingAction`
 * panel, which holds EVERY template — not just the pinned ones — inside a
 * `max-w-6` box, so its clipped chips overlap the strip and intercept clicks
 * aimed at it. `[hidden]` covers the bar's own parking dock, where a chip the
 * strip has no room for is kept alive off-layout.
 *
 * Both exclusions are DESCENDANT selectors (`:not([x] *)`), not attribute checks
 * on the button itself: `inert` sits on the panel wrapper and `hidden` on the
 * dock, several levels above the chip.

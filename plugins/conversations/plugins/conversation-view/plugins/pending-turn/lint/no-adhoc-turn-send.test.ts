/**
 * Tests for the `no-adhoc-turn-send` lint rule. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * The rule bans importing a turn-delivery endpoint into web code, which is how
 * a surface silently opts out of the pending-turn send lifecycle. It fires on
 * the import specifier (the binding a `fetchEndpoint` call would need), only in
 * files under a `web/` segment — server files legitimately implement these
 * routes, and the three sanctioned delivery modules are allowlisted in
 * `index.ts`'s `ignores`.

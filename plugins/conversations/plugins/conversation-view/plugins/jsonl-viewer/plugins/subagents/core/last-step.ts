 * `tool_use` it answers.** A result always lands immediately after its call, so
 * the newest line is a result about a third of the time at any live moment (348
 * of 992 sampled cut points across the 826 transcripts here) — and a result's
 * text is the payload, not a description. Reporting it literally put a file's
 * line-numbered contents on the card in place of "Read row-actions/CLAUDE.md".
 *
 * So when the newest classifiable line is a result, the scan keeps going for the
 * action that produced it. That action is in the same window 340 times out of
 * those 348, and only when it is not — 8 of 348 — does the bare `tool-result`
 * arm survive, saying that a call finished without pretending to know which.
 * Never `null` there: a sub-agent mid-tool-loop has plainly not "not started".
 *
 * Text and thinking still win outright when they are newest. Those are the
 * sub-agent speaking, which says more than any tool name — and they are only
 * skipped when they are OLDER than a trailing result, where reporting them would
 * mean quoting something the sub-agent said before the step it has since taken.

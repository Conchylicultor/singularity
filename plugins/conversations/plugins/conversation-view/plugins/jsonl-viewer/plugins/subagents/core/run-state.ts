/**
 * The ONE computation of a sub-agent's state, so the card, the pane title and
 * any future consumer cannot disagree.
 *
 * The PARENT transcript is the authority where it speaks, and differently per
 * request shape:
 *
 * - **foreground** — the parent's `tool_result` lands only at completion, so its
 *   presence means finished.
 * - **background** — that `tool_result` is an immediate "launched"
 *   acknowledgement and means nothing; completion arrives later as the
 *   `task-notification` carrying the same tool-use id.
 * - **unknown shape** (meta not landed) — neither signal can be trusted to mean
 *   completion, so fall through.
 *
 * Either completion is withdrawn by a later resume: a `SendMessage` to a
 * stopped sub-agent starts a new turn under the same id, and only the
 * notification that turn ends with (the newest one, joined by the agent's own
 * id since it carries the `SendMessage`'s tool-use id) finishes it again.
 *
 * Then the sub-agent's OWN transcript: the harness streams an assistant message
 * in pieces with `stop_reason: null`, and only the last piece of an ended turn
 * carries `end_turn`. For a sub-agent started by ANOTHER sub-agent this is the
 * only signal there is — its launching call and any notification live in the
 * spawner's transcript, never the conversation's — so without it such a
 * sub-agent read "running" until the whole conversation stopped. It is
 * positive-only (older Claude Code versions never wrote it), and a named
 * teammate woken by a later message appends a user line, which the next read
 * sees as an open turn again.
 *
 * A workflow agent (spawned by a `Workflow` run, not an `Agent` call) joins no
 * call and gets no notification of its own, so it has its own pair of signals,
 * one at each end of this order: its run's journal `result` line decides
 * FIRST — it is as authoritative as a foreground `tool_result` — and its run
 * having ended decides just before liveness, because a run that is over while
 * this agent never reported means the agent was cut off, whatever the parent
 * is doing now. It sits AFTER the agent's own turn end: an agent that closed its
 * turn finished, even if the journal line recording it never landed.
 *
 * A named teammate has one more: the `idle_notification` it sends its lead
 * when its turn is over. Its own `end_turn` marker is often missing (Claude
 * Code 2.1.29x writes a turn's last text piece with `stop_reason: null`), and
 * it gets no task-notification, so without this a teammate that had reported
 * and gone quiet read "running" for as long as its lead lived. It sits beside
 * the turn end, which it stands in for, and is withdrawn by anything the
 * teammate writes after it.
 *
 * Last, the parent's own liveness.
 *
 * Deliberately NO staleness timeout as a fourth answer: a sub-agent that has
 * written nothing for five minutes may be inside one long tool call, and a
 * timeout would turn that into a claim the code cannot support. Surfaces state
 * the observation instead ("no update in 4m", from `lastActivityAt`).

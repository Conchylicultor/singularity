 *
 * - **foreground** — the parent's `tool_result` is the call's RETURN VALUE, so
 *   it is the report, errors included (`toolResultIsOutcome`).
 * - **background** — that same `tool_result` is an immediate launch receipt
 *   ("Async agent launched successfully… agentId: …"), which the harness marks
 *   as internal metadata never to be surfaced. Showing it under the heading
 *   "Report" is wrong three times over: it is not the report, it is explicitly
 *   not for display, and it buries the work. The report is instead the last
 *   `SubagentHandback` call in the sub-agent's OWN transcript, whose `message`
 *   is the write-up it handed back.
 * - **unknown shape** — the `tool_result` could be either, and there is no way
 *   to tell which, so nothing is claimed.
 *
 * Measured over the 890 sub-agent meta files on this machine (2026-09-20):
 * a handback appears **only** under `background` (160 of 419), never under
 * `foreground` (0 of 8) and never where the shape is absent (0 of 396). So this
 * is genuinely per-shape — the two cases do not converge on one source — and a
 * background sub-agent from before the harness wrote handbacks (2026-09-15)
 * simply has no recoverable report. That is `none`, and the caller shows no
 * card: its transcript is already on screen underneath.

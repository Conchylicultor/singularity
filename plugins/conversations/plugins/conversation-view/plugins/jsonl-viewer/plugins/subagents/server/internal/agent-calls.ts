/**
 * Which name each `Agent` call in a conversation asked for — the half of the
 * join that lives in the PARENT transcript.
 *
 * A sub-agent spawned with a name is recorded as an in-process teammate and its
 * meta file carries no `toolUseId`, so the only thing tying it to the card on
 * screen is the name, and the card's side of that is the `name` in its own
 * `Agent` call's input. A surface rendering the card already holds that event
 * and can pass it straight to `describedSubagent`; the `subagent-transcript`
 * resource cannot, because a resource is handed only a tool-use id — so it
 * reads it back from here.
 *
 * **Raw lines, not built events.** `readChainLines` parses one JSON object per
 * line and stops; `readJsonlEventsFromChain` would additionally pair tool
 * results, unwrap relay envelopes, decode attachments and run an XML parser over
 * every user turn. We want six characters out of a tool-use block.
 *
 * Memoized on the parent chain's own signature, so the multi-megabyte read
 * happens once per parent write rather than once per sub-agent append — and the
 * signature is a faithful function of what the compute reads, which is what lets
 * a name that appears later invalidate the index instead of being missed.
 *
 * Only the parent chain is scanned. A sub-agent that itself spawned a named
 * teammate has its `Agent` call inside the SUB-AGENT's transcript, and those are
 * the files that grow constantly — folding them in would trade this bound away
 * for 5 of 818 sub-agents. Such a teammate stays unreachable from a pane opened
 * by id, which is a state the result type can express; a nested card rendered
 * inside its parent's own pane still joins, because that surface holds the event
 * and passes the name directly.

 *
 * - `present`       — the file exists. `tail` may be `""`: the shell has
 *                     written nothing YET, which is not the same as the file
 *                     being gone. `truncated` = the file is longer than the
 *                     window, so `tail` starts at the first line boundary
 *                     inside it rather than at the file's start.
 * - `unknown-shell` — the conversation's transcript records no background
 *                     `Bash` launch with this id. The server resolves the
 *                     path itself from the transcript (the browser never sends
 *                     one), so this is the answer to a forged or stale id.
 * - `gone`          — the launch is recorded, but its file is not on disk any
 *                     more (a reboot, or tmp cleanup).

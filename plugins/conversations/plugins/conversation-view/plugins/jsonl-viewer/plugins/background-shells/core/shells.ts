 *   said so. `exitCode` is read from its summary's `(exit code N)` and is
 *   `null` when the summary does not state one.
 * - `killed` is also what a successful `TaskStop` of the shell says: Claude
 *   Code writes NO notification for a shell the agent stopped itself, so
 *   without it the shell would read `running` for as long as the conversation
 *   lives.
 * - `ended-unrecognized` — a notification arrived, so the shell is over, but
 *   with a `status` this build has never seen. Named rather than folded into
 *   `failed`: the transcript says it ended, and nothing says how.
 * - `ended-without-reporting` — no notification, and the conversation is no
 *   longer live. Claude Code kills its shells when it exits, so nothing is
 *   hosting it any more. The same parent-liveness evidence `subagentRunState`
 *   uses, and deliberately NO staleness timeout: a quiet shell may be one long
 *   `sleep`.

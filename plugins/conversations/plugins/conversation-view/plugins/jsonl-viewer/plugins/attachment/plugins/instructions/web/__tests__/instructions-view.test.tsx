/**
 * The instructions attachment arrives in two shapes, and the card must read
 * both. The launch snapshot lists the CLAUDE.md files the harness loaded; the
 * session-start re-read reports what CHANGED, and its `files` is legitimately
 * empty when the only news is that a file dropped out.
 *
 * The empty-`files` re-read is the regression this suite exists for: the card
 * used to throw on it and take the transcript row down with a crash boundary.
 * The payloads below are copied from real transcripts.

// The card's two chrome dependencies are stubbed, because both need the live
// app around them and neither is what is under test. `FilePath` reads the pane
// route (to open a file-peek pane) and throws outside a pane surface;
// `CollapsibleCard` renders the shared row-action strip, which reads the plugin
// registry. What IS under test is the reading the card takes of the payload —
// which counts it announces, which paths it lists, and whether it throws — so
// the stubs render exactly the pieces it hands them.

 * and this is its plural twin — same card, same `FilePath`, same capped
 * pre-wrapped body — so the two read as one family rather than as two
 * unrelated rows.
 *
 * The payload comes in two flavors, and the difference matters:
 *
 * - The **launch snapshot** carries `files` alone. It is the whole point of the
 *   row, so an empty one is a broken payload and throws.
 * - The **re-read report** (any of `reason` / `removed` / `changed`) is a
 *   delta: it says what the instruction set looks like now and which paths
 *   dropped out. `files` may legitimately be empty there — a re-read whose only
 *   news is a removal — so it renders the removals in the `−` grammar the other
 *   delta cards use, and a report with nothing in it says "No changes." rather
 *   than crashing the row.
 *
 * Collapsed by default: the content is long and standing, so the collapsed line
 * answers "which files, how many" and the body waits for a reader who asks.

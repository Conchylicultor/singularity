 * sub-agents, and opens its report pane.
 *
 * It is one of ours when a sub-agent of the conversation joins it: the
 * notification's tool-use id is that sub-agent's (its own, or the `Agent` call's
 * that launched it — a teammate's notification carries the call's), or its task
 * id is the sub-agent's own id. Anything else — a background shell's, say — is
 * declined, so it never opens a sub-agent pane that has nothing to show.
 *
 * The pane opens by the sub-agent's OWN id, the one key every sub-agent has.

    "The agent's work allowance as a transcript stat: how many tokens the harness has charged against it up to the reading position, summed across the re-anchor it performs on every new request. Reports the total spent rather than the number the harness prints, which is a padded per-request allowance handed to the model and so reads as a constant. Owns both halves of the move — the stat, and the filter that takes the harness's repeated reminder rows out of the transcript flow they were cluttering.",

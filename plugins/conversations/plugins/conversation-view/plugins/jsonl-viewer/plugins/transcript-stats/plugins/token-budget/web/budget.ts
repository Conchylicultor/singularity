/**
 * The harness injects a `total_tokens_reminder` attachment repeatedly through a
 * session, each carrying one number wrapped in prose:
 * `<total_tokens>15000000 tokens left</total_tokens>`.
 *
 * That number is a **work allowance handed to the agent**, not a measurement of
 * the conversation: the harness writes it into the model's own prompt so the
 * model can judge how much room it has, re-anchors it to the full value at the
 * start of every user request, and pads it far above what any real request
 * spends. Read as "left" it is therefore a constant — the readings sit within a
 * fraction of a percent of the ceiling, and every new request puts them back on
 * it.
 *
 * What the series does carry is the harness's own charge accounting, which
 * counts work no other row in the transcript can account for (a subagent's or a
 * workflow's output is charged here but recorded in its own transcript). So
 * this folds the whole series into the one reading that moves: the total
 * charged, summed across the re-anchors.
 *
 * As transcript ROWS the reminders are pure noise — dozens of near-identical
 * lines whose number barely moves — so the plugin hides them too.

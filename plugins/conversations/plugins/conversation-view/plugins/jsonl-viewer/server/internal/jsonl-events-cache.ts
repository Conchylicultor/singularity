// ONE module-level memo, shared between the resource (jsonl-events-resource.ts —
// BOTH its `revalidate` and its `loader`) and the transcript watcher (the
// authoritative READER of the session chain, which primes through `watchTranscript`).
//
// The signature is the CHAIN signature (transcript-watcher's
// `transcriptChainSignature`): `chainLength` plus a per-file (path, lstat mtime+size)
// triple. It is a faithful function of every input `readJsonlEventsFromChain` reads —
// an append moves a file's (mtimeMs, size), a session switch grows `chainLength` and
// adds a triple, a vanishing file drops a triple while `chainLength` stands.
//
// Before this, `revalidate` `lstat`ed the chain itself (instantly fresh) while the
// loader returned a module-level `cachedEvents` map written by the watcher's callback
// (fresh only AFTER the watcher fired). A read landing between a transcript append and
// that callback shipped a stale value stamped with an already-current ETag — the exact
// edited-files defect. It was non-fatal ONLY because this resource is `mode: "push"`:
// its frames carry the value, so a skewed sub-ack is superseded by the next push. The
// resource's soundness rested entirely on a mode choice recorded nowhere near it, and
// switching to `invalidate` (a few bytes per frame instead of the whole event array)
// would have silently reintroduced a permanent stale pin.
//
// `createSignedMemo` binds signature and compute at construction: `memo.signature`
// feeds `revalidate`, `memo.get` feeds the `loader`, and they cannot drift because
// there is nothing to pass. The mode is now a delivery choice, irrelevant to
// correctness.
//
// Both halves resolve the chain first. A session switch landing between the memo's
// own signature probe and its own compute leaves the stored signature describing the
// OLDER chain — the safe direction: the next `get` re-probes, misses, and recomputes,
// costing one needless read. The dangerous direction (a signature newer than the value
// it labels, which every subsequent `get` would hit and serve forever) is unreachable,
// because the probe always precedes the compute it labels.
//

 * Write-through prime from the transcript watcher (the authoritative reader): store
 * the freshly merged event list under the signature the watcher captured BEFORE
 * reading the chain, so the `notify` that follows finds a pure cache hit rather than
 * re-reading and re-parsing the whole chain on the push path.
 *
 * The signature-before-read ordering is the memo's `prime` contract, and the watcher
 * upholds it by fanning out `{ events, signature }` as one inseparable pair: an append
 * landing mid-read leaves the stored signature older than the value, so the next `get`
 * re-probes, misses, and recomputes. Over-invalidates; never serves a torn value under
 * a matching signature.
 *
 * The prime only ever hits if the watcher's signature and the resource's probe produce
 * byte-identical strings — which is why both route through `transcriptChainSignature`
 * rather than agreeing by coincidence of two stat APIs' float precision.

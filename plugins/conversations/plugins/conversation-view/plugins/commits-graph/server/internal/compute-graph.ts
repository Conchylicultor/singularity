// ── graph: bespoke split-signature two-half cache (Stage 2) ─────────────────

// `main`-advance (changes behind only; HEAD & merge-base unchanged) reuses the
// expensive pending half. Its two-half structure is genuinely special, so it
// does NOT use the generic single-signature memo; it keeps its own bespoke
// cache + worktree-keyed single-flight.
//
// Keys (each a faithful function of the inputs that half reads):
//   pending : `${headSha}|${mergeBase}`          → { commits, ahead, branch }
//   behind  : `${mainSha}|${mergeBase}`          → { behindCommits, behind }
//   landed  : `${headSha}|${mergeBase}|${landedShasKey}` → { landedCommits }
// landedCommits = the landedShas log filtered to exclude the pending set, so it
// must refresh whenever EITHER the pending set (headSha+mergeBase) OR the landed
// set moves. The landed set is now git-measured (attempt-work greps `main`'s
// Singularity-Conversation trailers) rather than read off the `pushes` ledger, so
// it is keyed by the shas themselves and cannot lag behind a stalled ingest job.

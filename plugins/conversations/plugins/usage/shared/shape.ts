/**
 * One conversation's usage totals — the conversation's own transcripts (every
 * session of its anchored chain) plus every sub-agent's, workflow agents
 * included. Stored in the `conversations_ext_usage` extension table
 * (`server/internal/tables.ts`), recomputed from the per-file scan state by
 * `syncConversationUsage`.
 *
 * - `costUsd` — priced with stats/cost's own price table (`priceBucket`).
 * - `tokens` — input + output + cache creation. Cache READS are kept apart
 *   (`cacheReadTokens`): they dwarf the rest and mostly measure context × turns.
 * - `agentCount` — the sub-agents the conversation launched.
 *
 * Token counts are floats (double precision), not ints: a long workflow's cache
 * reads pass the 32-bit integer range.

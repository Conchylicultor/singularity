// Claude Code deletes session JSONL transcripts whose mtime is older than
// `cleanupPeriodDays` (default 30). Singularity reads those files directly as
// the SOLE source of truth for conversation content — it never copies them
// into Postgres — so an active-but-idle conversation would silently lose its
// transcript once 30 idle days pass. Touching every retained conversation's
// JSONL daily keeps its mtime fresh, well inside the window, and keeps
// `claude --resume` working (resume reads the same file).
//
// "Retained" = active, PLUS every conversation of a HELD task whatever its own
// status. Holding is the user parking work they mean to resume, and the "Hold &
// close" flow closes the conversations on the way out — so scoping to `active`
// would age out exactly the history a hold was meant to preserve. Closed
// conversations of non-held tasks are still left to age out, so this stays
// selective and never bloats disk.
//
// EVERY file of the conversation's session chain is touched, not just the live
// tail: the read path merges the whole chain, so an ancestor Claude GC'd would
// erase the history it contributes.

/**
 * The All-conversations pane is a LIVE window over `conversations` joined to
 * its attempt and task (`conversations.all`, P7 of
 * research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md) — no revision
 * tick, no HTTP refetch, no reload:
 *
 *  1. seeds a task, its attempt, a `user` and a `system` conversation (inert:
 *     closed, the task's title not machine-made); the user one is listed, the
 *     system one is not (the `unless: kind` default);
 *  2. a poller write (`waiting_for`, `last_viewed_at`) sends the list NOTHING
 *     (outside the route gate);
 *  3. the task is renamed through the REAL rename endpoint: the row's Task
 *     column relabels, live (the `tasks` reverse route);
 *  4. the conversation is retitled in the database: the row relabels, live;
 *  5. the task is deleted: its conversation leaves the list (the cascade);
 *  6. no HTTP read of `conversations.all` after the first listing — rows arrive
 *     only over the socket — and the page never reloaded.
 *
 * Seeds go straight into the deploy's database (out of band, so anything on
 * screen came off the server) and are deleted at the end (also on failure).
 * Refuses main.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.
 *   ./singularity run plugins/conversations/plugins/all-conversations/e2e/list-live-verify.ts [--headed]

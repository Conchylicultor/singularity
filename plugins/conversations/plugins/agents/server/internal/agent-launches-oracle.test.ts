/**
 * `agent-launches` as an `all` collection (P8 v3 step 21), on the TREE ORACLE
 * (tasks-core's `server/testing`): the real declaration compiled with the real
 * serve options against a throwaway database, through the real feed, with the
 * REAL `task_latest_conversation` rollup installed beside tasks-core's own
 * (its two sources: `conversations` through the `attempts` hop, and
 * `attempts` carrying `task_id`), and L2 on — so the set is a persisted alias,
 * as it ships (`preload: "boot"`).
 *
 * The tree workload runs with launch writes and a few conversation / attempt
 * writes spliced in. After every step:
 *
 * - the rollup equals its aggregate recomputed from scratch (its own drift
 *   scan finds no key) — W8 against the shipped declaration: an attempt
 *   deleted (its conversations cascade, and their DELETE resolves no task
 *   through the hop) or moved between tasks re-aggregates both tasks;
 * - the subscribed `{}` view, the `:rows` point view (over L1, L2) and the
 *   kept `{}` snapshot equal a fresh FULL load;
 * - both readers' costs are exact: a launch insert is an entrant (one refill,
 *   one `orderOf`), its delete an exit with no load; a conversation write
 *   the rollup reads (insert, status, title) refills the launches of its task;
 *   an attempt insert, move or delete the launches of its task(s) (the
 *   attempts source's route); a write nothing reads (the poller's
 *   `waiting_for` / `last_viewed_at`, a push, a task or edge write) nothing;
 * - nothing is ever loaded FULL after the subscribe (W1/W2 for this key).
 *
 * Then the C39 old-bundle check against the real key, with a literal frozen
 * copy of the legacy row.
 *
 * Requires a running Postgres cluster (started by ./singularity build).
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/conversations/plugins/agents`.

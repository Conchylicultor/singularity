 *
 * It used to be stated twice, the second time as a tmux `-f` filter written
 * `#{r:…}` — not a tmux modifier, and it kept every pane, so the sweep adopted
 * every session on the host whose start path was a worktree
 * (research/2026-10-07-conversations-status-shadow-audit-retirement.md).
 *
 * Derived from the conversation id KIND's namespace (`conv-`, plus its legacy
 * `claude-` alias), not re-typed: a prefix test, deliberately looser than the
 * kind's full shape, so a session is never dropped for a body the shape test
 * would quibble with.

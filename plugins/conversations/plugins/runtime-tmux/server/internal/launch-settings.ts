// The one `--settings` object a launch hands Claude Code. Two contributors share
// it: the thinking mode (`{"ultracode":true}`, from effort-provider) and the
// hooks below. One object, one flag — two `--settings` flags would leave which
// one wins to the CLI.
//
// The hooks are the question's push signal. Nothing on disk says an
// AskUserQuestion menu is up: the CLI buffers the assistant message and writes
// its tool_use only once the tool resolves, and the sessions file reads as an
// ordinary wait (or `busy`, depending on the version). So the agent itself
// touches the conversation's signal file the moment the tool starts
// (`PreToolUse`, before the menu is drawn) and again when it resolves either way
// (`PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure`) or a prompt is submitted
// (`UserPromptSubmit`). The touch only wakes the reconciler; the pane itself
// (pane-menu.ts) still decides whether a menu is on screen.
//
// The question relay (conversations/question-relay) rides the same PreToolUse
// matcher: it HOLDS the call while the web shows the question and answers it
// through `updatedInput`, so the menu is drawn only when the relay lets go.
// Hooks on one matcher run in parallel, so the touch still wakes the reconciler
// at once. A `Notification` touch wakes it when the CLI draws a menu after all
// (a released question) — the one moment nothing else signals.

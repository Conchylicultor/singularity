 *   2. `local` — the record cannot say so (no stamp at all), is not a background
 *      host, and runs in this pane's worktree.
 *
 * Tier 2 is not a convenience. A daemon-hosted process does not inherit
 * `$TMUX_PANE`, so a relocated session cannot stamp itself — and a stamp-only
 * rule would stop following relocations, which is exactly the failure that
 * froze a transcript for 747 minutes in July 2026 and again for 10h25m on
 * 2026-08-18. A stranger's messages showing up is visible and was caught in a
 * day; a silently frozen transcript is not. Tier 2 keeps the relocation case
 * resolvable while `kind !== "bg"` + `cwd` keep the lent spare out: the spare is
 * a background host running in someone else's worktree, so it fails both.
 *
 * Background sessions stay reachable through the explicit `parkedJobId` →
 * `jobId` pointer, which is authoritative. That is what lets tier 2 exclude
 * `kind: "bg"` outright without losing the parked case.

// Drives a ConversationRow through the three things the row owns: it opens the
// run in a column beside the surface, it marks itself as the one open, and a
// second click closes that column again.
//
// The surface it drives is the task detail's Attempts card — the case the two
// hand-rolled active-state heuristics used to get WRONG. Reached from the task
// list, its route holds no conversation pane of its own, so the old
// "last entry, but only if there are two" rule answered "nothing is open" and
// the row never lit up.
//
// A task must be named, because only a task that has been worked has runs to
// show and nothing in the app names one generically. Find one with:
//   SELECT a.task_id FROM attempts a JOIN conversations c ON c.attempt_id = a.id
//   GROUP BY a.task_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
//
// Usage:
//   ./singularity run plugins/conversations/plugins/conversation-ui/plugins/row/e2e/conversation-row-verify.ts --task <taskId>

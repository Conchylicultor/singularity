/**
 * The sidebar History list is a LIVE source of the merged
 * `conversations-sidebar` DataView (`conversations.history`, P7 of
 * research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md) — the first
 * merged surface with a live origin:
 *
 *  1. seeds a task, its attempt, a `user` and a `system` conversation (inert:
 *     closed, the task's title not machine-made) and opens the sidebar on the
 *     History view: BOTH are listed (History has no default scope);
 *  2. the system conversation's status flips (done → gone → done) in the
 *     database: History receives it, live — the revision tick it replaced
 *     hashed non-system rows only and never did;
 *  3. the task is renamed through the REAL rename endpoint: History receives
 *     the new task title for its rows, live (the `tasks` reverse route);
 *  4. a poller write sends History nothing;
 *  5. the task is deleted: both rows leave (the cascade);
 *  6. no HTTP read of `conversations.history` after the first listing — rows arrive
 *     only over the socket — and the page never reloaded.
 *
 * A row is named per the user's "Conversation list title" setting, so the
 * on-screen checks accept the conversation's title or its task's.
 *
 * Seeds go straight into the deploy's database and are deleted at the end
 * (also on failure). Refuses main.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

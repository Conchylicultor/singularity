/**
 * The conversation sidebar as ONE merged DataView surface: view-instances bind
 * to the contributed sources (Queue, History) via the config rows' `source`
 * key, under a single unified switcher.
 *
 * A hairline sets the list apart from the nav rows above it, so the view
 * switcher below reads as its own control rather than as one more nav link.
 * The rule sits OUTSIDE the scroller: it divides the sidebar, it is not part
 * of the list, so it stays put while the list scrolls under the switcher.
 *
 * `<Scroll axis="y" fill>` is the ONE scroll ancestor. The mount point is a
 * `Shell.Sidebar` fill contribution (a flex column cell), the DataView never
 * owns a scroller, and the sticky toolbar / live-scroll sentinel / row
 * virtualization all bind to this single scroll viewport.
 *
 * The chrome is the sidebar's own ({@link SIDEBAR_TOOLBAR}): one sticky line
 * holding the view switcher as a full-width row and the options trigger. The
 * group headers are `"quiet"` — "Queue 6", with the fold chevron on hover — so
 * they read as captions over the rows rather than as a second band of chrome.

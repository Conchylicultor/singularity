// The identity of a conversation's session chain — the single definition of "did
// the chain change?", owned by the plugin that owns the chain.
//
// Two consumers share it, and they MUST agree byte-for-byte: the watcher captures
// it before each read (and primes a signed memo with it), and `jsonl-events`'
// `revalidate` probes it on the read path. A conservative over-approximation — it
// changes whenever the chain's parsed VALUE could change (serving stale is a
// correctness bug; a needless recompute is merely a missed optimization).
//
// The value is the MERGE of a conversation's whole session chain, so the signature
// must cover every file in it. Each file contributes a (path, mtimeMs, size)
// triple: an append changes both mtime and size, and folding in the resolved path
// means a session whose transcript path changes never matches a prior file's
// signature. It fingerprints the FILES — the source of truth — not any in-memory
// cache (which is empty after a restart, exactly when this matters).
//
// `lstat`, never `Bun.file().lastModified`: the latter is integer-ms, the former a
// sub-ms float, so the two produce different strings for the same file. Routing
// every producer through `statChain` is what makes the watcher's primed signature
// match the resource's probe. Split them and every prime silently misses, degrading
// the memo to a full chain re-read on every push. One stat API, one authority.

 *   - an append to any file     → that file's (mtimeMs, size) changes;
 *   - a NEW chain entry         → `chainLength` grows and a new triple appears;
 *   - a file vanishing under us → its triple disappears while `chainLength` stands.
 *
 * An empty chain is `"none"`, which never matches a real signature, so it degrades

/**
 * File a `conversation-foreign-session` report, debounced per
 * `(conversationId, foreignSessionId)`.
 *
 * The debounce is not cosmetic rate-limiting: the caller is
 * `resolveConversationTranscriptPaths`, which runs on every transcript read and
 * on every live push of an active conversation — several times a second while an
 * agent is talking — and a corrupt chain stays corrupt, so the condition is
 * persistent. `recordReport` is a DB upsert; without a gate in FRONT of it a
 * single corrupted chain would put the report engine on the hot read path.
 *
 * `recordReportDebounced` never throws into the caller and never hands it a
 * promise to wait on: a report that cannot be written must not be able to break
 * reading a conversation.

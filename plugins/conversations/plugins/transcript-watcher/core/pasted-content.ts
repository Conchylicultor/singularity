/**
 * Undoing Claude Code's `<pasted_content>` wrapper, so a transcript row reads
 * as the message the person actually wrote.
 *
 * The CLI files anything it classifies as a paste under tags, and writes the
 * wrapped form into the session log:
 *
 *   \n\n<pasted_content id="e112">\nAnswering your questions:\n…\n</pasted_content id="e112">\n
 *
 * Every consumer downstream wants the text inside. The conversation view would
 * otherwise show the tags to the reader; the pending-turn check looks for the
 * text it sent and would never find it, so a delivered message shows "Not
 * confirmed" with a Retry that sends it twice; and the rewind pairing compares
 * a user turn against the queue row that carried it, where the queue stores the
 * raw draft and only the turn is wrapped.
 *
 * The app no longer produces these itself — it types turns instead of pasting
 * them (see runtime-tmux's typed-keys.ts) — but they arrive anyway: from every
 * transcript written before that, and whenever the person pastes into the
 * terminal by hand.
 *
 * The grammar is the CLI's own, read off its parser rather than guessed: the id
 * is exactly four lowercase-hex characters, the opening tag is followed
 * immediately by a newline, and the closing tag REPEATS the id
 * (`</pasted_content id="e112">`, which is not valid XML). Anything that does
 * not match exactly is left alone — prose that merely mentions the tag keeps
 * its text.

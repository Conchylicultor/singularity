/**
 * What to do with a DB row whose live process is missing.
 * - `"hibernate"`: resumable row not yet hibernated → stamp `hibernatedAt`.
 * - `"leave-hibernated"`: resumable row already hibernated → leave alone.
 * - `"leave-unowned"`: not this runtime's row to classify (non-main) → no write.
 * - `"gone"`: nothing to resume (no `claudeSessionId`) → mark disconnected.
 *
 * A MISSING PROCESS NEVER CHANGES STATUS. tmux presence is an internal resource
 * detail: panes are idle-killed to reclaim resources and transparently respawned
 * by `ensureResumed` when the user opens the conversation. A `waiting` row stays
 * `waiting` and a `working` row stays `working` when its pane disappears — only
 * an explicit close (`exit_clean` / the UI's Exit, via `closeRequested` →
 * `markConversationClosed`) moves a conversation to a terminal status.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND THE UI — writing `gone` from process absence deleted
 * users' work. `gone` is simultaneously:
 *   - the RESUMABLE state: `resumeConversation` refuses any row that is not
 *     `gone`/`done`, so `gone` is what makes a conversation resumable; and
 *   - the NOT-LIVE state: `has_live_conv = status NOT IN ('gone','done')` feeds
 *     `attempts_v.active`, which is the worktree reaper's `if (attempt.active)
 *     return null` guard.
 * So the moment a vanished pane wrote `gone`, the conversation was marked
 * resumable and its git worktree became collectable in the same write. A reboot
 * or `tmux kill-server` while an agent was mid-turn was enough to get a live
 * conversation's checkout reaped out from under it.
 *
 * The old shape had this inverted: hibernation was a narrow exception
 * (`onMain && hibernationEnabled && status === "waiting" && claudeSessionId`)
 * and EVERYTHING else fell through to `gone`. Now hibernation is the rule and
 * `gone` is the narrow exception.
 *
 * Note the signature cannot read `status` at all. That is deliberate: the
 * invariant "process absence does not depend on, or alter, conversation status"
 * is enforced by the type rather than by discipline.
 *
 * Eligibility is deliberately SEPARATE from the re-stamp guard (`hibernatedAt`).
 * An already-hibernated row stays eligible and must be left untouched — its
 * process is intentionally absent forever, so folding `!hibernatedAt` into
 * eligibility would flip every hibernated conversation on the next ~1s tick.

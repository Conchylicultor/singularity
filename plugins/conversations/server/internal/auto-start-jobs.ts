// The transactional heart of an auto-launch: claim the marker and commit the
// launch on ONE transaction. Returns whether this call launched.
//
// THE RULE: the marker and the launch commit together. A throw, a crash or a
// killed connection anywhere in here rolls the whole thing back — the marker is
// still there, and there is no attempt, no conversation and no fork/spawn job —
// so the job's own retry, or the boot reconcile, launches the task again.
// Nothing is ever left stranded with its marker consumed and no launch.
//
// And never twice: the claim is a `DELETE … RETURNING` on the marker row, which
// row-locks it. A concurrent runner's claim blocks on that lock until this
// transaction ends, then finds the row gone (we committed: it returns false) or
// claims it itself (we rolled back). Exactly one launch commits.
//
// `tx` must be a status batch's executor (`withTaskStatusBatch` /
// `runStatusBatchOn`) — the launch's status-changing writes assert it.
//
// `ifAlreadyStarted` says what an existing attempt on the task means, and the
// caller must say it because the two callers mean opposite things. For the
// queue (`skip`) an attempt is a manual start that raced in — the task has its
// launch, starting it again would double it. For an explicit user launch
// (`launch`) the user is asking for ANOTHER run of a task that already has one
// (a second "Fix this crash" on the same report reuses the report's task), so
// an attempt is no reason to refuse. The claim stays the exactly-once gate in
// both modes: it is what stops two runners launching one ARM.

// Static trigger target: fires on every taskStatusChanged and re-checks the
// auto-start eligibility of the task whose status changed. That is the whole
// rule now — there is no fan-out to dependents any more.
//
// Why one task is enough. `tasks.statusChanged` used to be emitted only for the
// task ids a call site remembered to name, so it fired for the endpoint of an
// edge write and never for the downstream tasks whose derived status that write
// had just changed. It is now emitted for `{T} ∪ transitiveDependents(T)`,
// derived from the graph inside the write itself
// (tasks-core `withTaskStatusChange`). So a task that becomes launchable
// because something upstream moved gets its OWN event.
//
// And for an armed, attempt-less, undropped, unheld task, `blocked` is exactly
// the status it carries while it is not launchable. So "becomes launchable" and
// "leaves blocked" are the same event once the event is closure-correct — which
// is why the old two-case shape is gone: the armed-dependents fan-out has
// nothing left to find, and the `previousStatus === "blocked"` condition on the
// direct case would only re-exclude the un-dropped / un-held task it was meant
// to catch.
//
// The fan-out was not merely redundant — it was UNABLE to cover the case that
// motivated this: it walked `task_dependencies` for armed dependents of the
// settled task, and when the unblocking write was an edge REMOVAL, the walk ran
// over an edge that no longer existed and reached nobody.
//
// The armed-marker guard below is what keeps the now-wider event stream from
// amplifying into launch jobs: a settle on a task with 47 dependents emits up
// to 48 events, and all but the armed ones stop here on one indexed read.
// maybeLaunchTaskJob remains the exactly-once gate (dropped/held? armed?
// unblocked? unclaimed? no existing attempt?), so waking it for a task that
// turns out to be ineligible is a safe no-op.
//
// A consequence worth naming: this rule keys on NO status at all, so a new
// status is not something it has to be taught. `in_progress_blocked` arrived
// while this change was in flight and needed an `isBlockedStatus` predicate in
// the old `previousStatus === "blocked"` condition; here it needs nothing —
// maybeLaunchTaskJob asks `hasBlockingDep` directly rather than reading a
// status, so the gate cannot fall out of step with the status vocabulary.
//
// This intermediary job cannot be collapsed into maybeLaunchTaskJob itself: a
// Trigger's `with` is a static input, and `taskId` arrives on the separate
// `event` argument, so the launch job cannot bind to the event directly.

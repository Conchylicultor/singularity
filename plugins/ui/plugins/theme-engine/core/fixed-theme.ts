/**
 * A fixed theme: a whole theme that one region of the screen always wears,
 * whatever theme its scope selects — the app chrome's neutral graphite, which
 * stays the same while the focused app changes underneath it.
 *
 * It sits between a `Theme` and a `SubTheme`:
 *  - Like a theme, it is resolved over EVERY token group's schema defaults, so
 *    a token it does not name reads the default, never the surrounding app's
 *    value. Nothing leaks in from the app it hosts.
 *  - Like a sub-theme, it is never selected for a scope: a region opts in with
 *    `<Theme name={fixedThemeScope(fixedTheme)}>`, and the theme picker never
 *    lists it.
 *  - Popups opened from inside wear it too (the portal forward is not
 *    region-only): a menu opened from the chrome is more of the chrome.
 *
 * It paints ONE color scheme in both modes. A fixed theme is constant, so the
 * light/dark switch does not change it: `scheme: "dark"` paints the dark half of
 * the resolution — its fragments' `dark` values over the groups' `darkDefault`s
 * — under both the light and the dark selector. Write fragments with `both(…)`
 * so the two halves cannot disagree about what the theme means.
 *
 * Tailwind's `dark:` variants still follow the page's global light/dark class
 * (per-scope color mode is deferred), so inside a dark fixed theme on a light
 * page those variants stay off; everything painted from tokens is correct.

 * A sub-theme: a few token values that one region of the screen wears ON TOP of
 * the theme around it — the website's page type scale over the site's palette.
 *
 * Unlike a `Theme`, it is never selected for a scope and is never
 * resolved against schema defaults. A region opts in with
 * `<Theme name={subThemeScope(subTheme)}>`, and every token the sub-theme does
 * not name keeps whatever the surrounding theme paints, by plain CSS
 * inheritance. So a sub-theme that only sets sizes follows the app's palette
 * wherever it goes, including after the app's theme is switched.
 *
 * Its values are painted as written: the surrounding theme's color adjustment
 * does not apply to them.

 *
 * Why the extra tokens: a custom property's `var()` is substituted where the
 * property is declared, and descendants inherit the result. The surrounding
 * theme declares a derived token at its own scope, so it arrives in the region
 * already computed from the surrounding base — re-valuing only the base would
 * reach nothing derived from it (the website header kept the app's 12px pane
 * inset under a sub-theme that set the gutter). Re-declaring the derived token
 * inside the region recomputes it there. So inside a sub-theme a group's
 * derivations follow the sub-theme's values, even where the surrounding theme
 * had given the derived token a value of its own; to keep a different one, the
 * sub-theme names it.
 *
 * Within one group only: a derivation that crosses groups is not re-declared.

/**
 * The quick-switch panel body: contributed quick sections on top (the theme
 * picker, then the light/dark switch — this file names neither, and their
 * order is reorder config's), every component variant picker below, and a footer
 * that hands off to the full customizer pane.
 *
 * It is a CONTROL PANEL body and therefore paints nothing of its own — no
 * padding, no scroll region, no bordered footer band. The `ControlPanelPopover`
 * that opens it owns the surface (and the scrolling), and the panel draws the
 * hairline above each band, which is why the footer here is a `Footer` rather
 * than an `Inset` with a `border-t`. Its action takes a leading `icon`, like
 * every footer in the vocabulary (invariant #4) — and this is the one panel
 * where that is visible: a footer row is still a row, so the ⚙ down here opens
 * the icon column and the variant rows above indent their labels 26px. The
 * alternative was three different treatments of one footer glyph across the
 * app, and uniformity won that trade.
 *
 * Scope resolution mirrors the customizer pane exactly — edits target the active
 * app's own theme once that app has been forked ("Customize for <App>" in the
 * pane), and base otherwise — so switching a theme from here and from the pane
 * write the same place. Forking itself stays a pane concern; this surface only
 * follows the choice already made there.

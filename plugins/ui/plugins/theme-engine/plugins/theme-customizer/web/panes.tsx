/**
 * The customizer opens inside whichever app you are currently in — it styles
 * that app's theme scope — so callers compose
 * `activeApp.path + themeCustomizerRoute.path({})` rather than one fixed link.
 * Keeping the segment here rather than inline at call sites means a rename
 * still propagates to every link.
 *
 * Being openable anywhere is NOT the same as having no home: Appearance is a
 * Settings surface, so `app` is `settingsApp` and Expand takes the customizer
 * to Settings, where it lives on its own. The in-place, restyle-what-you-see
 * usage is the popover/side-pane one, which Expand does not disturb.

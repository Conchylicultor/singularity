 * Dimmed-leaf disclosure — the merged box, with a childless row's icon

 *
 * Keeps the merged variant's compactness (no extra column) and needs no hover,
 * but pays for it: the signal is a relative one (you read it by comparing rows,
 * not by looking at one), and it borrows the muted/disabled channel to mean
 * "leaf", which is not a lesser state.

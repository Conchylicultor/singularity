 * Merged disclosure (Notion style) — the identity icon and the chevron share
 * one size-5 box: icon at rest, chevron on row hover. Mirrors tree's inline
 * `DefaultMergedDisclosure` byte-for-byte, so loading this plugin changes
 * nothing until another variant is picked.
 *
 * Only a row with children swaps its icon for the chevron: a leaf keeps its
 * icon under the cursor, so hovering is how you tell parents from leaves. The
 * trade-off this variant accepts is that structure is invisible at rest.

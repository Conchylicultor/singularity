    "Viewport-escape report kind: validates the viewport-overlay auditor's fault payloads (viewport-containing-block = an ancestor's transform/filter/contain made itself the frame of reference, so the box is clipped instead of full-viewport; viewport-stacking-context = an ancestor opened a stacking context, so the box's z-index is compared in the wrong bracket and it stops covering the chrome beside it), fingerprints by fault + subject + blocking element (excluding the message, whose quoted computed value changes every scroll), and renders a per-fault task naming the declaration to remove, scope or make conditional. Re-arms periodically (6h) since the offending declaration reproduces the fault on every activation.",

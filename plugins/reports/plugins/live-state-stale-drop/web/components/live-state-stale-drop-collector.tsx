// A Core.Root side-effect component. `live-state` is a primitive and must not
// import `reports`, so `fetchOverHttp` emits a neutral HttpStaleDropReport into a
// module-level sink on EVERY dropped body (policy-free, carrying a running
// consecutive-drop count); this component owns the mapping from that body to a
// `kind: "live-state-stale-drop"` report — exactly the inversion crash uses for
// error-boundary's boundaryReportSink. Renders nothing.
//
// THE THRESHOLD LIVES HERE. We file a report only on the exact instant the third
// consecutive drop lands while the query still holds only its placeholder
// (`consecutiveDrops === 3 && neverApplied`). Exact-equals — not `>=` — so one
// wedge episode files exactly one report; the primitive's per-key counter resets
// to zero on any successful apply, which re-arms this for the next genuine wedge.

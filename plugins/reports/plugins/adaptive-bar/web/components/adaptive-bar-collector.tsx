// A Core.Root side-effect component. The adaptive-bar primitive is a primitive
// and must not import `reports`, so it emits a neutral `AdaptiveBarFault` into a
// module-level sink; this component owns the mapping from that body to a
// `kind: "adaptive-bar"` report — exactly the inversion crash uses for
// error-boundary's boundaryReportSink. Renders nothing.
//
// Until this existed the sink had NO consumer, and `defineReportSink` is a
// silent no-op until something registers: every adaptive-bar layout fault in
// production was dropped on the floor, while the primitive's own docs promised a
// filed report. That is how a fit-vs-layout disagreement was able to take the
// whole Debug → Layout Lab pane down without a single row appearing anywhere.
//
// NO THRESHOLD HERE, deliberately. The primitive already refuses to report the
// normal case at the source: running out of room and relocating widgets is what
// the bar is FOR and never reaches the sink. Every body that arrives is a broken
// premise — one report each, deduped server-side by (fault, origin, overflow).

      // comment). This mapping is the one place that imports both, so a fault
      // kind, an overflow mode or an evidence field that is added, renamed,
      // retyped or removed on the primitive fails to typecheck HERE rather than
      // 400-ing at ingest. (One direction only: a field ADDED to

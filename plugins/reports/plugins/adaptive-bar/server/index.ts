    "Adaptive-bar report kind: validates the adaptive-bar primitive's layout-contract fault payloads (no-slack = the bar was given no room to give, row-overflow = on a converged pass the fit blessed the row as fitting and the occupants still stick out of the bar's own content box, no-convergence = the placement never settled, iframe-relocation = a frame the browser cannot move without reloading), fingerprints by fault + origin (the innermost UI-context node above the bar's root, falling back to the label that several unrelated bars share) + overflow mode, excluding the per-occurrence lineage path, round evidence and message so one broken bar = one row, and renders a per-fault task — what the bar did instead, the consumer-side fix, and for no-convergence the recorded rounds naming which occupant resized itself. Re-arms periodically (6h) since a broken host re-produces the fault on every mount.",

// The collector is the ONE mapping from the editor's neutral sink body to a
// `page-undo-conflict` report. Two things are load-bearing: the mapping itself
// (kind, source, a message that reads plainly, the body carried as `data`) and
// the lifetime — a mounted collector drains the sink, an unmounted one leaves
// it inert, so a body emitted after unmount reaches nothing.

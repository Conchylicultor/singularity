// base `where` — a worktree's `reports` holds only its own rows (the table is
// excluded from the fork).
//
// Its changes arrive from the reports producer (./producer), never from a
// trigger: the routes this compiles are identity routes over `reports.id`, which
// carry no column, so the ids a producer emits are all they need (A3p).

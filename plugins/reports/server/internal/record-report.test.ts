/**
 * Suite for shed-replay timestamp honesty (Stage 4 of
 * research/2026-07-11-global-observability-freeze-blind-spots.md): a report
 * buffered during a duress episode replays with its true in-freeze
 * `occurredAt`, and an out-of-order replay can never move last_seen_at
 * backwards (or first_seen_at forwards) nor clobber fresher last-writer-wins
 * attribution. Those semantics live in the ON CONFLICT SQL, so this drives the
 * executor-parametrized writeReport against a throwaway Postgres
 * (db-test-fixture) seeded with the REAL migration chain.
 *
 * writeReport writes through the reports change producer, mounted here with
 * `mountProducersForTest` and its routes captured: every write routes exactly
 * the id its statement returned — the rate-limited path included (its bell is
 * skipped; its row's change is not).
 *
 * Run: `bun test plugins/reports/server/internal`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

// The `reports` table's change source. It carries no change-feed trigger: every
// write is made by this backend (`recordReport`, `investigateReport`, the noise
// backfill, the retention sweep — an exec child files through the outbox), and
// a crash storm UPDATEs one hot row thousands of times a minute, which a
// per-statement trigger + changelog row + NOTIFY would amplify during exactly
// the incidents the table records. So every write goes through
// `reportsProducer.mutate`, which routes the ids the statement returned straight
// into the live-state cascade, coalesced to one flush per 2 s window.
//
// Volatile: a change still pending when the backend restarts is lost, and an
// open reader reloads in full on resubscribe. Hence no reader of `reports` may
// be L2-persisted (A6, live-state-snapshot) — `reports.list` is a window, which
// never is.

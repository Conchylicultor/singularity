// own state is unrecoverable and calls `process.exit(1)` has exactly as little
// event loop left as one that crashed. So the buffered line carries an optional
// `kind` + `data`, which is what lets `reportServerFatalSync` file a TYPED
// report on the way out instead of an anonymous crash. Lines written without
// them (every `appendReportSync` caller, and every line left by an older
// backend) read back as the `crash` kind, so nothing about the existing path

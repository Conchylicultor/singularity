/**
 * The whole options-resolving control, as ONE element handed to the panel's
 * value cell.
 *
 * It is a COMPONENT rather than part of the field's `useShape`, and that is
 * structural rather than stylistic. The options come from a contributed HOOK
 * (`match.useOptions`), and whether there is a match is only known at render —
 * so calling it from `useShape` would be a conditional hook call in one
 * component instance, which React rejects the moment a contribution appears or
 * disappears under a mounted field. Splitting the two arms into two component
 * TYPES is what makes the transition a remount instead of a hook-order
 * violation, and that split is preserved verbatim from the renderer this
 * replaced.
 *
 * The consequence is that a dynamic enum is always the picker form, never a band
 * of radio rows: its option count is not known until after the shape has been
 * declared, and the shape is what the panel's threshold reads. A dynamic enum's
 * option set is a live catalogue (theme presets, the user's own categories),
 * which is the long half of that threshold anyway.

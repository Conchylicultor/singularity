/**
 * `exitWithParent`'s worker-thread body: blocks until the parent's lifeline
 * lock is free, then SIGKILLs this whole process.
 *
 * The parent holds `flock(LOCK_EX)` on the lifeline file for exactly as long as
 * it is alive and waiting on us. The kernel drops that lock when the parent's
 * fd closes — which includes the parent dying by SIGKILL, OOM or a crash, when
 * no cleanup code of its own runs. So our `flock(LOCK_SH)` is granted at the
 * instant the parent is gone, and not before.
 *
 * Why the kill happens HERE and not via a message to the main thread: the
 * process this guards (the type-check worker) spends minutes in one synchronous
 * TypeScript program build. Its main thread would never drain a message, so the
 * orphan would run to completion — which is the bug. `process.kill` is a plain
 * syscall, legal from any thread, whatever the main thread is doing.
 *
 * A missing lifeline file means the same thing as a granted lock: the parent
 * removes it only after this child exited, or never got to create it for us —
 * either way nobody is waiting on our result.
 *
 * Imports nothing cross-plugin (only `node:*` + `bun:ffi`): it is loaded by
 * path as a Worker, like host-semaphore's `flock-block.ts`.

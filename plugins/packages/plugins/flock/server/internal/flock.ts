 * `./singularity <anything>` would otherwise pay a dlopen before its first
 * statement. (2) It keeps the module importable in non-FFI contexts — type-only
 * consumers, tooling, a docgen pass — which a module-eval dlopen would break.

/**

 * process now holds it. `false` is "not acquired" — in practice always
 * EWOULDBLOCK (someone else holds it), since the other errno cases (EBADF,
 * EINVAL) mean the caller handed over a broken fd. Bun's dlopen surfaces no
 * errno, so the two are not distinguishable here; callers turn a persistent
 * `false` into a loud timeout rather than waiting forever.
 *
 * Non-blocking on purpose, and the only acquire this primitive offers: a
 * synchronous FFI `flock(LOCK_EX)` has no yield point, so it freezes the thread
 * it runs on until the lock frees — never acceptable on an event loop. Callers
 * that must *wait* poll this, or (host-semaphore) push the blocking wait onto a
 * worker thread.
 *
 * The lock is owned by the open file description, so it is released by
 * `flockRelease` OR by closing the fd OR **by the process dying** — SIGKILL,
 * OOM and power loss included. That last clause is the whole point: it is the
 * only lock ownership in this codebase that cannot be left stale by a process
 * that never got to run cleanup, and it is immune to PID reuse because no pid is
 * ever consulted.

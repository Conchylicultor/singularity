/**
 * Host-semaphore worker body — the ONLY place a *blocking* flock(2) runs.
 *
 * Runs as a `node:worker_threads` Worker spawned by `flock-wait.ts`. It opens one
 * lock file (path in `workerData.file`), blocks on `flock(fd, LOCK_EX)`, and posts
 * `"granted"` back to the parent once it holds the lock.
 *
 * Why a worker thread and not the main thread? A synchronous FFI `flock(LOCK_EX)`
 * has no yield point — the thread it runs on cannot observe stdin EOF or run signal
 * handlers while parked. If the blocking flock ran on `flock-wait.ts`'s MAIN thread
 * and that process were orphaned (its parent SIGKILLed, so nobody is left to send
 * SIGTERM), it could never see stdin close and would leak forever. Parking the block
 * on a *worker* thread keeps the child's main thread responsive to EOF and signals,
 * so the child can always exit and release. See the plan's orphan case.
 *
 * The fd is process-wide, so we deliberately never close it: process exit closes it
 * and the flock auto-releases. Holding it open here is what keeps the slot held.
 *
 * Imports nothing cross-plugin (only `node:*` + `bun:ffi`).

/**
 * Host-semaphore wait subprocess — waits for ONE lock file to become holdable and
 * signals its parent, without ever freezing on the blocking flock itself.
 *
 * Replaces the old `broker.ts`. Two roles, one script: the parent
 * (`server/internal/host-semaphore.ts`) spawns one of these per slot during fan-out
 * AND one for the turnstile. The single lock file to wait on arrives via env
 * (`HOST_SEM_LOCK_FILE`).
 *
 * Design — why the flock lives on a WORKER thread, not here:
 *   A synchronous FFI `flock(LOCK_EX)` has no yield point; the thread it runs on is
 *   frozen until the lock frees. If it ran on THIS main thread, an orphaned child
 *   (parent SIGKILLed, so nobody sends SIGTERM) could never observe stdin EOF and
 *   would leak the process — the exact orphan hole the old broker had. So the block
 *   runs on a `node:worker_threads` Worker (`flock-block.ts`) while this main thread
 *   stays responsive to stdin EOF and SIGTERM, guaranteeing the child can always
 *   exit and release its slot. (Measured: EOF-only and SIGTERM both exit cleanly.)
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  1. Spawn the worker; it blocks on `flock(LOCK_EX)` and posts "granted".
 *  2. On "granted" → write "granted\n" to stdout (guarding a dead parent).
 *  3. Hold the lock (the worker keeps its fd open) until the parent closes our stdin
 *     (EOF) or sends SIGTERM, then exit. Process exit closes the fd → flock releases.
 *
 * Imports NOTHING cross-plugin (only `node:*` + `bun:ffi` via the worker), so it
 * stays a standalone, independently-runnable script with no boundary concerns.

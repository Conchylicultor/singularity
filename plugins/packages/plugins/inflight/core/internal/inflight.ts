   * value or rejection). The key is released the moment that promise settles —
   * unless it has meanwhile been taken over by a fresher flight (see the
   * freshness floor below) — so the next call after settlement runs `fn` fresh.
   *
   * This is a *concurrency* deduplicator, NOT a cache: it only collapses work
   * that overlaps in time. Pair it with a TTL cache if you also want to reuse a
   * settled result. Because the shared body runs once, never use it to dedupe
   * operations whose callers each need a distinct side effect (e.g. mutations).
   *
   * It does, however, honour a caller-supplied FRESHNESS FLOOR (`opts.notBefore`):
   * *a flight that began before something you already know about will not serve
   * you*. Overlapping in time is the right sharing rule for a caller that only
   * wants the work done once; it is the wrong one for a caller that needs the
   * read to reflect a change that landed mid-flight. Such a caller passes the
   * instant it learned of the change, and a flight older than that is
   * SUPERSEDED — `onSupersede` fires, a fresh flight starts and takes over the
   * key, and every later arrival coalesces onto the fresh one. The old flight
   * keeps serving the joiners it already has; nothing is cancelled. Superseding
   * rather than chaining is deliberate: both bodies run either way, and chaining
   * would only make the fresh one start after the stale one finishes — doubling
   * the latency the fresh caller is waiting on. Admission control belongs to the
   * gate the caller wraps around `fn`, not here.

// `core/` here means RUNTIME-NEUTRAL NODE, not web-safe — it reaches `node:path`
// and `SINGULARITY_DIR`, exactly like `infra/file-sink/core` underneath it. It
// lives in `core/` so the `./singularity` CLI (whose runtime isolation gives a
// `core/` file only `core → core`) can write the record and a backend can read
// it back through the SAME declaration. This barrel must NEVER be imported from
// `web/`; the parent plugin's FFI-free `core/` is the web-safe half.

/**
 * Every line the host has recorded about a fatal signal, oldest-first.
 *
 * Goes through the sink primitive's bounded reader rather than a hand-rolled
 * `readFileSync` + `split("\n")`: it is positioned (never materializes the whole
 * file), it drops a half-flushed tail line — which this file WILL have, since
 * its writer is a process in the middle of dying — and `includeRotated` stitches
 * `signal-origin.jsonl.1`/`.2` back in. Reading rotations matters here and not
 * for a live tail: the question is always about ONE past run, and a busy host
 * can rotate past it.
 *
 * `missing` is folded to `[]` on one visible line rather than absorbed inside
 * the reader: no op on this host has ever caught a fatal signal, which is a
 * legitimately empty history and not a failure.
 *
 * Synchronous by contract — the same property that lets the writer run from a
 * signal handler, and the reason a caller may use this from any context.

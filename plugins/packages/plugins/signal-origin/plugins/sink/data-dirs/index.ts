 * The signal-origin record family: `signal-origin.jsonl` plus the two rotations
 * `defineFileSink` keeps beside it.
 *
 * A directory rather than three loose files at the root, because the rotations
 * ARE the history — and here that matters more than usual: for `check` and
 * `push`, which own no receipt anywhere else, this file is the ONLY record that
 * an op was killed and by whom, so a reader that stops at the last rotation
 * loses the incident outright.
 *
 * Declared by the sink rather than by the parent plugin: the parent's `core/` is
 * its FFI-free, web-safe half (`build/build-termination/core` imports it), and a
 * data-dir declaration reaches `paths/core`, which calls `homedir()` at module
 * scope. The sink's `core/` is already runtime-neutral Node for exactly that
 * reason, so the declaration belongs beside the writer.

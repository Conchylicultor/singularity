/**
 * Subprocess fixture for `signal-origin.test.ts`.
 *
 * A signal handler can only be observed from OUTSIDE the process that installs
 * it: the test has to arm a tap, get a third party to signal it, and then look
 * at what the victim recorded. So every assertion in the suite needs a real
 * child, and this file is that child — one entry point with a mode argument,
 * rather than N nearly identical scripts.
 *
 * It lives in the repo (not a tmp dir) because Bun resolves the `@plugins/*`
 * tsconfig alias relative to the importing file's project; a script written to
 * `/tmp` cannot import this plugin at all.
 *
 * Protocol — files, never pipes. The child writes into `--out <dir>`:
 *   ready       its pid, once the tap is armed and it is safe to signal
 *   origin.json what `readSignalOrigin` returned in the signal handler
 *   arm.json    what `armSignalOrigin` returned
 *   events      one line per lifecycle event (`listener-fired`, …)
 * Files rather than stdout so the test never holds a pipe on a child it is
 * about to kill (bun 1.3.13 can wedge on exit-during-stream-pull), and so a
 * record written microseconds before death is still readable afterwards.
 *
 * `events` accumulates in memory and is REWRITTEN whole on each event rather
 * than appended to: a whole-file write is a single `write(2)` on a fresh fd, so
 * it is at least as atomic as an append and keeps both properties above — the
 * file is on disk, complete, before `event()` returns. Appends are reserved for
 * the bounded-append sink primitive, which is what owns rotation repo-wide.
 *
 * Usage: bun signal-origin.fixture.ts --mode <mode> --out <dir>

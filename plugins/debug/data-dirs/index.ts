 *
 * Declared here, by the debug umbrella, because those monitors are shell scripts
 * run by launchd: they are outside the build, import nothing, and so can declare
 * nothing themselves. An undeclared directory written by a process the registry
 * cannot see is exactly the orphan this registry exists to prevent, and the
 * closest thing to an owner is the plugin family whose surfaces the monitors
 * exist to back up. The scripts spell the path; this declaration is what keeps
 * a sweep from treating it as unowned.

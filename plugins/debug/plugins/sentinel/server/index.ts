    "Cluster congestion sentinel: a main-only always-on sampler + onset detector + duress-latch lifecycle on a dedicated worker thread (host load, Postgres-side wait/lock/IO pressure, fleet state, per-backend health rollup, compressor pressure), feeding the 'cluster' trace ring so every trace gains a cluster-vitals lane, congestion onset is observable, and the latch lease survives a wedged main loop. Persists duress episodes as trip/clear lines on the duress-episodes channel (readDuressEpisodes). Reports the watcher's own supervision status: a host-global status file written on every transition, served on every backend as the sentinel.status push resource (with the duress latch), and a sentinel-down report when main gives up respawning it. Its worker writes the latest reading to a host-global vitals file every tick, served on every backend as the sentinel.vitals push resource.",

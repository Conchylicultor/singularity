// The `sentinel-down` report kind: main gave up respawning the machine watcher.
//
// Until this kind existed, giving up wrote one line to `logs/sentinel.jsonl` and
// nothing else — for a day in September 2026 the watcher crashed on every start,
// the duress latch never tripped, and builds piled onto a machine with ~70 MB
// free while every surface stayed quiet.
//
// Fixed fingerprint: the watcher is one per host and the reports row is keyed
// per worktree (always main here), so a second give-up is the same ongoing
// problem and bumps `count`.
//
// duressExempt: true — a dead watcher is exactly when the box may be in trouble,
// and the report describing the missing guard must not be shed by the guard's
// own machinery (the same argument as `duress-episode`).

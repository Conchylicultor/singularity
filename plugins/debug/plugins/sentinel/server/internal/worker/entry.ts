//
// SINGLE LATCH OWNER. Main never touches the latch: during the 2026-07-11
// 03:29 freeze the latch cleared MID-thrash because its per-tick refresh rode
// main's wedged event loop and the 60s lease lapsed. This thread has its own
// loop, so samples, trips, and — critically — lease renewals continue while
// main is frozen. If the whole process dies, the worker dies with it and the
// lease lapses within 60s: the fleet self-recovers (unchanged fail-safe).
//
// The setInterval below is the sentinel sampler's documented exception to the
// no-polling rule (see sampler.ts / the sentinel CLAUDE.md): it IS the
// diagnostic instrument for cluster duress, and anything queue- or loop-
// mediated would be starved by the congestion it measures.

// Import closure is deliberately lean: the latch sub-plugin barrel (node:fs +
// paths only), log-channels, the embedded-pg constants, and the pure detector
// / gatherers. No config_v2 (thresholds arrive as frames — a worker has no
// plugin runtime), no drizzle pool, no trace engine (main mirrors trips into
// captureTrace off the critical path).

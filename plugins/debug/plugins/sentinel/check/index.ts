 * be safe to evaluate bare.
 *
 * One convenience import broke that before: `worker/sample.ts` took two zod
 * schemas from health-monitor's SERVER barrel, which pulled in config_v2's
 * server side and the job queue (466 modules), and the worker died at load
 * reading a namespace nobody declared. This check makes the lean closure a
 * measured fact rather than a sentence in the CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * Measured with dynamic imports cut: the subject is what evaluates before the
 * worker's first statement. The failure prints the shortest import chain to the
 * first offending module under each forbidden prefix.

// The gateway's post-readiness boot report: after the proxy swap, the gateway

// socket — the same transport as its /api/health/ready polls, so this carries
// the same trust surface and needs no auth). The body IS the section's gateway
// shape (single source in trace/boot core): every field optional and unknown
// keys stripped, so a gateway/backend version skew in either direction can
// never fail the report or the section.

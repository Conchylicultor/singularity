// ── The render model ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// An op is ONE bar spanning `startMs → startMs + totalMs`, colored by kind,
// with each `waits[]` entry painted as an overlay segment at its own true
// offset INSIDE that span.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a `[wait][hold]` head-to-tail split. Waits interleave
// with real work — a build reads
// `[build-lock][…migrations/codegen…][duress-valve][host-grant][…heavy work…]` —
// and one op may carry SEVERAL waits of the same kind (a build re-queues for the
// host grant across duress requeue cycles). So: N segments at arbitrary offsets,
// and `sum(waits) + holdMs` is generally LESS than `totalMs`. The gaps are the
// op actually working — unless the machine slept through them: each `sleeps[]`
// entry is painted hatched on top (over a wait, too: a nap is never a wait).
//
// The bar's axis is the WALL clock (`requestedAt → +totalMs`), so a wait is
// placed by its wall fields (`atMs`/`wallMs`) when it has them; its
// `startMs`/`durationMs` are on the monotonic clock, which pauses while the
// machine sleeps and would sit too early after a nap. A legacy wait has only
// those, and is placed by them as before.

// ── Visual language ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three orthogonal channels so a bar is never ambiguous:
//
//   • TYPE_FILL answers "what is this?" — the base bar's fill, keyed on kind.
//     Cool/semantic hues. NEVER changes with status.
//   • WAIT_FILL answers "what is it blocked on?" — the overlay segments, keyed
//     on wait kind. Warm hues, drawn from the `categorical` token group (which
//     exists precisely to supply N mutually-distinguishable, light+dark-tested
//     hues — see plugins/ui/plugins/tokens/plugins/categorical). The warm/cool
//     split IS the gestalt: any warm patch on a bar means "not working here",
//     and its hue names WHICH resource — self-queued (push-mutex / build-lock)
//     vs. fleet-starved (host-grant) vs. duress-held (duress-valve). That
//     distinction is the entire diagnostic value of this pane.
//   • STATUS_TREATMENT answers "how did it go?" — layered on top of the fill:
//     ok → solid, in-flight → pulsing, failed/interrupted → red ring. Status
//     NEVER recolors the fill.
//
// This is why a running push is green+pulsing (not blue) and a failed build is
// blue+red-ring (not a different hue): color = type, ring = error.

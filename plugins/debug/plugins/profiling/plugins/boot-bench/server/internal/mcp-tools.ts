  description: `Repeatable cold-cache benchmark of the boot burst + live-state loaders in a worktree's RUNNING backend (no restart). Forces a truly cold boot by DELETING the L2 persisted snapshot rows for the boot-critical keys immediately before each cold iteration, so the boot-snapshot endpoint must recompute from loaders.

Measures, per iteration, all in the target process (so the event-loop histogram and the loaders share one process — no network noise in the measured window):
- boot-snapshot total time, per-key { source: persisted|loader, workMs }, AND \`persistedReadMs\` (the single batched L2 read; persisted per-key workMs is that read amortized ÷ N — directional, not per-key truth).
- edited-files first-subscribe latency (onFirstSubscribe + loader) for the conversation fixture.
- commits-graph (.delta / .graph) first-subscribe latency for the attempt fixture.
- event-loop lag (max) during the burst.
- runtimeProfile.loaders AND runtimeProfile.db: every loader/db aggregate touched, each decomposed per call into \`waits\` (per-call amortized wait union by gate layer, e.g. \`heavy-read-acquire\` / \`heavy-read-local\` — each ≤ wall), \`childMs\` (direct-child entry union), and \`selfMs\` (own work: wall − union(waits ∪ children)). A high \`avgMs\` with a high wait / low \`selfMs\` is head-of-line blocking, NOT a slow op — this is the signal the contention root cause needs. Cross-reference: \`firstSubscribe[key].loaderMs\` is the end-to-end load latency; \`loaders[key].selfMs\` + its \`waits\` is the SAME number split into work vs wait.

Scope = live-server cold: it deliberately EXCLUDES server-boot work (catch-up, derived-table rebuild, pool warm), which is noisier. Run on an idle backend for clean cold numbers (a concurrent flushNotifies can re-persist rows mid-run).

warm mode runs BEFORE any cold-clear (the snapshot is naturally warm on a running backend); cold per-key sources should be all "loader" and warm mostly "persisted" and faster. Discards the first \`warmup\` iterations of each set (GC settle). Returns per-mode { min, median, p95 } aggregates plus the resolved fixtures; the agent saves a baseline run and compares the after run itself.

BLOAT: \`snapshotBloat.{cold,warm}\` reports the \`live_state_snapshot\` table's { tableBytes, deadTuples, liveTuples }, captured ONCE per mode at the start of its set. The persisted-read cost only reproduces against REAL dead-tuple bloat — i.e. warm mode against an already-bloated DB (run with \`worktree: "singularity"\` to hit main). Cold-clearing DELETEs churn the very table being measured, so a fresh worktree shows misleadingly low bloat + low \`persistedReadMs\`; the bloat is captured before any cold delete so it reflects the pre-run state.

LOAD: \`loadConcurrency\` > 0 saturates the HOST-WIDE \`heavy-read\` gate with that many slot-holders during the burst, deterministically manufacturing the cross-worktree storm that serializes loaders. It contends with OTHER live worktrees for the duration of the run (realistic, bounded, auto-released). Use ≥ the host slot count to fully saturate; \`load.peakGateWaitMs\` (per mode) then rises materially vs an isolated run, proving the gate is contended. Default 0 = isolated.

Default: benchmarks the current conversation's worktree server. Pass \`worktree\` to target a different worktree (e.g. "att-1778089188-7uvf" or "singularity" for main). Pass \`conversationId\`/\`attemptId\` to pin the exact same fixtures across a before/after pair.`,

/**
 * Drive sustained contention on the host-wide `heavy-read` gate so a benchmarked
 * boot burst is forced onto the real broker wait path — reproducing the
 * cross-worktree storm that serializes loaders on `withHeavyReadSlot`.
 *
 * Occupants run on a private `createHostSemaphore` keyed by the SAME name the
 * live pool uses (`"heavy-read"`), so they contend for the IDENTICAL physical
 * flock slot files (`~/.singularity/heavy-read-slots/slot-N.lock`) — not a
 * separate gate. Each occupant CYCLES: acquire a slot, hold it for
 * `OCCUPANT_HOLD_MS`, release, immediately re-acquire — looping until stopped.
 * Cycling (rather than holding continuously until stop) is essential: the
 * measured burst's own heavy reads need a slot too, so a permanent hold would
 * deadlock the burst behind occupants that only release after it finishes.
 * Bounded holds keep the gate saturated on average while letting the burst
 * interleave and experience real head-of-line queue-wait — the "waiting, not
 * infinite block" the contention assessment describes. Bodies run inside
 * `runWithoutProfiling` so they hold real slots but emit NO spans into the
 * measured profile. No CPU spin anywhere — the backend is single-threaded, and a
 * spin would fabricate event-loop lag that pure gate contention never produces;
 * occupants are async slot-HOLDERS only.
 *
 * The returned promise resolves only once the gate is first SATURATED — all
 * `min(concurrency, heavyReadSlotCount())` slots held at once — so the caller
 * knows contention is in place before it opens the measurement window. Surplus
 * occupants (when `concurrency` exceeds the slot count) stay parked on the broker
 * slow path, adding realistic extra queue-wait; the barrier targets saturation,
 * not every occupant, so it never waits on a slot that physically cannot be
 * granted.

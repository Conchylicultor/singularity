// The writer. Emits the v2 change-only event stream (see
// research/2026-09-29-global-unified-op-status.md): one line per state CHANGE —
// `requested`, `wait-start`, `wait-end`, `requeue`, `granted` — and a
// self-contained `completed` summary as the terminal. Nothing is re-stamped: the
// reducer in `../../core` folds the deltas back into one state per op.
//
// Every event carries a per-op `seq` (so re-ingest is idempotent), the wall
// instant `at`, and `t` — monotonic ms since `requested`, the clock every wait
// offset is measured on so a wall-clock step cannot bend a duration — and, when
// the platform has one, `sleep`: the machine's sleep clock at `at`. The writer
// folds those stamps itself (through the reducer's own `advanceSleeps`) and
// puts the sleeps in the summary, and every wait carries its WALL extent
// (`atMs`/`wallMs`) beside its `t` one: `t` pauses while the machine sleeps, so
// only the wall axis puts a wait where it really was.
//
// Every method is a closure, never a `this`-dependent method: the push command
// passes `profiler.markLockRequested`-style bare references around, so a
// `this`-bound method would break at the first call site it is handed to.

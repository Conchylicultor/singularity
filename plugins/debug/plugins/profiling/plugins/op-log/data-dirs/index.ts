 * The unified op log family: `op-log.jsonl` plus the three rotations

 * A directory rather than four loose files at the root, because the rotations
 * ARE the history — this file is the one durable record of every build, push and
 * check the host has run, and a reader that opens only the live file silently
 * truncates that record at the last rotation.
 *
 * Host-global on purpose: an op's contention is a property of the box, so the
 * question "what else was running when this build stalled?" can only be answered
 * from one shared log.

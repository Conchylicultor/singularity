/**
 * The `span-stuck` report kind: **an operation is still running, long past the
 * point where anything on its path should take.**
 *
 * It fires WHILE the operation is stuck, which is the whole point: a slow-op
 * report is filed when a span completes, so a span that never completes files
 * nothing. That is how the 2026-09-11 flush stayed open for 25+ minutes with no
 * alert.
 *
 * Deduped per operation (`kind` + `label`): repeated stalls of the same
 * operation collapse onto one row whose count says how many runs got stuck.
 * The per-run bound (one report per span id) lives in the watchdog, not here.
 *
 * Variant `error`: an operation that never returns usually holds something
 * others wait on — a stuck flush freezes every live update in the worktree.

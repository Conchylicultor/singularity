// The stuck-span watchdog: a raw `setInterval` on the backend's own event loop,
// started from `onReady` and stopped in `onShutdown`.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A `defineJob`. A monitor must not run through the machinery it
// watches. This one watches, among other things, the jobs worker's own nested
// work and the live-state flush — and a scheduled job is dispatched by the same
// worker and would be queued behind the very wedge it exists to report. That is
// what happened to the queue monitor on 2026-08-17 (eleven copies of it sat in
// the frozen backlog it existed to report); the doctrine, and the structure
// this file copies — module-level timer, start/stop pair, `runTracked` tick —
// are written down in `plugins/debug/plugins/queue-health/server/internal/watchdog.ts`,
// itself modeled on the jobs plugin's stuck-lock sweeper.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: it rides the event loop it runs on, so a frozen LOOP
// silences it. That class belongs one level lower (the health sampler's stall
// detector, `debug/stall-monitor`). A monitor runs one level below what it
// watches, and no lower: an operation stuck on an await leaves the loop free,
// which is exactly the case this catches.
//
// WHY PER-BACKEND. The runtime profiler's open-entry registry is per-process
// memory, and reports are filed under this backend's worktree, so every backend
// watches its own process and nothing else — no backend can see, or
// double-report, another's spans. Supervised exec children run no `onReady`, so
// they run no watchdog either.

// 15 s, so a span past its threshold is filed within 15 s of crossing it. A
// module constant, not config, for the reason the queue-health watchdog gives:
// it is a property of the detector, not a knob. The thresholds live in
// `policy.ts`.

// The report source. The reports engine's source union has no entry for this

// dedicated source is a one-line change.

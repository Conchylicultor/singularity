 * tree is clean and published:
 *
 *   - No `# branch.oid` header ⇒ this is not parseable status output at all
 *     (empty stdout from a failed git, a truncated read). Previously an empty
 *     string sailed through as `{unpushedCount: 0, isDirty: false}` — "clean,
 *     nothing unpushed", the maximally-reapable answer.
 *   - No `# branch.ab` header ⇒ the branch has NO UPSTREAM. git only emits that
 *     line when a tracking branch exists, so a never-pushed branch produced no
 *     match and read as 0 unpushed. Every commit on such a branch exists ONLY in
 *     that worktree, which is the strongest possible reason not to delete it.

// A `git status` over a 690 MB checkout is a CPU/IO-heavy read (measured ~0.4 s
// warm, ~0.95 s cold), so the whole probe is one admitted, bounded, attributed
// unit — and every caller gets all three by calling this function, because the
// three wrappers live HERE rather than at the call sites:
//
//   1. `runTracked` — the probe is a first-class `bg` entry span. Without it the
//      reap job's git fan-out was 100% unattributed self-time: 200 captured
//      traces all read `childMs: 0` for a job that spends its life in git.
//   2. `withHeavyReadSlot` — the host-wide heavy-read budget (4 slots). Both
//      callers used to fan out unadmitted (the reaper 24-wide, the UI list
//      handler 50-wide), oversubscribing the host's entire sanctioned read
//      budget several times over from a background sweep.
//   3. `timeoutMs` — a wedged `git status` now fails in bounded time instead of
//      hanging the sweep (and, through it, the host-wide worktree-mutate flock).
//
// `background: true` demotes the child via taskpolicy; the reaper passes it (its
// probes must yield to interactive backends), the UI list handler does not (a
// human is waiting on it).
//
// FAILURE IS CONSERVATIVE, and the non-zero-exit check is the load-bearing half:
// `spawnCaptured` reports a failed command as a RESULT (`exitCode !== 0`,
// `timedOut: true`) rather than throwing, so a failed `git status` would
// otherwise reach `classifyGitStatus` with empty stdout — which is exactly the
// input that used to parse as "clean, 0 unpushed", the maximally-reapable
// answer. All three arms (throw, timeout, non-zero exit) funnel into
// HYGIENE_UNKNOWN.
//
// `opts.signal` is optional and ambient (the reap job passes its `ctx.signal`).
// It reaches both the heavy-read gate and the git child. Note the catch below:
// an abort arrives as a THROW of `signal.reason`, which is precisely the shape
// this function's conservative catch would otherwise absorb into
// HYGIENE_UNKNOWN — turning "you were told to stop" into a hygiene verdict. So
// the catch re-raises it before returning a default.

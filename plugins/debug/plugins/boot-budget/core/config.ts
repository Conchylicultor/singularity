// Per-phase wall-time budgets for the boot-budget monitor. The scheduled monitor
// job reads these live via getConfig each tick, so changes take effect on the
// next run without a restart. Mirrors opRateConfig's per-kind shape (one
// defineConfig with field factories rendered for free in Settings → Config).
//
// Budgets are per boot PHASE because the phases have very different natures — a
// single floor would drown the signal:
//   • onReadyBlocking is the HARD BARRIER before the backend serves (migrations /
//     registry only), so it must stay cheap → tightest budget.
//   • onReady runs CONCURRENT with request serving on the one event-loop thread,
//     so a long span competes with first requests → tight budget.
//   • onAllReady is a post-serving barrier → same tight budget.
//   • warmup is the DECLARED heavy deferred category (defineWarmup, throttled and
//     run after onAllReady), so it legitimately runs longer → loosest budget.
//
// The `name` is a load-bearing literal (persisted config); do not rename.

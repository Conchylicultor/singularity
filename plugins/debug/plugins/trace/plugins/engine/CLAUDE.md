# engine

The generic slow-event trace engine: the **open registry** of perf-event classes, the
`captureTrace()` entry point, and the durable `traces` store. It **never names a
class**, and neither does the pane — adding a perf signal to every trace and the
Gantt is one new plugin (a `defineTraceEventClass` contribution), zero engine edits.
Mirrors reports' `ReportKindSpec` + `defineServerContribution`.

## captureTrace — the one entry point

Any producer (`slow-ops`' span hook, the client slow-op endpoint, `op-rate`'s
op-time trip-wire, a future GC-pause detector) mints a `TraceTrigger` and calls
`captureTrace(trigger)`. It runs in the caller's hot path and **never throws into
it**; it returns `{ id }` (minted synchronously, so a report or a `slow_ops`
sample can reference the trace before it is even persisted) or `null` when
disabled / rate-limited. Two phases:

1. **Synchronous coherent-instant capture.** `atMs = performance.now()` is read
   once; admission runs first (one Map lookup — a storm never serializes); then
   every class's `captureAtTrip(ctx)` runs inline, with **no `await` between
   admission and the last capture**, so every section describes the *same
   instant*.
2. **Detached async enrich + validate + persist**, under `runWithoutProfiling`
   so the engine's own IO (a class's enrich query, the row insert) never
   re-feeds the profiler it was captured for.

## The TraceEventClass contract

A class contributes one snapshot section under `snapshot.events[id]`:

- **`id`** — stable lane/section id (`"spans"`, `"gates"`, `"contention"`,
  `"heap"`…). Also the Gantt lane key.
- **`schema`** — zod validator for this class's section. The persisted value is
  always `schema`-valid (see isolation below).
- **`captureAtTrip?(ctx)`** — **phase 1, synchronous, in the profiler hot path.**
  Must be cheap: no IO, no heavy allocation, and it should not throw (the engine
  guards it, but a throw wastes the coherent instant). Return `undefined` to
  skip. This is the ONLY place to read live in-memory state that changes
  instant-to-instant (`captureFlightWindow`, `readGateGauges`).
- **`enrich?(ctx, atTrip, ringSlice)`** — **phase 2, async**, run under
  `runWithoutProfiling`. Receives the phase-1 output and this class's ring slice
  (events overlapping `[windowStartMs, atMs]`). Use it for out-of-band reads that
  don't need the frozen instant (`contention` queries `pg_stat_activity` here).
  Return `undefined` to skip the section for this trip — no error, no report — so a
  class that only reacts to certain triggers opts out cleanly. When absent, the
  phase-1 output — or, failing that, the ring slice — is persisted directly.
- **`ring?: { max }`** — declare a bounded in-memory ring and the handle's
  `emit(event)` becomes live: a class that samples continuously (a future
  RAM/GC/CPU sampler) pushes `RingEvent`s, and the slice overlapping the trip
  window is persisted — **a Gantt lane for free**, no capture hook needed. A
  class with no `ring` gets a no-op `emit` (forgetting `ring` shows up as its
  events never appearing, never a throw).

**Schema-validation isolation** (covered by `server/internal/capture.test.ts`).
Each section is validated independently in the async phase; a class whose
`captureAtTrip`/`enrich` throws, or whose output fails its `schema`, is **omitted**
from `events` and a server error report is filed. One bad class never kills the
whole snapshot and never fakes a section, so a *present* key is always valid.

## Admission (the `trace` config)

Checked before any capture work (`server/internal/rate-limit.test.ts`); all four knobs
live-editable in Settings → Config, read synchronously at trip time via `getConfig`.
They govern *how often* a trigger persists — **not** what counts as slow (each
producer owns its own threshold):

- **`enabled`** — when off, `captureTrace` is a no-op (existing rows untouched).
- **`cooldownMs`** (10 s) — min time between two traces for the same
  `kind:label` trigger. A repeatedly-tripping op produces one trace per window.
- **`maxPerMin`** (30) — hard global per-minute ceiling across all triggers, so a
  slow-event storm can't saturate the engine. A cooldown rejection does not
  consume a minute token.
- **`windowMs`** (10 s) — *minimum* lookback; the actual captured window is
  `max(trigger.durationMs, windowMs)`, so a long trip always covers its own
  lifetime.

Admission is shared across all trigger sources — a slow-span storm can consume
the global budget and starve an op-time capture in the same minute. Acceptable:
op-time runs on a 5-min cadence and retries next tick.

### Duress shedding (after admission)

During a host **duress episode** (`infra/duress`), an admitted non-critical trip
past the first-N-per-trigger grant is **shed**: the entire capture — including the
synchronous coherent-instant phase, exactly the cost shedding exists to avoid — is
skipped and the caller sees `null`, the same contract as a rate-limited trip. Only
an accounting **stub** (`kind`/`label`/`wallTime`/`durationMs`) is buffered; its
replay is a documented no-op (the coherent instant is gone by flush time — no fake
traces), and the stubs fold into the post-episode `duress-shed` summary report. The
gate sits **after** admission so cooldown / rate-limit semantics stay primary — a
cooldown rejection never consumes a first-N grant. A `critical` trigger (cluster
onset, frozen-backend stall) bypasses it entirely: duress is precisely when that
trace matters. See `internal/trace-shed.ts`.

## Clock domains

Every snapshot stores **two clocks**, and mixing them is the classic trap:

- **Profiler clock** (`performance.now()` domain): `atMs`, `windowStartMs`, and
  every span's `t0`/`t1`, plus `RingEvent.tMs`. These only ever compare **to each
  other** — they are the Gantt's x-axis (`t − windowStartMs` → window-relative
  ms). Never compare a profiler-clock value to `Date.now()`.
- **Wall clock** (`wallTime`, ISO): the single anchor to human time. Display
  wall time for a span as `wallTime + (t − atMs)`.

## Storage & retention

One `traces` row per trip (`server/internal/tables.ts`). The table and the `Trace`
wire schema both derive from the single `traceFields` record (`core/fields.ts` via
`defineEntity`), so column/schema drift is unrepresentable. The full `TraceSnapshot`
is one zod-pinned **jsonb** blob (`snapshot`) — deliberately not normalized: its
`events` sections are class-owned open shapes, and SQL columns would freeze them and
defeat the open registry. The flat `triggerKind` / `triggerLabel` / `durationMs` /
`thresholdMs` columns are list metadata: `GET /api/traces` reads them and **never
selects the (tens-of-KB) blob**.

- **`ExcludeFromChangeFeed` — yes.** A trace is inserted *exactly* when the system
  is already loaded, so per-statement live-state invalidation would push a recompute
  cascade at the worst moment and can self-amplify (slow → more traces → more notify
  → slower) — the same recorded reason `slow_ops` is excluded. The Slow Events list
  therefore hydrates on open (`GET /api/traces`, newest first), no live resource.
- **7-day TTL sweep** (`debug.trace-cleanup`): a `defineJob`, `singleton`,
  `perWorktree`, daily cron. A trace is debugging evidence, not a durable
  artifact; retention is a code constant, not config.

## How to read a snapshot (the blocking-chain walk)

Viewed in the **Debug → Slow Events** Gantt. The **trip row** is pinned first; the
`spans` lanes, `gates` strip, and `contention` card fill in below. To find *what
blocked the victim*:

1. **`trigger.detail.waits` names the layer** the victim queued on — e.g.
   `"heavy-read-acquire": 3500` means 3.5 s of the trip's wall-clock was spent
   waiting on that gate, not on its own work. The Gantt paints these as positioned
   *wait bands* at their true offsets, colored per layer — so the same gate lines
   up as one color across every co-queued row.
2. **The `gates` strip shows saturation at the same instant** — `active 4/4,
   queued 11` on that layer confirms the gate was the bottleneck. Gate names use
   the `chargeWait` layer vocabulary, so `trigger.detail.waits`, each span's
   `waits`, and the `gates` keys all join directly.
3. **The `spans` tree names the holder — read it, don't guess it.** The co-queuers
   are the rows whose `waits` include the saturated layer; the **holder** is the one
   with dominant `selfMs`/`childMs` among them. Walk the trip row's subtree — its
   children are literally the work it was blocked behind. Click any bar for its
   label, kind, t0/t1 (wall + relative), ancestor chain, and wait/child/self split.
   (The nesting is exact, read off per-instance ids — see `trace/spans`.)
4. **The `contention` card** distinguishes "queued behind a gate" from "the whole
   host was saturated" — a high `loadAvg` vs `cpuCount`, or a spike in pg
   backends, points at host/DB pressure rather than a single holder.

The tree's shape and band offsets are exact, but the window it is drawn from is
bounded by the recorder's own limits (the ≥5 ms flight-ring floor, unresolvable
parents rendering as flagged orphan roots, the `WAIT_BAND_CAP` drop — see
`infra/runtime-profiler`). Two of those surface as UI text: a wait whose position was
dropped or clamped off the window edge reads `Nms unpositioned` (never painted), and
a trace captured before wait bands existed reads *position not captured
(pre-wait-band trace)* and paints no band at all.

## Adding a new event class

Create a sub-plugin under `trace/plugins/<class>/` and list a `defineTraceEventClass`
handle in its `server/index.ts` `contributions` array:

```ts
// server/internal/class.ts
export const heapClass = defineTraceEventClass({
  id: "heap",
  schema: HeapSectionSchema,            // validates snapshot.events.heap
  // Cheap synchronous read at the trip instant (or omit for an enrich/ring class):
  captureAtTrip: (ctx) => readHeapGauge(),
  // OR: async out-of-band enrichment that doesn't need the frozen instant:
  // enrich: async (ctx, atTrip, ringSlice) => ({ ... }),
  // OR: a continuously-sampled ring — emit(...) elsewhere, get a lane for free:
  // ring: { max: 240 },
});

// server/index.ts
contributions: [heapClass.contribution],
```

Then give it a `Trace.Lane` on the web side keyed by the same `id` (see
`spans` / `gates` / `contention` for the three shapes: per-kind bars, an occupancy
strip, a footer card). Skip the web lane and the class still shows up — the pane's
`GenericEventLane` fallback renders unregistered sections as point markers +
expandable JSON.

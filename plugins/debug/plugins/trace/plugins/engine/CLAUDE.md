# engine

The generic slow-event trace engine. It owns the **open registry** of perf-event
classes, the `captureTrace()` entry point, and the durable `traces` store. It
**never names a class** and the pane never names a class — adding a perf signal
to every trace and the Gantt is one new plugin (a `defineTraceEventClass`
contribution), zero engine edits. Mirrors reports' `ReportKindSpec` +
`defineServerContribution`.

## captureTrace — the one entry point

Any producer (`slow-ops`' span hook, the client slow-op endpoint, `op-rate`'s
op-time trip-wire, a future GC-pause detector) mints a `TraceTrigger` and calls
`captureTrace(trigger)`. It runs in the caller's hot path and **never throws into
it**; it returns `{ id }` (minted synchronously, so a report or a `slow_ops`
sample can reference the trace before it is even persisted) or `null` when
disabled / rate-limited. Two phases:

1. **Synchronous coherent-instant capture.** `atMs = performance.now()` is read
   once; admission runs first (one Map lookup — a storm never serializes); then
   every class's `captureAtTrip(ctx)` runs inline, with **no `await` between
   admission and the last capture**, so every section describes the *same
   instant*.
2. **Detached async enrich + validate + persist**, under `runWithoutProfiling`
   so the engine's own IO (a class's enrich query, the row insert) never
   re-feeds the profiler it was captured for — the same suppression discipline
   as flight-recorder's old `trip.ts`.

## The TraceEventClass contract

A class contributes one snapshot section under `snapshot.events[id]`:

- **`id`** — stable lane/section id (`"spans"`, `"gates"`, `"contention"`,
  `"heap"`…). Also the Gantt lane key.
- **`schema`** — zod validator for this class's section. The persisted value is
  always `schema`-valid (see isolation below).
- **`captureAtTrip?(ctx)`** — **phase 1, synchronous, in the profiler hot path.**
  Must be cheap: no IO, no heavy allocation, and it should not throw (the engine
  guards it, but a throw wastes the coherent instant). Return `undefined` to
  skip. This is the ONLY place to read live in-memory state that changes
  instant-to-instant (`captureFlightWindow`, `readGateGauges`).
- **`enrich?(ctx, atTrip, ringSlice)`** — **phase 2, async**, run under
  `runWithoutProfiling`. Receives the phase-1 output and this class's ring slice
  (events overlapping `[windowStartMs, atMs]`). Use it for out-of-band reads that
  don't need the frozen instant (`contention` queries `pg_stat_activity` here).
  When absent, the phase-1 output — or, failing that, the ring slice — is
  persisted directly.
- **`ring?: { max }`** — declare a bounded in-memory ring and the handle's
  `emit(event)` becomes live: a class that samples continuously (a future
  RAM/GC/CPU sampler) pushes `RingEvent`s, and the slice overlapping the trip
  window is persisted — **a Gantt lane for free**, no capture hook needed. A
  class with no `ring` gets a no-op `emit` (forgetting `ring` fails loudly by its
  events simply never appearing, never a throw).

**Schema-validation isolation.** Each section is validated independently in the
async phase. A class whose `captureAtTrip`/`enrich` throws, or whose output fails
its `schema`, is **omitted** from `events` and a server error report is filed —
loud (a report) and isolated (like a slot error boundary). One bad class never
kills the whole snapshot and never fakes a section, so a *present* key is always
valid. This is the noise-rules per-rule try/catch discipline applied to sections.

## Admission (the `trace` config)

Checked before any capture work, all four knobs live-editable in Settings →
Config (read synchronously at trip time via `getConfig` — in-memory, cheap, no
restart). They govern *how often* a trigger persists — **not** what counts as
slow (each producer owns its own threshold):

- **`enabled`** — when off, `captureTrace` is a no-op (existing rows untouched).
- **`cooldownMs`** (10 s) — min time between two traces for the same
  `kind:label` trigger. A repeatedly-tripping op produces one trace per window.
- **`maxPerMin`** (30) — hard global per-minute ceiling across all triggers, so a
  slow-event storm can't saturate the engine. A cooldown rejection does not
  consume a minute token.
- **`windowMs`** (10 s) — *minimum* lookback; the actual captured window is
  `max(trigger.durationMs, windowMs)`, so a long trip always covers its own
  lifetime.

Admission is shared across all trigger sources — a slow-span storm can consume
the global budget and starve an op-time capture in the same minute. Acceptable:
op-time runs on a 5-min cadence and retries next tick. If it bites, per-source
budgets are a config-only extension.

## Clock domains

Every snapshot stores **two clocks**, and mixing them is the classic trap:

- **Profiler clock** (`performance.now()` domain): `atMs`, `windowStartMs`, and
  every span's `t0`/`t1`, plus `RingEvent.tMs`. These only ever compare **to each
  other** — they are the Gantt's x-axis (`t − windowStartMs` → window-relative
  ms). Never compare a profiler-clock value to `Date.now()`.
- **Wall clock** (`wallTime`, ISO): the single anchor to human time. Display
  wall time for a span as `wallTime + (t − atMs)`.

## Storage & retention

One `traces` row per trip (`server/internal/tables.ts`), the boot-profile
storage precedent. The `traces` table and the `Trace` wire schema both derive
from the single `traceFields` record (`core/fields.ts` via `defineEntity`), so a
column/schema drift is unrepresentable. The full `TraceSnapshot` is one
zod-pinned **jsonb** blob (`snapshot`) — written once, read whole by one pane,
never queried per-span, and its `events` sections are class-owned open shapes, so
normalizing would freeze the payloads into SQL and defeat the open registry. The
flat `triggerKind` / `triggerLabel` / `durationMs` / `thresholdMs` columns are
list metadata: `GET /api/traces` reads them and **never selects the (tens-of-KB)
blob**.

- **`ExcludeFromChangeFeed` — yes.** A trace is inserted *exactly* when a span
  tripped its slow threshold — i.e. when the system is already loaded. Wiring
  per-statement live-state invalidation onto it would push a recompute cascade at
  the worst moment and can self-amplify (slow → more traces → more notify →
  slower) — the same recorded reason `slow_ops` is excluded. The Slow Events list
  therefore **hydrates on open** (`GET /api/traces`, metadata only, newest first)
  with a Refresh button, no live resource.
- **7-day TTL sweep** (`debug.trace-cleanup`): a `defineJob`, `singleton`,
  `perWorktree`, daily cron. A trace is debugging evidence, not a durable
  artifact; retention is a code constant (the `bootTraceCleanupJob` precedent),
  not config.

## How to read a snapshot (the blocking-chain walk)

Viewed in the **Debug → Slow Events** Gantt (the old flight-recorder dumped this
to dead-end JSONL). The **trip row** is pinned first; the `spans` lanes,
`gates` strip, and `contention` card fill in below. To find *what blocked the
victim*:

1. **`trigger.detail.waits` names the layer** the victim queued on — e.g.
   `"heavy-read-acquire": 3500` means 3.5 s of the trip's wall-clock was spent
   waiting on that gate, not on its own work. In the Gantt this is the victim's
   leading *wait* segment (position approximate — waits are stored as union
   totals, not intervals; the detail strip labels it so).
2. **The `gates` strip shows saturation at the same instant** — `active 4/4,
   queued 11` on that layer confirms the gate was the bottleneck. Gate names use
   the `chargeWait` layer vocabulary, so `trigger.detail.waits`, each span's
   `waits`, and the `gates` keys all join directly.
3. **The `spans` lanes whose `waits` include that layer are the co-queuers.** The
   span among them with dominant `selfMs`/`childMs` overlapping the window is the
   **holder** — the op actually occupying the gate while everyone else queued.
   Click any bar for its label, kind, t0/t1 (wall + relative), parent chain, and
   wait/child/self split in the bottom detail strip.
4. **The `contention` card** distinguishes "queued behind a gate" from "the whole
   host was saturated" — a high `loadAvg` vs `cpuCount`, or a spike in pg
   backends, points at host/DB pressure rather than a single holder.

Caveats surfaced in the UI: spans carry no per-instance ids, so `parent` is
`{kind,label}` and exact tree reconstruction is heuristic for concurrent
same-label spans (the Gantt groups by kind, shows parent chains in the strip);
completed spans <5 ms never enter the flight ring, so the Gantt shows ≥5 ms
completed spans only.

## Adding a new event class

Create a new sub-plugin under `trace/plugins/<class>/` (a `heap` / `gc` / `cpu`
sampler) and list a `defineTraceEventClass` handle in its `server/index.ts`
`contributions` array:

```ts
// server/internal/class.ts
export const heapClass = defineTraceEventClass({
  id: "heap",
  schema: HeapSectionSchema,            // validates snapshot.events.heap
  // Cheap synchronous read at the trip instant (or omit for an enrich/ring class):
  captureAtTrip: (ctx) => readHeapGauge(),
  // OR: async out-of-band enrichment that doesn't need the frozen instant:
  // enrich: async (ctx, atTrip, ringSlice) => ({ ... }),
  // OR: a continuously-sampled ring — emit(...) elsewhere, get a lane for free:
  // ring: { max: 240 },
});

// server/index.ts
contributions: [heapClass.contribution],
```

Then give it a `Trace.Lane` on the web side keyed by the same `id` (see
`spans` / `gates` / `contention` for the three shapes: per-kind bars, an
occupancy strip, a footer card). Skip the web lane and the class still shows up —
the pane's `GenericEventLane` fallback renders unregistered sections as point
markers + expandable JSON, so a new class is **visible by default, never
silent**. No engine edit, no `*-in-sync` codegen: the snapshot is self-describing
(its `events` keys) and the dispatch fallback covers the rest.

// Derive the report's dedup grain + label from the raw stall evidence.
//
// This is the one place that turns "the stacks that were on the frozen loop" into
// a stable fingerprint and a human-readable label — a presentation concern, so it
// lives here (in the alert plugin) rather than mutating the evidence
// `StallSection`.
//
// Fingerprint = the STACK, not the leaf. A real flaw caught in review: on the
// Jul-7 stall `topLeaves[0]` is `JSON.parse [native]` — a generic native frame
// shared by every JSON caller — so a leaf-based fingerprint misattributes and
// collapses unrelated JSON-heavy freezes into one row. The top STACK
// (`parseTranscript ← readEntries ← …`) names the actual caller path, is already
// line-free (names only, robust to edits), and distinguishes callers that share a
// native leaf. That rationale is unchanged and load-bearing: `culpritStack` is
// `topStacks[0].stack` verbatim, and changing it would fork every existing dedup
// row.
//
// The LABEL is derived from THAT SAME STACK's own frames — never from the
// independent `topLeaves` histogram. Why this is structural, not a tweak: the
// aggregator builds `topLeaves` and `topStacks` as two separately-sorted
// populations, so a label drawn from `topLeaves` can describe a DIFFERENT stall
// than the one `culpritStack` fingerprints. It did: a `spawn`-rooted freeze (7 of
// 15 samples, `spawn ← listPanes ← … ← collectLive`) was titled
// `is @ …/drizzle-orm/entity.js:7` — a 1-of-15 frame with nothing to do with the
// freeze — because the old scan filtered `topLeaves` for ` @ `, skipped the
// unattributed-but-dominant native `spawn`, and landed on an arbitrary cold tie.
// Reading `topStacks[0].frames` makes label/fingerprint coherence hold BY
// CONSTRUCTION: both now describe the same stack, so they cannot drift apart.
//
// Both the label and the fingerprint guard the empty section: `aggregateTraces`
// returns empty arrays when `total === 0`, so we never index `[0]` blindly — the
// `?? …` fallbacks cover it.

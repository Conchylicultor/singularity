// Tunable per-kind call-rate thresholds for the op-rate monitor. The scheduled
// monitor job reads these live via getConfig each tick, so changes take effect
// on the next run without a restart. Mirrors slowOpConfig's per-kind shape (one
// defineConfig with field factories rendered for free in Settings → Config).
// Each threshold is "calls in one monitor window" (the cron interval); a kind
// trips when its per-op delta since the previous tick exceeds the threshold.
// `db` / `flush` are inherently high-count (every query / every internal notify
// cycle), so they carry looser thresholds — a single floor would drown the
// signal.

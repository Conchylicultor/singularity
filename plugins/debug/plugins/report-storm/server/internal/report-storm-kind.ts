// The `report-storm` kind: what a burst of alerts becomes once the reports
// engine's fan-out ceiling collapses it. The fingerprint keys on (collapsed
// kind, window start), so each window of a long incident gets its own row
// naming its own roster, and two kinds storming at once never dedupe onto each
// other.
//
// Variant `warning`: a storm means the alerts you would have received were
// folded, which a human should see — and the fact that identifies the bug (N
// unrelated operations went slow at once) exists only in this row. No
// notification cooldown: each window is already its own row, so re-arming
// would only duplicate it.
//
// `fanOutExempt` is the load-bearing flag: this report IS the fan-out
// mechanism's accounting. Without the exemption a long enough incident — one
// storm rollup per window, past the ceiling — would collapse the rollups
// themselves, and the record of what was collapsed would be the thing
// collapsed. Same reason `duress-shed` declares `duressExempt`.

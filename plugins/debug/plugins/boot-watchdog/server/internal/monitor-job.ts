// would re-file the SAME dead outage each minute. Keying on `wt:processStartedAt`
// (the boot's identity) makes each superseded attempt file at most once per main
// process. Across a main restart the module reloads with a fresh Set, so a
// superseded wedge still inside the window re-files once — but collapses onto its
// stable fingerprint row (`boot-wedge:<worktree>`), bumping `count`. This is
// boot-budget's exact dedup pattern; OPEN wedges deliberately bypass it (see

// boot channel off the shared filesystem (readBootEvents — exactly how the
// timeline reads them) even while the owning backend is wedged, and files a
// deduped `boot-wedge` report for any boot that never reached its `ready` line

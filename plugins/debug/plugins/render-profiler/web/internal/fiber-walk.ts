 * fn runs, but it does NOT clear it on a fiber whose subtree *bails out* (when
 * an ancestor short-circuits and no work-in-progress is built, the fiber is
 * never touched). So a fiber that rendered once at mount and has only ever been
 * skipped since keeps `PerformedWork` set in `flags` *forever* — and a full-tree
 * walk on every commit would re-report it as a fresh render. This is exactly the
 * `Core.Root` controller set (mount once, return null, never re-render): the old
 * flag-only test reported all ~20 of them as re-rendering on *every* commit
 * triggered by *any* unrelated component.
 *
 * The authoritative discriminator is **object identity across commits**. React
 * double-buffers fibers: a genuine render swaps `current` ↔ `alternate`, so the
 * committed fiber is a *different object* than the one at that position last
 * commit; a bailed/skipped fiber is the *same object* (with its stale flag).
 * `prevSeen` holds the component fibers visited last commit, so a fiber still
 * present there did not render this commit — regardless of its `PerformedWork`
 * flag. (A bail-out that *does* build a work-in-progress resets `flags` to none
 * via `createWorkInProgress`, so the flag check already excludes it; this guard
 * covers the no-work-in-progress skip that leaves the flag stale.)

/**
 * Iterative DFS over the committed tree. Two jobs in one pass:

 *    rendered fiber along that path, so its re-render came from its own
 *    state/context/subscription, not propagation. Once we pass through a rendered
 *    component fiber, deeper renders on that path are propagation (we mark
 *    `ancestorRendered` true for the subtree), but sibling subtrees keep their
 *    own per-path flag, so multiple independent updates in one commit surface.
 *    "Rendered" is `fiberRenderedThisCommit` — `PerformedWork` set AND a fiber
 *    object not seen last commit (`prevSeen`), so a stable subtree carrying a
 *    stale `PerformedWork` flag is NOT mistaken for a re-render (see that fn).
 *    Every component fiber visited is added to `currentSeen` for next commit.
 *
 * 2. **Remounts.** Every fiber gets a purely **index-based** `positionKey`
 *    (`parent + "/i:" + fiber.index`) — React's authoritative per-parent slot.
 *    Positions *inside a rendered subtree* are recorded (with the occupant's
 *    `key`). A **freshly-placed** fiber (`isFreshlyPlaced`: `alternate === null`
 *    AND React's `Placement` flag set) at a slot the *previous* commit also
 *    occupied is a candidate remount; we then decide remount-vs-benign-reorder
 *    by asking whether the prev occupant was actually destroyed: if it was keyed
 *    and that key still appears among the new fiber's current siblings, it merely
 *    moved (suppress); otherwise it was rebuilt (remount). Requiring `Placement`
 *    (not just `alternate === null`) is load-bearing: a fiber that mounted once
 *    and has since only ever bailed out keeps `alternate === null` forever, so
 *    the `alternate`-only test reported every stable idle subtree (e.g. the whole
 *    `Core.Root` controller set) as a phantom remount on each re-render. This now
 *    catches all real causes with zero false positives — an index-only key would
 *    flag a list prepend, a key-only key would miss identity-churning
 *    `key={uuid()}` remounts, and an alternate-only mount test would flag stable
 *    bailed-out fibers.

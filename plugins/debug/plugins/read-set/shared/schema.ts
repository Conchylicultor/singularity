// other view — declaring a second contract over the same route is the
// established pattern, and zod strips unknown keys so the two coexist.
//
// We model only what this pane reads (zod strips the rest), and every field is
// REQUIRED: the server always emits them (central degrades each to `[]` /
// `null` / `false`), so a response that omits one fails loudly instead of
// reading as an entry with no reads, no routes or no drift. `policy` is parsed
// against the runtime's closed set, so a new policy the pane does not know is a
// parse error, not a silently-dropped entry.

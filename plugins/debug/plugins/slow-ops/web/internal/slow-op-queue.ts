// The browser-side queue behind the two client slow-op signals (page-load,
// element-settle). The collector used to POST once per slow element, so a boot
// wave that re-settled 200 resources sent 200 requests — each a DB transaction
// plus a report upsert — against the backend that was already the thing
// failing. Queueing collapses that burst into one request per ~250 ms.
//
// Shaped after `plugins/primitives/plugins/log-channels/web/client-log.ts`: a
// module-level buffer, ONE trailing debounce timer, a hard cap that drops the
// oldest while carrying the drop count forward, and chunked `keepalive` POSTs
// bounded by the server-side max. It carries none of clientLog's retry/backoff
// machinery on purpose — this is a `report: false` fire-and-forget beacon, and
// a failed batch is dropped exactly as a failed single POST was before.
//
// This queue is TRANSPORT ONLY. It never filters, thresholds or suppresses a
// signal: every slow settle the collector observes still reaches recordSlowOp
// with the same attribution. See the "Cold-start slowness is UX truth" section
// of ../../CLAUDE.md.

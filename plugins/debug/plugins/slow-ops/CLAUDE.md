# slow-ops

Durable, deduped store + recorder for slow operations, fed by server `onSlowSpan`
and the `POST /api/slow-ops/client` endpoint. Viewer: the `pane` sub-plugin
(Debug → Slow Ops).

Client `element` signals attribute to their route — they pass
`caller: { kind: "route", label: location.pathname }`, which the recorder merges
into the row's `callers` so the pane shows e.g. `↳ route:/agents/c/123 ×N`.

## Cold-start slowness is UX truth — don't suppress it

The `element` signal measures a resource's mount → first-data settle = the
**time-to-content** the user waits through on a fresh load. A slow boot wave is a
**real UX regression, not noise** — never filter the post-deploy burst.

It shouldn't happen: the gateway hot-swaps only after `GET /api/health/ready`
returns `200` (post `onReadyBlocking` barrier: migrations + pool/table warm-up),
so "ready" means the next request is *fast*. A cluster of slow ops right after a
swap = readiness flipped too early → a **readiness/hot-swap defect to fix at the
source**, never to mute. See `gateway/CLAUDE.md`, `plugins/database/CLAUDE.md`,
and `research/2026-06-14-global-cold-load-instant-boot.md`.

### Transport cold-start attribution (enrich, don't suppress)

A resource's mount → first-data settle is ~100% wait on the notifications
transport (the client does no compute — it awaits the server value). On a cold
deep-link the socket itself comes up late (its cross-tab-election `onElected` is
starved by cold-boot main-thread saturation), so the settle wall-clock lands on
whichever resource happened to mount — mislabelling e.g. `sonata-key-auto-detect`
as "slow" when nothing about that resource is slow. To keep the signal honest
**without suppressing it**, the `element` signal now carries additive root-cause
attribution: `useResource` reads `NotificationsClient.getFirstReadyAt()` and, when
the transport was not ready at mount, reports `transportColdStart` + the
bring-up `transportWaitMs`. The server charges that wait to a
`notifications-transport` layer in the durable `waits` (wait-vs-work split, no
migration) and stamps `transportColdStart` into the report `data`, so the task
title gains `— transport cold-start` and the description points the fix at
transport/boot readiness rather than the resource. The full duration still fires
and is still recorded — this is *attribution*, not a filter.

## The client beacon is batched — transport only

The browser does not POST once per slow element. `web/internal/slow-op-queue.ts`
queues each signal, waits ~250 ms (one trailing debounce, never a poll), and
sends the accumulated items as ONE request, chunked to
`MAX_CLIENT_SLOW_OP_ITEMS`, `keepalive`, with a `pagehide` flush so a queued
signal is not lost when the tab goes away. On the server, one batch is one
contention snapshot and one Postgres transaction (`recordSlowOpBatch`).

This exists because the old shape amplified the very stall it reported: during
the 2026-09-02 incident a reconnect re-settled ~420 resources at once, and the
op-rate monitor recorded `POST /api/slow-ops/client — 43.2s across 438 calls`,
each call a DB transaction plus a report upsert plus a notification insert,
against the backend that was already failing. See
`research/2026-09-02-global-alert-fan-out-ceiling.md`.

**Batching is a transport change and nothing else.** No signal is filtered,
thresholded, deduped or delayed out of existence on the way — every element
settle that trips today still reaches `recordSlowOp` with the same
`transportColdStart` / `transportWaitMs` / `caller` / `clientBoot` attribution,
and the section above still holds in full. The only loss the queue can cause is
its 1000-item cap, and that loss is counted and sent as the batch's `dropped`
field, which the handler writes to the `slow-ops` log channel — never silently
discarded.

`recordSlowOp(input)` is `recordSlowOpBatch([input])`, so the server-span hook
and the client beacon remain ONE funnel with one set of semantics.

## Slow jobs (the `job` kind)

Background job runs flow through the same pipeline as HTTP/loader ops. The jobs
dispatcher records each `job.run()` as a `job` span (label = the job name), so a
run slower than its threshold files **one deduped report per job name**
(fingerprint `slow-op:job:<jobName>`) with caller attribution, exactly like a
slow route (an investigation task is filed on demand from Debug → Reports).

The threshold is the job's declared **hold class ceiling** —
`defineJob({ hold })`, 10 s / 2 min / 30 min (`jobs/core/hold.ts`). That is what
makes a wrong `hold` loud: a job declaring `instant` and spending 10 s working
files a report naming itself, every tick, until it is reclassified or fixed. A
job expected to run long still raises its own bar with
`defineJob({ slowThresholdMs })`, which wins outright; the `slow-op` config
`jobMs` (default **3000 ms**) is the fallback for a job name this backend has no
registration for — a queue row written by a plugin this composition does not
load.

**A job is judged on WORK time (`durationMs − waitMs`), not on wall-clock hold**
— alone among the span kinds. A job's slot-hold is substantially not a property
of the job: `jobs.dead-gc` was measured holding a worker slot 77 s to do 254 ms
of work, the rest blocked on `background-tx-acquire`, an admission gate entered
*after* graphile had handed it a slot. Judging hold would file a report against a
correctly-classified job every time that gate got busy. Both halves of the
decision — which quantity (`slowSpanMs`) and which bar
(`resolveSlowThreshold`) — live in `resolve-threshold.ts`; see
`plugins/infra/plugins/jobs/CLAUDE.md` § "Hold class". The recorded row still
carries wall-clock `durationMs` plus its per-layer `waits`, so the split stays
readable off the row.

The profiler pre-filter floor is `perfFloorMs` — `min(config thresholds, class
ceilings)`, so a class ceiling below a config knob is still reachable. A per-job
`slowThresholdMs` below that floor is still not honored, which remains a
non-issue for the expected-slow-job use case (the override is meant to raise the
bar).

## Plugin reference

- Description: Records slow client operations (page load, element appearance) into the durable slow-op store via the slow-ops client endpoint. Durable slow-op store: deduped per-operation aggregates with caller attribution, plus the slow-op report kind. Subscribes to runtime-profiler slow spans and client signals; files one deduped report per distinct slow operation (investigation task filed on demand).

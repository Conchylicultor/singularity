// a threshold below the floor is a threshold nobody can ever reach.

/**
 * The quantity a span is judged on.
 *
 * Wall-clock for every kind EXCEPT `job`, which is judged on **work time**
 * (`durationMs − waitMs`): the part of the run that is actually a property of
 * the handler.
 *
 * A job's slot-hold is substantially not its own doing. `jobs.dead-gc` was
 * measured holding a worker slot for **77 s while doing 254 ms of work** — the
 * rest blocked on `background-tx-acquire`, an admission gate entered *after*
 * graphile had already handed it a slot. `debug.session-divergence-monitor`:
 * 25.6 s hold, 4.2 s work. `mail.sync-tick`: 85% wait. Judging a job on hold
 * would file a slot-hog report against a correctly-classified `instant` job
 * every time the DB background lane got busy — punishing it for someone else's
 * congestion, and training every author to inflate their `hold` class until the
 * signal is worthless.
 *
 * `waitMs` is a wall-clock-overlapping OVERLAY, not an additive component: the
 * recorder accumulates it as an interval union over the span's own timeline, so
 * `waitMs ≤ durationMs` holds at every level and this subtraction can never go
 * negative (`runtime-profiler/core/recorder.ts`, "Wall-clock decomposition").
 * Only *named gate* waits count as wait — a model call's latency is work, which
 * is what makes a `seconds` job's own timeout the thing that bounds it.
 *
 * Note this is deliberately NOT `selfMs`. `selfMs` also subtracts child-span
 * execution, which would credit a job for the work its own DB queries did. For
 * a leaf-shaped handler the two coincide (`77,111 − 76,858 = 253 ≈ selfMs 254`);
 * where they differ, work-including-children is the quantity a hold class means.
 *
 * The recorded slow-op row still carries wall-clock `durationMs` plus its
 * per-layer `waits`, so the wait-vs-work split stays recoverable from the row.

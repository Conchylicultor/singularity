// `slow_ops` is a deduped UPSERT aggregate: one row per (operationKind,
// operation, worktree), and every threshold-exceeding occurrence bumps its
// counters and stamps `lastSeenAt`. The DISTINCT-operation set grows without
// bound and has never had a retention bound.
//
// The age column is `lastSeenAt` (last recurrence), NOT `firstSeenAt`: we want
// to expire operations that STOPPED recurring, not rows first seen long ago but
// still hot. A slow op that keeps tripping keeps its `lastSeenAt` fresh and is
// retained; one that stopped ages out 30 days after its last occurrence and is
// re-created from scratch if it ever recurs.
//
// `perWorktree: true`: `slow_ops` lives in the per-worktree DB fork, so the
// sweep must run in every worktree backend (each over its own rows).

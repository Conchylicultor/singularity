// Writes the per-boot lines to the persisted `boot` log channel →
// ~/.singularity/worktrees/<wt>/logs/boot.jsonl: one `start` line at the
// register phase, one `ready` line from `onReady`. The two pair by
// processStartedAt (readBootEvents), so a backend that wedges during
// migrations / onReadyBlocking leaves an unpaired start — visible on the
// timeline exactly during deploy-restart bursts, previously a blind spot.
//
// A log-channel line, not a DB table: no migration, survives DB re-forks, and
// stays readable from the main backend's disk scan even while this backend is
// wedged. Bounding: the file sink already rotates every channel file at a
// 128 MB cap — at two ~140-byte lines per boot that is effectively unbounded
// history, so no custom rotation here.

// queue's facts to a colour, a one-line summary, and the next instant any of it
// could change on its own.
//
// Pure on purpose. The server runs it on every pulse load, so the colour, the
// timer that re-evaluates a silent queue, and any future agent read cannot
// disagree about what "the queue needs a look" means. Every line it draws is
// derived from the jobs class table (`pickupTargetMsFor`, `deadlineMsFor`) or
// from this plugin's config — nothing here restates a duration.

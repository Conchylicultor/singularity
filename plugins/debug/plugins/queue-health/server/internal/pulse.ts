// The health report's Job queue row, as a live value.
//
// PUSH-BASED, with no poll. Graphile's tables live outside the schema the DB
// change feed covers, so the feed never invalidates this; it is served external
// (`source: "external"`), and notified — only while a tab is subscribed, since
// `whileSubscribed` is what hands out `notify` — by two things:
//
// - the jobs plugin's queue-activity signal (`onQueueActivity`): a job started
//   or finished in this backend, a row was inserted, or the jobs plugin itself
//   touched the queue (cancel, retry, GC, the stuck-lock reclaim);
// - ONE timer, armed at the verdict's `nextChangeAt` — the next instant the
//   colour could change with no event at all (a waiting job crossing its
//   threshold, a running one reaching the stuck line, a death aging out). A
//   wedged queue emits nothing, and must still turn amber on time. This is a
//   deadline, not a poll: it fires at the instant the answer changes, and each
//   load re-arms it.
//
// `throttleMs`: a burst of activity (a fan-out enqueue, a queue draining) costs
// one load per second.
//
// The loader reads the database only through the jobs plugin's introspection
// API (`no-db-backed-notify` flags a `db.` inside an external `serveValue`
// call). Deaths need nothing extra: graphile emits `job:complete` after writing
// a final failure, and the dead-job GC that moves rows into the `dead_jobs`
// archive announces activity itself.

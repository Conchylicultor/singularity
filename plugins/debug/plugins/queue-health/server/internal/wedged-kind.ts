// Why a fourth kind when the 2026-08-17 incident strictly satisfied both
// existing conditions: "the queue is deep" (`queue-backlog`) and "something is
// slow" (`queue-slot-hog`) are routinely true and benign — the nightly
// `backup.run` trips slot-hog every night, and a burst of enqueues trips
// backlog. Neither says the thing an operator has to act on. This kind fires
// only when every slot is held by the SAME live jobs across consecutive samples
// while ready work waits: nothing is completing, so nothing behind it will ever
// start. Different urgency (variant `error`, not `warning`), different renderer,
// different re-arm.
//
// One rolling report per worktree (fixed fingerprint — the reports unique index
// is (fingerprint, worktree), so worktrees never collide). No lane dimension
// yet: the queue is one shared pool today, and per-lane wedges arrive with the
// lane runtime (`research/2026-08-17-global-bounded-job-execution.md`, Phase 5).

  // is silenced by the outage. That is Silencer 2 of the 2026-08-17 incident,

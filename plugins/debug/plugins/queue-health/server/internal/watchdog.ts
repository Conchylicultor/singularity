// The queue-health watchdog: a raw `setInterval` on the backend's own event
// loop, started from `onReady` and stopped in `onShutdown`.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A `defineJob` ANY MORE. It used to be one —
// `debug.queue-health-monitor`, `{ cron: "*/5 * * * *", perWorktree: true }` —
// and on 2026-08-17 main's queue wedged for 70 minutes with eleven copies of
// that monitor sitting in the frozen backlog it existed to report. A monitor
// queued behind the failure it detects detects nothing. The doctrine was
// already written down, in this repo, on `jobs/server/internal/stuck-lock-sweeper.ts`:
//
//   "Why this stays a raw setInterval and NOT a scheduled defineJob: it is the
//    recovery mechanism FOR the job system. Routing it through graphile's own
//    queue would mean a wedged worker (the exact failure this clears) couldn't
//    run its own recovery — a deadlock. Infra that recovers the job system must
//    not depend on the job system."
//
// This file is that doctrine applied to the alarm rather than the recovery, and
// it is modeled on the sweeper byte for byte: module-level timer, start/stop
// pair, `runTracked` wrapper, `.catch → console.warn`, plus an exported
// `queueHealthTickOnce()` for forcing a tick instead of waiting for the next
// one (the sweeper's `sweepOnce`).
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN `debug/queue-health` AND NOT BESIDE THE SWEEPER IN `jobs`: the
// plugin DAG forbids the other placement. `reports/server/internal/record-report.ts`
// imports `recordNotification` from `shell/notifications`, whose barrel imports
// a `defineJob` from `jobs` — so `jobs → reports → shell/notifications → jobs`
// is a cycle, and `no cycles` is enforced by `./singularity check
// plugin-boundaries`. This plugin already imports both `jobs` and `reports`, so
// the placement adds zero new plugin edges, and it keeps queue INTERPRETATION
// (thresholds, config, report kinds) out of the load-bearing mechanism-only
// `jobs` plugin.
//
// Known escalation, deliberately not built: this rides the same event loop it
// watches, so a wedged LOOP silences it. That failure class belongs one level
// lower — the sentinel's worker thread — per the rule that a monitor runs
// exactly one level below the subsystem it watches, and no lower.

// 30s, so six samples fit in the default three-minute wedge window. The window
// is the trip condition; the cadence only decides how many independent samples
// prove it. At six, one slow or skipped tick cannot false-negative a real wedge
// — and the wedge test needs consecutive samples of an UNCHANGED locked set, so
// too few samples would make a single lucky sample decide an outage alarm.
//
// A module constant, not config, for the same reason the sweeper's

// operator tunes. `wedgeMinutes` is the tunable one.

//
// The cadence is also the measurement window: the check averages hold and wait

// also the signal that would have named the 40-minute `tasks.push-ingest` lag
// that started this design — a whole class of work not moving while the queue
// looked busy.
//
// WHY "DID ANYTHING DRAIN" AND NOT "IS THIS TIER SATURATED". The obvious test —
// count the slots this class is occupying and compare against `reachableSlots`
// — is not answerable: the three runners share one `_private_jobs` table and
// graphile records no runner id per row, so a locked row cannot be attributed to
// the runner holding it. "Is the seconds tier full" therefore has no answer.
// "Did anything in this class drain" does, it is exact, and it costs nothing
// beyond the aggregate this tick already took.
//
// Two conditions, both continuous for the class's own window:
//
//   1. the HEAD DID NOT MOVE. The class's oldest ready row is also the next row
//      graphile will pick from it (`getJob` orders `priority asc, run_at asc`,
//      and every row of a class carries that class's priority), so a head that
//      has not advanced means nothing was taken off the front. The head is
//      identified by its `run_at`, derived as `now - oldestOverdueMs` — an
//      unmoved head's derived timestamp is constant, while a drained one jumps
//      forward to the next row's.
//   2. the READY DEPTH DID NOT FALL below where the candidate opened. This is
//      what keeps a fan-out burst honest: `emit()` writes N rows with nearly
//      identical `run_at`, so a burst DRAINING still looks like a frozen head
//      within the drift tolerance — but its depth falls every tick, which resets
//      the candidate.
//
// KNOWN RESIDUAL, stated rather than papered over. A row can be ready and still
// unpickable: graphile's fetch skips a row whose `serial` queue name is locked
// by a running sibling. If such a row sits at the head while the rest of the
// class drains AND arrivals keep the depth at or above the candidate's opening
// value, both conditions hold and this fires — a real stall of that class's
// head, but caused by one blocked lane rather than by the ladder. Ruling it out
// would need a per-class COMPLETION counter, which nothing exposes today: the
// runtime profiler counts completions per jobName, not per class, and mapping
// one to the other would mean reaching into the job registry from here. The
// depth condition catches the common shape (the class visibly drains) and the
// report names the jobs at the head, which is enough to tell the two apart by
// eye.
//
// The window is the LONGER of `wedgeMinutes` and the class's own work ceiling.
// A flat three minutes would be nonsense for `minutes`, whose conforming runs
// may legitimately hold every reachable slot for half an hour; three minutes of
// a frozen `instant` head, whose ceiling is ten seconds, is already damning.

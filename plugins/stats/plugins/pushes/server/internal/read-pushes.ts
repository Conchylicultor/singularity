 *
 * Two exclusions, both deliberate, both required for an aggregate to mean
 * anything:
 *
 * - **In-flight ops** (`closed_by IS NULL`). An unfinished push has no final
 *   outcome (throughput cannot say success or failed), its wait is still
 *   growing, and it has no steps yet — counting it would make a chart depend on
 *   when it was loaded.
 * - **Interrupted ops.** Hard-killed and closed by the reconciler (or a
 *   worktree's ingest-gap close). They carry no real duration and no steps — a
 *   synthetic zero, not a measurement.
 *
 * `closed_wait_ms` is `sum(waits.durationMs)` — every wait the push blocked on,
 * including the nested host-grant wait inside its `checks` step.

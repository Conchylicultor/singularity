// ─── What this is ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The PERMANENT record of token usage, and the reason this plugin's numbers stop
// being retroactively rewritten.
//
// Claude Code deletes transcripts after `cleanupPeriodDays` (default 30) and
// `infra/corpus-index`'s `refreshCorpus` drops vanished paths, so every chart is
// derived from a corpus that silently loses its own past — ~2,000 conversations
// of history are ALREADY unrecoverable on this machine.
//
// That single fact — **there is no source of truth to rebuild this file from** —
// is what makes this module's error handling deliberately unlike every sibling
// cache in the tree:
//
//   • a schema-version mismatch NEVER discards (unlike `loadCorpusFile`, which
//     treats one as empty and rebuilds from disk — safe there, catastrophic
//     here);
//   • a corrupt shard THROWS (unlike the old `loadPricing`, which returned
//     `undefined` on a `SyntaxError` — right for a cache, but here the next
//     flush would overwrite a recoverable file with an empty one);
//   • merge is live-wins-EXCEPT-on-shrink, so an in-place truncation upstream
//     cannot delete tokens we have already banked.
//
// Persistence is year-sharded (`sessions-<YYYY>.json`) and each shard is written
// as a whole-file atomic snapshot (temp + rename), so `sink-safety`'s append rule
// does not apply. `defineFileSink` would be exactly wrong: it ROTATES, and for an
// archive whose entire value is its oldest data, rotation IS the failure mode.

 * - a path only in live becomes a new entry stamped at `ARCHIVE_SCHEMA_VERSION`;

 *   archived partial wins and the event is returned in `shrunk`.
 *

 * than `load-usage.ts`'s `ConvMeta` on purpose: `load-usage.ts` imports THIS
 * module, so importing back would close a cycle and drag `db` into every consumer.

 * synchronous `JSON.stringify` — the same shape that makes `refreshCorpus`'s
 * whole-file rewrite of `index.json` a stall risk. Old shards become immutable in
 * practice, which also makes them cheap to back up.
 *
 * Each shard is serialized with its keys sorted, so the bytes are a pure function
 * of the data (a `Map`-order-dependent serialization would churn every shard on
 * every flush) and the change comparison against the file on disk is meaningful.
 *
 * **Contract:** `merged` must be a superset of `loadArchive(dir)` — i.e. the
 * load → merge → flush cycle. A shard may be rewritten to `{}` when every entry
 * it held moved to another shard (an entry's `lastActivity` crossing a new year),
 * and that is only non-destructive because those entries are still somewhere in
 * `merged`. Do not call this with a partial map.

//
// ccusage applies its 200k tier PER ENTRY: for one token kind with `t` tokens it
// charges `t*base` when `t <= 200k`, else `200k*base + (t-200k)*tiered`
// (`data-loader-9ESMosno.js:4739-4756`). Naively that means cost can only be
// computed while you still hold the individual entries — i.e. at parse time,
// forcing dollars to be baked into the archive.
//
// It is decomposable, because both halves are linear in the entry:
//
//     Σ f(t_i) = base · Σ min(t_i, 200k) + tiered · Σ max(0, t_i − 200k)
//
// So storing the two sums per token kind — `below = Σ min(t,200k)` and
// `above = Σ max(0, t−200k)` — reproduces the EXACT per-entry-tiered cost from
// tokens alone, at rollup, from an aggregate we can accumulate at parse time.
// That is what keeps the archive re-priceable forever instead of freezing
// whatever the price table happened to say the day a transcript was parsed.
//
// The `speed` multiplier is a whole-entry scalar, not a per-token rate, so it
// cannot be folded into these sums — it is a bucket KEY dimension instead.
//

// ─── What these are ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The two ways the permanent cost archive can be quietly WRONG, each surfaced as
// its own report kind rather than a log line nobody reads:
//
//   • `cost-unpriced-model` — the price table has no entry for a model the
//     corpus used, so its buckets contributed $0. `priceBucket` refuses to
//     express that as a price, so this is the only place the fact can land.
//   • `cost-archive-shrink` — a transcript came back with FEWER tokens than the
//     archive already banked for it, i.e. it was truncated in place. The archived
//     value wins (see `mergeLive`), and this is the record that it happened.
//
// Both are `warning`, not `error`: charts still render, they are just missing
// dollars or explaining a divergence.

// Re-alert at most once per ~24h. Both conditions are steady-state — an unpriced
// model stays unpriced on every read until the table learns it, and a truncated
// transcript stays truncated — so a shorter re-arm would just re-ring the bell
// for a fact the user has already seen, and no re-arm at all would let a
// months-later recurrence pass silently.

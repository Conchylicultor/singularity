/**
 * The server half of `release.candidate`: what `ship` would pick for one
 * `(composition, platform)`, read off the bundle directory and git.
 *
 * **Why external.** Its truth is the filesystem (`resolveBundle`, the exact
 * call `./singularity deploy ship` makes) and git (`compareToHead`), neither of
 * which the change feed can see. It recomputes on exactly the edges that can
 * move the answer:
 *
 * - **HEAD moved** — `recomputeOn: [refHeadServed]` (staleness is relative to
 *   HEAD);
 * - **a candidate release of this pair closed** — `noteCandidateClosed`, from
 *   `closeReleaseRow`, notifies this one tuple. The CLI claims the
 *   `latest-<platform>` pointer before it exits, so by the time the row closes
 *   the new bundle is on disk.
 *
 * A hand-run `./singularity release` writes no row and so notifies nothing; it
 * is seen on the next HEAD advance, release close or remount — the known limit
 * of a registry nothing watches.
 *
 * The memoized observation itself — signature, close epoch and the freshness
 * floor that keeps `observedAt` honest — is `createCandidateObserver`.

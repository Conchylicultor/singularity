/**
 * The release plugin's first tests, and they cover the decision the migration
 * made testable: what a finished `./singularity release` MEANS.
 *
 * Everything else the old `run-release.ts` did on the way to that verdict —
 * probing pids, reading a parent-written recovery artifact, closing orphan rows
 * — now belongs to the supervised-run primitive and is tested there. What is
 * left here is release-specific and pure: the manifest is the artifact's own
 * receipt, and a signal is an OBSERVATION that must never be re-derived from the
 * exit code.

/**
 * Wait, durably, for a release this workflow enqueued — across any number of

 *
 * **This is what a caller sequencing a release uses instead of awaiting a
 * promise**, and the difference is the whole point of the migration: the Deploy
 * app's `update` used to `await runRelease(...)` in-process for tens of minutes
 * between its converge and its ship legs, and that await is precisely the window
 * the 2026-08-28 incident died in — an unrelated `./singularity build` signalled
 * the process group and the deploy went with it. `ctx.waitFor` returns from the
 * handler through the jobs plugin's suspend sentinel, so nothing is holding
 * anything while the release runs, and the sequence resumes as a fresh dispatch
 * in whichever backend is alive when the release ends.
 *
 * It lives HERE rather than in the consumer because every fact it needs is this
 * plugin's: the kind id the event filters on, the ledger the outcome is read
 * from, and what a missing row means. A consumer that reached for those would be
 * re-deriving release's own semantics.
 *
 * **Observe before waiting.** The first thing this does is read the ledger, not
 * suspend — a release that is already over (or was never claimed) is answered
 * immediately rather than after an interval, and a lost event costs one wake
 * rather than the sequence.
 *
 * `name` prefixes the durable wait names, so a resume re-walks the same
 * suspensions in the same order rather than minting fresh ones. It must be
 * unique within the calling workflow.

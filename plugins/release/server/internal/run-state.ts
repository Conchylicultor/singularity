 * the caller is the reconciler, which knows only `(kindId, runId)`.

 * `finishedAt` is the exit marker's **mtime**, never `new Date()`. A reconcile
 * that stamps its own `now` inflates the run's Duration by the whole gap between
 * the child exiting and something noticing — often the length of a restart — and

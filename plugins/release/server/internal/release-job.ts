 * Deploy app's `update`) has to name the run it is waiting on before that run
 * exists, because `ctx.waitFor(runEnded, { where: { kindId, runId } })` filters
 * on the id. Minting it here would leave the waiter with nothing to filter on.
 * The id is only a name — the LOCK is still the claiming INSERT below.

/**
 * One `./singularity release`, as an ordinary durable job.
 *
 * The handler claims the composition's single in-flight slot, spawns a detached
 * child and SUSPENDS — it holds a worker slot for milliseconds, not for the
 * twenty minutes a release takes. It is woken by the child's exit marker in
 * whichever backend is alive by then.
 *
 * **This is what replaced `runRelease` and its waiter map.** A supervised run's
 * outcome does not come back from the call that started it — it arrives at the
 * kind's `finish`, driven by a file watcher — and `internal/driving.ts` used to
 * absorb that inversion by handing the terminal to a promise the starting
 * process was holding. That worked only while the process lived, which is
 * exactly what the Deploy app's `update` could not rely on: it awaited a release
 * in-process for tens of minutes, and an unrelated `./singularity build` ended
 * both. `ctx.waitFor` is that mechanism now, and it is durable, so the map is
 * gone rather than generalised.
 *
 * Nothing awaits this job as a promise. A caller enqueues and gets the run id
 * (`enqueueRelease`); a caller that needs the outcome waits for it durably
 * (`awaitRelease`).
 *
 * `runAttempts` is left at the default 1: a failed release stays failed and
 * visible, and re-running one is a decision, not a retry budget.

 * **The memo.** Signature = `rev-parse HEAD` ‖ `bundleSignature` (stat-only:
 * the pointer's target, the manifest's mtime and size, the packed binary's
 * existence) ‖ this pair's close epoch. The resource's `revalidate` is that same
 * signature, so the ETag and the value cannot disagree. A recompute whose
 * signature did not move is a cache hit returning the SAME value, which the
 * runtime's no-op suppression then drops. A failed compute is not cached (a
 * corrupt `RELEASE.json` throws out of `resolve`), so it is the value's error
 * arm and the next read retries.
 *
 * **The close is what keeps `observedAt` honest.** The client holds its release
 * info `loading` while the candidate provably predates the newest run
 * (`observedAt < latest.finishedAt` for a refusal); after a close, an
 * observation that predates it would hold that gate forever, because nothing
 * notifies the pair again until HEAD moves. Two ways one could leak through,
 * and one guard each:
 *
 * - a **cache hit** — a close whose bundle signature happened not to move (a
 *   run that succeeded yet claimed no pointer) keeps the old `observedAt`. The
 *   close **epoch** in the signature makes it a miss.
 * - a **joined flight** — a compute started before the close (a HEAD-advance
 *   recompute, a row mounting) and still in its `compareToHead` spawn would be
 *   joined by the post-close miss and hand back its pre-close value. The close
 *   **instant** is passed as the memo's `notBefore`, so such a flight is
 *   superseded, not joined.
 *
 * The epoch carries the process's boot instant, so an ETag minted by a previous
 * process never matches one minted by this one.

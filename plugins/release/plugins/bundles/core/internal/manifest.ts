 * wants to know what a bundle IS without re-deriving it from the path.
 *
 * `commitSha` / `commitDirty` are optional because bundles cut before
 * provenance existed carry neither. Absent ⇒ the source state is *unknown*,
 * which is a state of its own (see `Staleness`), never "current".
 *
 * Unknown keys are stripped rather than rejected: a newer CLI adding a field
 * must not make an older reader refuse an otherwise-shippable bundle. A
 * MALFORMED manifest is different — `.parse()` throws, and that throw is the
 * point: a corrupt RELEASE.json is not a refusal a user can act on, it is a
 * broken artifact.

/**
 * The ONE directory ship looks in for a composition's bundles, resolved once.
 *
 * **Which namespace it keys on, and why.** `releaseOutDir` roots every release
 * at `<SINGULARITY_DIR>/releases/<namespace>/<comp>-<target>/`, and the
 * namespace is a PARAMETER on both sides — the producer names it, the reader
 * names it, and they agree because each kind of process answers the same
 * question the same way:
 *
 * - **hand-run release + hand-run ship** — both mint the namespace from the
 *   CHECKOUT they were invoked from (`checkoutNamespace(root)`), so a release
 *   cut in a worktree is found by a ship run from that same worktree.
 * - **Studio-triggered release + UI-triggered ship** — both run inside the
 *   worktree backend, so both name that backend's runtime namespace.
 *
 * The remaining mismatch is the CROSS pair (a Studio release, then a hand-run
 * ship from a DIFFERENT checkout), and it is deliberately left as a loud miss:
 * this function is never called for more than one namespace, and every refusal
 * carries the absolute path it looked in. Searching both namespaces would make
 * "which bundle am I shipping?" ambiguous, which is strictly worse than a miss
 * you can read in one line.

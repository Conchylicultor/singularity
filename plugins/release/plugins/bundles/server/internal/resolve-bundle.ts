/**
 * Resolve which bundle to ship for `(composition, platform)`.
 *
 * The canonical filesystem layout IS the registry (see
 * `plugins/release/CLAUDE.md`, §Discovery) — there is no DB query: run dirs
 * under {@link bundleRoot}, a `latest-<platform>` symlink at the current packed
 * one, and a self-describing `RELEASE.json` inside each.
 *
 * Every manifest field is cross-checked against something ELSE that knows it, so
 * a mismatch is caught here — loudly, by name — rather than at `systemctl
 * start`, where it would present as a crash loop.
 *
 * Failure is a `{ ok: false, refusal }` value, not an exit: this is asked both
 * by the CLI (which prints and exits) and by an HTTP handler (which cannot).
 * A *corrupt* RELEASE.json is not in that union — `ReleaseManifestSchema.parse`
 * throws, because a broken artifact is not a refusal a user can act on.

 * - where `latest-<platform>` resolves to, or that it does not (`no-pointer`);
 * - the run's `RELEASE.json` mtime and size (`no-manifest`, and every check
 *   the manifest's fields feed — a rewrite moves at least the mtime);
 * - whether `dist/<comp>-web-<platform>` exists (`not-packed`).
 *
 * It does not cover an explicit `release` — the candidate is always the
 * pointer's run, and that is the only question this answers. DB-free, like
 * everything in this plugin, so a CLI process can import it.

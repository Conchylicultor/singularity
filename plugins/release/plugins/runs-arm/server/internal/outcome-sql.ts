 * leak straight into `outcome`, where it is not a member of the vocabulary, and
 * the failure would surface as a zod throw far from the column that caused it. A
 * `Record<ReleaseRun["status"], RunOutcome>` makes widening a `tsc` error here

/**
 * The shared `outcome`, from the release ledger's own status column.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate. There is **no `else`**: a status outside the map
 * projects NULL, and `UnionRunSchema`'s `RunOutcomeSchema` throws on it rather
 * than an unlabelled row reaching the list — `outcome-sql.test.ts` drives a
 * value the map does not cover through it to hold that true. And the `::text`
 * cast is on the whole expression, because every arm of a `UNION ALL` has to
 * agree on a column's type and that is not a thing to leave to Postgres' literal
 * resolution.
 *
 * Takes the status column as an argument rather than closing over
 * `_releaseRuns.status`, so the suite can evaluate it over a parameter and needs
 * no table, no migration chain and no fixture rows.

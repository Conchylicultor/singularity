/**
 * The release arm's outcome mapping, on a real Postgres.
 *
 * Smaller than the build arm's suite because there is far less to get wrong:
 * `release_runs.status` is already a three-value closed set, so the mapping is
 * one-to-one and there is no second encoding to drift against. What IS worth
 * evidence is the claim the expression makes by having no `else` — that a status
 * the map does not cover projects NULL, so `RunOutcomeSchema` throws rather than
 * an unlabelled row reaching the list. That is exactly the kind of assertion
 * that is easy to write in a comment and quietly untrue in SQL.
 *
 * The expression is evaluated over a parameter rather than over `release_runs`,
 * so the suite needs no table, no migration chain and no fixture rows.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/release/plugins/runs-arm`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

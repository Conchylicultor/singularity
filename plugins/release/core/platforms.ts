/**
 * The closed set of platforms a release can be built for, and the derivations
 * every consumer needs from a tag.
 *
 * A closed list both runtimes need lives here as plain data rather than behind a
 * slot — the same call `RELEASE_TARGETS` makes next door. Three very different
 * consumers read it, which is exactly why the derivations live with the list
 * instead of at each call site:
 *
 * - the release CLI resolves `--platform`, then needs the Bun compile target and
 *   the Go `GOOS`/`GOARCH` for the same tag;
 * - the Deploy health probe parses `uname -sm` into a tag it can store;
 * - `ship` compares a bundle's tag against a server's observed tag.
 *
 * Getting the Bun target prefix or the Go arch spelling wrong is a silent
 * mis-build (a Mach-O binary wrapping a Linux payload, or vice versa), so both
 * mappings are single-sourced here.

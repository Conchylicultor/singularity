/**
 * The wire schemas for the two verdicts the `release.candidate` value carries
 * across the network: bundle discovery's `BundleResolution` and provenance's
 * `Staleness`.
 *
 * Both TYPES are owned by `@plugins/release/plugins/bundles/core` — that plugin
 * is the single authority on what a bundle is and why it isn't shippable, and it
 * stays free of any transport concern (a CLI process asks it the same question
 * with no HTTP anywhere in sight). What lives here is only their *serialization*,
 * which is this plugin's value's business.
 *
 * The `satisfies ZodParser<…>` on each schema is what keeps the two from
 * drifting: adding a refusal case, or a field to one, makes THIS file a tsc
 * error rather than a runtime `.parse()` failure in the browser. Never relax it
 * to a cast.

/**
 * What `ship` would pick for one `(composition, platform)`, as the

 *
 * **The filesystem says whether a shippable bundle exists and matches** — that
 * is `resolution`, the EXACT value `ship` itself acts on, so a UI renders
 * `bundleRefusalMessage(resolution.refusal)` verbatim and never re-derives
 * shippability. `staleness` is how its recorded provenance relates to HEAD.
 *
 * There is no `run`: a value read off the filesystem and git cannot also carry
 * a `release_runs` row (a DB read inside an external value is invisible to the
 * change feed). The newest run is its own read — the routed `release.history`
 * window, limit 1 — and a consumer orders the two by `observedAt`.
 *
 * `observedAt` is when the server last looked: the start of the newest
 * observation this value describes (a fresh one is taken whenever a release
 * closes, HEAD moves, or the bundle on disk changed). A run that FINISHED
 * before `observedAt` is reflected in `resolution`; one that finished after it
 * may not be yet.

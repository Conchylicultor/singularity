 * WHY a release is being cut — the one input that decides whether the artifact

 *
 * A discriminated union rather than `{ dev?: boolean; platform?: PlatformTag }`,
 * so **"a candidate always names its platform"** is unrepresentable-otherwise at
 * the call site instead of being a rule the argv builder has to remember. The
 * two members map onto exactly two argv shapes:
 *
 * - `staged` → `--dev`, host platform: staged only, never packed, claims no
 *   `latest-<platform>` pointer. This is Studio's existing behaviour, byte for
 *   byte.
 * - `candidate` → `--platform <tag>` and NO `--dev`: it must PACK, or it is not
 *   shippable, and it must be built for the platform the target host reports.

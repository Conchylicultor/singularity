// One task's mode, read by the task's id. The mode is 1:1 with its task — the
// side-table's primary key IS the task (`taskId`, stored as `parent_id`) — so
// it is a lookup-only collection: no default window (nothing lists every
// task's mode), minting `task-efforts:rows` alone. A reader asks with
// `useLiveRow(taskEfforts, taskId)`, and `found: false` is "no mode set".
//
// Every consumer asks about ONE task and needs an exact answer — the launch
// option's picker both reads and writes this row — so a point read is the
// right bound rather than a window, which could silently render a set mode as
// "none". The `:rows` point routing sends a write to a tuple iff the changed
// ids intersect its set, so setting one task's mode never sweeps the table.
//
// NOT preloaded (a lookup-only collection cannot be): it hydrates post-mount
// via its sub-ack. Served from the extension handle in
// `server/internal/resource.ts`.

  row: TaskEffortSchema,

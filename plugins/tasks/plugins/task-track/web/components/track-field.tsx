 * which the tasks DataView can group and filter by (`enum` + `value`).
 *
 * While the tracks are not known yet the field is `pending` — its cells draw
 * the loading block and a view grouped, sorted or filtered by it renders its
 * loading state (data-view) — never "main", which would be a claim about the
 * task that then reverses. A failed read with nothing held is its
 * `readError`; one over a held map keeps painting it. The window is
 * preloaded, so this is at most one round-trip.

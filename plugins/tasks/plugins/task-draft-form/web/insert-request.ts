 * A one-shot request to insert text into an open (or about-to-open) draft form.

 * The `id` — not the text — is the applied-once key, which is what makes this a
 * *request* rather than a seed value. That distinction is load-bearing: a plain
 * `initialText` string silently no-ops when the same snippet is requested twice
 * (React sees an unchanged prop) and re-applies itself on every remount, because
 * the value is indistinguishable from the state it produced.
 *
 * The id is minted here rather than by the caller so two independent callers can
 * never collide, and so "each call is a distinct request" is a property of the
 * type instead of a convention consumers have to keep.

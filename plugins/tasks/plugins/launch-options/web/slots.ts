 *
 * Optional: an option that declares no `pill` still appears on a bar, as its
 * `component`, so adding a launch option never requires editing a host.
 *
 * Nothing new has to be kept in sync with the option's identity: the menu
 * heading and the collapsed placeholder are both the option's existing
 * {@link TaskLaunchOption.label}, and highlighting is **derived by the host**,
 * not declared here — a solo pill tints when its value differs from
 * `def.defaultValue`, and a fused pill never tints.
 *
 * Components rather than an items list on purpose: the host renders one pill
 * per cluster, so a data-shaped descriptor would mean calling each member's
 * hook inside a `.map()` — a rules-of-hooks error. A component per option is
 * one hook scope each, and it keeps a value's own rendering (preprompt's
 * per-row glyph) inside the plugin that owns it.
 *
 * Both components paint the INSIDE of the pill's two holes — the trigger's text
 * and the menu's rows. The pill itself, the headed section around the rows, the
 * muting of a fused pill's later values and the unset state all belong to the
 * host, so an option cannot title its own section differently from its `label`,
 * and the host is the one place the unset state is decided — an option only
 * lends it a word (`unsetLabel`).

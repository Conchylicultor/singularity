/**
 * Both surfaces render the SAME launch-option registry — in two different
 * shapes.
 *
 * The point of the registry is that an option is one plugin folder and shows up
 * on the task detail's Prompt card AND in the task-draft popover with no host
 * edit. A type-check cannot catch a host that silently renders a subset — it
 * still compiles — so it is asserted here.
 *
 * The two hosts draw that one set differently, so each is checked in the shape
 * it really has:
 *
 * - The **task detail's Prompt card** paints a labelled row per option, each
 *   holding the option's own control. One aria-labelled control per option, so
 *   the check is that each appears exactly once.
 * - The **draft popover** paints the options as pills on the composer bar, and
 *   the ones that declared the same `cluster` fuse into a single trigger — the
 *   model and the thinking mode read together as `✦ Opus 5  Auto`. There is
 *   deliberately no longer one control per option on that surface, so the check
 *   is reachability through the new chrome: every expected pill is on the bar,
 *   opening one shows exactly one headed section per option it carries with
 *   selectable rows under each, and the trigger prints every value it holds.
 *
 * That last one is the assertion that earns its keep. A fused member whose
 * value simply vanished while unset is a control the user cannot see and so
 * cannot find — which is exactly how the thinking mode was invisible until it
 * was given a word for its own unset state. So the fused trigger must print
 * both members, with the second in the muted tone.
 *
 * `OPTIONS` below is what keeps this honest. The registry is a web slot, which
 * an `e2e/` script may not import, so the set is *declared* here rather than
 * read back out of the app: a host that dropped an option fails, and so does
 * one that moved an option into a different pill. Only the value strings are
 * imported — from the providers' `core` barrels — so renaming a model or the
 * unset thinking mode moves this script with it instead of reddening it.
 *
 * Drives the draft popover from the task detail's "+ Prerequisite" button
 * rather than the Improve toolbar button: same `TaskDraftPopover`, but a plain
 * always-mounted trigger instead of one behind the floating action bar's
 * hover-disclosure animation.
 *

 * resource in four places, and they did not agree on the direction. It reads
 * newest-first because that is what an attempt list is for: the attempt being
 * worked right now belongs at the top.
 *
 * The join runs as a `select`, so a surface re-renders when ITS OWN task's
 * attempts change rather than on every push to the global list.
 *
 * It hands back the resource STATE, not a list: "still loading" and "this task
 * has never been attempted" are different answers, and a hook that returned an
 * empty array for both would hand every caller the second one during the load
 * window. Each caller narrows it and renders the two its own way — a spinner
 * suits a detail section, nothing at all suits a chip row.

 * conversations across every attempt. Oldest-first, the order they were
 * started: this is a timeline, not a list of current work, which is why it runs
 * the opposite way to {@link useTaskAttempts}. Two names and two stated orders,
 * rather than a coin flip at each call site.
 *
 * Takes a SET of tasks because a surface can have launched several — a prompt
 * block's chips are the runs of every task that block dispatched. A single-task
 * caller passes `[taskId]`.
 *
 * Same two properties as {@link useTaskAttempts}: it runs as a `select`, and it
 * hands back the resource state rather than collapsing "loading" into "none".

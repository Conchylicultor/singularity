// whether it asks for one id or fifty, so per-id reads turn a page read into one
// full-graph round trip per linked task. Built on the same derivations as the
// live `tasks` set (./internal/derived.ts), which reads the base tables instead.
// Today's consumers are `page/annotations/todo/task-link`'s markdown provider
// and `tasks/automations`' open-task lookup (read by the `automations.catalog`
// live value). A legacy live reader of `tasks_v` is reached through the view's

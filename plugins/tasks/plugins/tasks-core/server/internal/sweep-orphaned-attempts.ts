// An attempt with no conversation reads as an active attempt, so the task sits
// at "In progress" forever. Delete it on boot so the task's status is honest.
//
// This is an INVARIANT ALARM, not routine cleanup. A launch creates its attempt
// and its conversation in one transaction (conversations' `commitConversation`),
// so a crash or a throw mid-launch rolls both back and cannot leave one of these.
// Finding one therefore means a write path we cannot explain — it is announced on
// `orphanedAttemptSink`, which conversations maps to a crash report so the bell
// shows it. (A sink, not a direct recordReport: this barrel is loaded by
// drizzle-kit through the tables it exports, and reports/server pulls config_v2,
// which throws at module eval outside a backend.) The task is deliberately NOT re-armed for
// auto-start: that would guess the intent of the unexplained write.

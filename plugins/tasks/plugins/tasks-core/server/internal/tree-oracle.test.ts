/**
 * The TREE ORACLE (P8 v3, steps 18–22; v2 *Verification*): the scripted tree
 * workload (`server/testing/tree-oracle.ts` — tasks, edges, attempts,
 * conversations and pushes: inserts, a rename, a hold, a drag reorder, a
 * poller write, an attempt moved between tasks, cascade deletes, a drop) on a
 * throwaway database through the REAL feed, and after every step each
 * subscribed view, and each persisted key's kept `{}` snapshot, equals a fresh
 * FULL load of its tuple.
 *
 * Step 18 bootstrapped it with a PROBE — an `all` collection over `tasks`
 * with a children aggregate over `attempts` and a base `where`, the shape the
 * conversions take — whose exact per-step costs it pins: an insert is an
 * entrant (one refill, one `orderOf`), a rename an order move, a child write
 * its host's refill, a delete or a drop an exit with no load, and a write to a
 * table the probe does not read loads nothing.
 *
 * Step 19 adds the REAL `tasks` set (`taskRows`, compiled with its shipped
 * serve options against the throwaway), subscribed `{}` and as a `:rows`
 * point reader of two ids, and pins ITS cost per step: a task write is its
 * own row (plus every transitive dependent when the write moves what the
 * blocking rule reads — `held_at`, `dropped_at`), an attempt / conversation /
 * push write is its task's row plus that task's dependents, an edge write the
 * edge's task and its dependents, a write no field reads (the poller's
 * `waiting_for`) nothing. Beside it, `taskDescriptions` (lookup-only,
 * `task-descriptions:rows`) as a point reader of two ids: a description write
 * is its row's refill, a write to any other `tasks` column loads nothing, a
 * deleted id leaves the read. Then the C39 old-bundle check against the real
 * key, with a literal frozen copy of the legacy row.
 *
 * Step 20 adds the REAL `attempts` set (`attemptRows`, its shipped serve
 * options), subscribed `{}` and as a `:rows` point reader of two ids, and
 * pins its cost per step: an attempt write is its own row (an insert an
 * entrant), a conversation write its attempt's (a retitle and a `system`
 * conversation included — the list's route reads `title`, and the rollup
 * reads every kind's `status`), a push its attempt's, a write to a column
 * nothing reads (the poller's `waiting_for` / `last_viewed_at`) nothing, and
 * a task or edge write nothing — C1: no write reaches it as a FULL. Then its
 * own C39 check.
 * Step 22 adds the conversation lists, each compiled with its shipped serve
 * options (`./conversation-rows.ts`): the live `all` sets
 * `conversations-active` and `conversations-system` (subscribed `{}`,
 * persisted), the `conversations-gone` default window, and the
 * `conversations.by-id:rows` point reader of {C1, C2} — C2 done from the
 * seed, the W9 case: a point read finds a done conversation whatever its age.
 * Their cost per step is pinned: a conversation write is a one-row read in
 * each list it could enter or holds it (the poller's `waiting_for` the one
 * set holding the row), a task rename or an attempt move the conversations
 * it owns, and W4 — every other task and attempt write — nothing. Then the
 * C39 checks: `active` / `system` parse under a frozen legacy row, and a tab
 * on the old param-less `conversations-gone` gets `skew`. The gone window
 * is also held at capacity (a `limit: 1` tuple beside the default one): an
 * entrant evicts its tail, a reopen or a delete backfills it, each converged
 * against a fresh FULL at a pinned per-tuple cost.
 * An entry owned downstream of tasks-core runs in
 * its owner's suite: `task-category`'s `task-categories-oracle.test.ts` is
 * step 18's, `agents`' `agent-launches-oracle.test.ts` step 21's.
 *
 * Requires a running Postgres cluster (started by ./singularity build).
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/tasks/plugins/tasks-core`.

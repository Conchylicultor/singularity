// before→after pair around a write. `withTaskStatusChange` (status-scope.ts)
// takes both readings and derives the affected set; this file owns the last two
// steps: the pure before→after diff, and the batch flush that applies it once
// per transaction.

// One `tasks.statusChanged` payload per task whose derived status actually
// moved. Pure — the two maps are read by the caller — which is what makes the
// emission rule testable with no DB.
//
// Two conventions, both older than this function and preserved exactly:
//   - a task absent from `after` is GONE (deleted inside the scope) and emits
//     nothing; there is no transition to report;
//   - a first-time read (`before === null`: the task did not exist, or was not
//     readable, at scope entry) reports `previousStatus = status` rather than
//     lying about a transition. Subscribers that care compare the two fields.

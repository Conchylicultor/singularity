/**
 * The guarantee: `pushes` covers `main` as this backend last observed it.
 *
 * The ledger has two halves, the same shape `infra/corpus-index` uses for
 * file-derived indexes. The PUSH half is the in-process ref reaction — it runs in
 * every backend the instant `refs/heads/main` moves, with nothing queued in
 * between. The PULL half is this: the reads that could otherwise observe an
 * incomplete ledger re-derive it first.
 *
 * The pull half is what makes the push half optional, and that is the point. A
 * reaction that is skipped (backend down), lost (a missed watcher event) or that
 * throws costs latency, never correctness — so the fact does not depend on any
 * background worker's liveness. That dependency is what left landed work reading
 * as unfinished and, through `task_blocking_v`, kept dependent tasks from
 * launching.

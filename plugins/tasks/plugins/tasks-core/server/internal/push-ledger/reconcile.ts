/**
 * The `pushes` ledger as a PROJECTION of `main`'s trailer-bearing history.
 *
 * Every row is derivable from git: `./singularity push` stamps each commit with
 * `Singularity-Conversation` and `Singularity-Push`, and the pre-push
 * `conversation-trailer` check FAILS a push whose commits lack the conversation
 * trailer — so a trailer-bearing commit on `main` is an enforced invariant, not a
 * convention. `main` is only ever fast-forwarded, so its history is a complete
 * record of what landed.
 *
 * That is what makes this a re-derivation rather than an append: running it twice
 * changes nothing, running it late changes nothing but the time, and it needs
 * neither a queue nor a durable job to be correct. See
 * `research/2026-08-18-global-push-ledger-git-projection.md`.
 *
 * This file is the DB-fed orchestration only. The git read (`read-main.ts`), the
 * attribution rules (`plan.ts`) and the walk bound (`walk-bound.ts`) are DB-free
 * so they can be tested directly.

/**
 * Re-derive the ledger from `main`, bounded by a COVERAGE frontier.
 *
 * Two bounds, and the earlier wins: the ledger's own high-water mark minus a day
 * (what a backend that was down for a month must catch up on) and a fixed window
 * back from now (in which a commit this database could not attribute yet is
 * re-offered, because an adoption can make it attributable later). Bounding on
 * insertions alone lost such a commit permanently — `./walk-bound.ts` carries the
 * failure and the horizon policy. The bound is still what keeps this cheap enough
 * to sit on the correctness path rather than in a deferred warm-up: a
 * steady-state run walks a month of commits and inserts nothing, a constant as
 * the repo grows. Only an empty ledger pays for the full history, once.
 *
 * Idempotent at three layers — the sha pre-filter in `planLedger`, `insertPush`'s
 * `onConflictDoNothing`, and the `pushes_sha_unique` index under it. Throws on
 * any git or DB failure; the memo in `freshness.ts` is what turns a throw into
 * "retry on the next read" rather than a half-applied walk cached as settled
 * truth.

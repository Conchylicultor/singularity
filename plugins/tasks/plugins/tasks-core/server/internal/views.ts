// are derived code rebuilt from source on every boot, declared via the `View`
// server contribution (see server/index.ts) + rebuildDerivedViews, never
// tracked in the migration chain. To change a view, edit it here and
// `./singularity build` — no migration is generated. See
// plugins/database/plugins/derived-views/CLAUDE.md.
//
// The view objects stay valid `pgView` relations so the rest of tasks-core can
// keep querying them with `db.select().from(...)`.
//
// The derivations themselves — an attempt's status / active / retained /
// finished_at, a task's per-attempt aggregates and status / active /
// finished_at, the blocking rule — live in `./derived.ts`, written once and
// interpolated here AND by the `tasks` live collection (`./task-rows.ts`),
// which reads the same base tables and rollups without these views. The
// all-parity suite pins the two equal row for row.
//
// The per-attempt aggregates are read from trigger-maintained rollup tables
// (attempt_conv_agg / attempt_push_agg — see rollup-spec.ts) instead of inline
// CTEs grouping ALL conversations + ALL pushes: a flat LEFT JOIN over two small
// pre-rolled tables. A missing rollup row reads as NULL via the LEFT JOIN,
// exactly as a missing CTE group did (preserving the pending / closed / active
// semantics for attempts with no conversations / pushes). tasks_v groups the
// same rollups per task, so neither view reads `conversations` or `pushes`.
// See plugins/database/plugins/derived-tables/CLAUDE.md.

// One attempt's two rollup rows, as `attempts_v` and `tasks_v` LEFT JOIN them.

  // The CASEs are `attemptDerived` (./derived.ts) — the one definition the
  // `tasks` collection reads too. What each arm reads, and why:
  //
  // I6 — EVERY ARM NAMES A FACT THE ROW PROVES. A `pushes` row may only
  // ever PROMOTE an attempt to a landed claim (`pushed` / `completed`); its
  // absence may never select a claim of its own. With no landed evidence the
  // status reports how the SESSION ended — which the conversation rollup does
  // prove — and says nothing about what did or did not land.
  //
  // The last arm used to be `ELSE 'abandoned'`, the one verdict in the whole
  // derivation reached from missing evidence. `has_push IS NULL` means at
  // least four different things — never pushed / finished with nothing to
  // push / landed on a commit carrying no attributable trailer (`--from-main`,
  // a hand-merge) / the ledger has not caught up — and it picked the most
  // damning. 1014 attempts read "Abandoned"; 128 of them sat on a task that
  // was neither dropped nor held.
  //
  // It also swallowed a case that has nothing to do with pushes at all:
  // hibernation writes `gone` on an idle pane, `gone` is not live but IS open
  // (and is exactly the status `resumeConversation` requires), so a live,
  // resumable attempt that had not pushed yet fell through to `abandoned`.
  // `has_open_conv` is what tells the two apart (`dormant`).
  //
  // Ordering: `dormant` sits BELOW the landed arms on purpose. It exists to
  // stop ABSENCE reading as abandonment, not to outrank a true claim — when
  // there is evidence, the evidence wins.
  //
  // Consequence, and the reason this is the view-layer twin of attempt-work's
  // I3: `attempts_v.status` can no longer contradict `standingOf`. The only
  // landed-claiming arm is backed by the very rows `standingOf` ORs into
  // "landed", and no arm claims "nothing landed" at all. See
  // research/2026-08-20-tasks-attempt-status-positive-evidence.md.
  //
  // `active` — PROGRESS: "an agent is expected to be running on this
  // attempt". Reads has_live_conv (`status NOT IN ('gone','done')`), so a
  // conversation whose process vanished reads inactive — the right answer for
  // the task list's in_progress / need_action / blocked badges. NOT A
  // RETENTION SIGNAL: never gate a destructive action on it — a `gone`
  // conversation is dormant, not finished.
  //
  // `retained` — RETENTION: "the user has not finished with this attempt, so
  // its worktree and fork DB are still theirs". Reads has_open_conv
  // (`status <> 'done'`), matching `isActiveStatus()` and
  // `conversations_v.active`. An attempt with no conversation yet is retained.
  // THIS is the guard every destructive consumer must read (worktree-cleanup's
  // reaper does). Gating deletion on `active` instead is what deleted the
  // checkouts of 22 live conversations.
  //
  // `finishedAt` — EXACTLY the two statuses that are over carry a finish
  // instant: `completed` (first arm) and `closed` (second). `has_conv` on the
  // first arm keeps `pending` out; `NOT has_open_conv` on the second keeps
  // `dormant` out. views.test.ts asserts the equivalence over the whole status
  // truth table.

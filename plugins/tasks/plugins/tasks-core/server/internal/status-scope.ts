// THE chokepoint for a write that can change a task's derived status. The write
// happens INSIDE the recorder, so there is no "afterwards" to forget, no
// ordering to get wrong, and no `previous` parameter to supply stalely — the
// primitive reads it. And the affected set is DERIVED from the graph rather than
// named by the caller, which is the defect this replaces: an edge write can only
// ever name its own endpoint, never the downstream tasks whose derived status it
// just changed. (Design:
// research/2026-08-18-global-task-launch-woken-by-db-change-v2.md.)
//
// ─── The closure rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// For a write recorded against `T`, the tasks whose status can change are
// exactly `{T} ∪ transitiveDependents(T)`. Read the `tasks_v` status CASE
// (views.ts): a task's status is a function of its own dropped_at/held_at, its
// own attempts/conversations/pushes, and `task_blocking_v.has_blocking_dep` —
// which is a function of its transitive ANCESTORS' settledness, never of their
// blocked-ness. Influence flows downstream only, and the graph is acyclic
// (`taskDependsOn` bars cycles on insert), so the walk never re-enters.
//
// ─── Why an edge write is safe to BRACKET (the closure is read once) ─────────
//
// Writing the edge `A → B` does not change `dependents(A)`, so the closure is
// identical before and after the write and may be read either side of it. The
// dependents walk from `A` traverses an edge only if that edge's `depends_on`
// endpoint is already visited; this edge's `depends_on` endpoint is `B`; `B = A`
// is rejected by the self-check, and `B ∈ dependents(A)` would be a cycle —
// rejected on insert, and impossible for a REMOVAL in an already-acyclic
// graph. ∎
//
// ─── Why the entry status is recorded BEFORE the write, not at flush ─────────
//
// Flush-time expansion of the closure would be set-correct but status-INCORRECT:
// a task first entering the closure at flush has no recoverable batch-entry
// status, and `previousStatus` is load-bearing (the queue's rerank consumer keys
// on the blocked↔unblocked transition). Record-time is correct by induction: `T`
// is inserted into `batch.before` by the FIRST write whose closure contains it,
// and every earlier write had `T` outside its closure and so — by the closure
// rule above — could not have changed `T`'s status. So `T`'s recorded status IS
// its status at batch entry, and earliest-wins on the map is what makes that the
// reading that lands. ∎

// attempt's status / active / retained / finished_at from its two rollup rows,
// a task's per-attempt facts (the aggregates over its attempts), a task's
// status / active / finished_at from those facts, and the rule for "this
// dependency still blocks what depends on it".
//
// Two readers interpolate them, and they must never disagree:
//
//  - the derived views (`views.ts`: `attempts_v`, `task_blocking_v`,
//    `tasks_v`), over drizzle columns and CTE columns; and
//  - the `tasks` live collection (`task-rows.ts`), over the `all` compiler's
//    refs — a nested rollup's columns, a children / closure join's aggregates.
//
// Each builder takes the facts it reads as operands (anything drizzle's `sql`
// interpolates as a value) and returns fresh SQL per call, so a caller may
// `.mapWith` / `.as` its result without touching another caller's. The
// all-parity suite pins the two readers equal row for row.

 * precedence over `need_action` / `in_progress` — a blocked task must read as
 * blocked wherever it is shown — but reports `in_progress_blocked` so the live
 * attempt is not hidden behind it. Anything asking "is this blocked?" reads

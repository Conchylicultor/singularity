/**
 * The push accessors whose EMPTINESS a consumer could misread, each guaranteed
 * to see a ledger that covers `main` before it reads.
 *
 * `pushes` is a projection of `main`'s trailer-bearing history, not the output of
 * a background job (see ../push-ledger/). Putting the guarantee inside the reader
 * is what keeps it from being a rule every future consumer has to remember: there
 * is no accessor on the barrel that can hand back a ledger that has not caught
 * up. The ungated reads the projection itself needs live in
 * ../push-ledger/raw-reads.ts and are not exported from the plugin.
 *
 * The guarantee is about COMPLETENESS. Interpretation is still governed by I3
 * (`tasks/attempt-work/CLAUDE.md`): a row proves a push happened, and even a
 * complete ledger cannot see a commit that carries no trailer, so its absence
 * still may not be read as proof that nothing landed.

 * The whole table, for `pushesResource` — the server-side cascade carrier that

/**
 * Real-DB invariant suite for the monotone membership label (`tasks.cluster_id`)
 * — design: `research/2026-08-03-tasks-monotone-deps-tree-membership.md`.
 *
 * Two harnesses, deliberately, because the two halves need opposite things:
 *
 *  - **`describe("unionTaskClusters")`** drives the union primitive against a
 *    THROWAWAY database (`db-test-fixture` + the real migration chain).
 *    `unionTaskClusters` touches only the `tasks` base table, so migrations are
 *    the whole schema it needs — and a throwaway DB is the only way to get two
 *    genuinely concurrent COMMITTED transactions, which the lost-update test at
 *    the bottom requires. The fixture's own pool is `max: 1`, so two extra
 *    single-connection handles are opened (the `page-forest.test.ts` pattern).
 *
 *  - **`describe("union points")`** drives the callers (`addTaskDependency`,
 *    `createTask`, `updateTask`) against the REAL worktree DB inside a
 *    transaction we roll back. Those read the `tasks_v` view for their status
 *    snapshot, and only the real boot builds the derived-view layer — a
 *    migrations-only throwaway cannot reproduce it (same constraint
 *    `deps-tree-move.test.ts` documents). Each takes an `exec`, so the whole
 *    scenario joins our transaction and nothing lands in the worktree DB.
 *
 * Run: `bun test plugins/tasks/plugins/tasks-core/server/internal/mutations/clusters.test.ts`
 * (requires the running embedded cluster — `./singularity build` first).

  // from the pre-T1 snapshot. Its UPDATE then blocks on B, re-evaluates after
  // T1 commits, finds B no longer NULL, and writes only C — stranding C on
  // label B, which nobody else carries. That is the reported bug in a form no
  // edge removal explains, and both transactions commit cleanly, so nothing
  // else would ever surface it.
  //
  // WITH the lock, T2's SELECT blocks on B, re-reads it as A after T1 commits,
  // and computes min(A,C)=A. All three land on A.
  //
  // VERIFIED NON-VACUOUS — do not take this on faith, it was measured. A
  // concurrency test that never forces the overlap passes against a broken
  // implementation too, so this interleaving was run against a copy of
  // `unionTaskClusters` with `.for("update")` removed: C ended up labelled B
  // while A and B were labelled A — two clusters, C stranded on a label nobody

  // that leaves the interleaving to chance and the test proves nothing.

/**
 * The task tree is LIVE end to end (P8 v3, steps 18–22; v2 *Verification* →
 * `tree-live-verify`): rows written straight into the deploy's database reach
 * an open Tasks pane over the socket, as scoped deltas, with no HTTP read of
 * the tree's live resources after first paint and no page reload — and a
 * reload's first paint is already current (the boot snapshot).
 *
 * Each conversion step adds its phase here. Landed:
 *
 *  - **18 `task-categories`** — a category set on a seeded task arrives as one
 *    upsert, a change as one upsert, a clear as one delete (checked on the
 *    socket's frames, not in the DOM). A reload's boot snapshot carries the
 *    current set.
 *
 *  - **19 `tasks`** — a second seeded task arrives as an entrant (one upsert),
 *    a hold and a release of the first each as one upsert of its row with the
 *    new status, an edge making the second run after the first as one upsert
 *    of the second (`dependencies`, `blocked`), the edge's removal likewise,
 *    and the second task's delete as one delete. A reload's boot snapshot
 *    carries the first task.
 *
 *  - **20 `attempts`** — an attempt on the seeded task arrives as an entrant
 *    (`pending`, no conversations) and moves the task to `in_progress` (an
 *    attempt with no conversation yet is `active`: its agent is expected); a
 *    conversation of it as one upsert of the attempt (`closed`, the
 *    conversation listed); a retitle as one upsert carrying the new title; a
 *    push as one upsert of the
 *    attempt (`completed`) and of the task (`done`); the attempt's delete as a
 *    delete, and the task back to `new`. The page is the task's detail pane,
 *    whose attempt sections read the set.
 *
 *    What a write no field reads (the poller's `waiting_for` /
 *    `last_viewed_at`) costs is NOT checked here: the runtime diffs a refill
 *    against the kept rows and sends no frame for an identical row, so a
 *    wasted refill is invisible on the socket. The tree oracle pins it
 *    (`conversation.poller`: no load on `attempts`), counting loads.
 *
 *  - **21 `agent-launches`** — a launch of a seeded agent on the seeded task
 *    arrives as an entrant (no latest conversation); an attempt with a
 *    `working` conversation as one upsert of the launch carrying it; the
 *    conversation's close as one upsert (`done`); the attempt's delete (its
 *    conversation cascades) as one upsert back to no latest conversation —
 *    W8, which the boot reconcile alone used to heal; the launch's delete as
 *    a delete. The phase opens the seeded agent's detail pane on a page of
 *    its own, whose status dot and Attempts list read the set for as long as
 *    it is open.
 *
 *  - **22 the conversation lists** — W9: a page opened on a done
 *    conversation older than the newest 30 ended ones resolves it from the
 *    `conversations.by-id` read, with no REST call. A new conversation arrives
 *    as an entrant of `conversations-active`, a poller's `waiting_for` and a
 *    rename of its task (`taskTitle`) each as one upsert, its close as a
 *    delete from the active set and an entrant of the gone window, its delete
 *    as a delete from the window; no list or by-id read goes over HTTP.
 *    Then the by-id pane's boot cost is pinned: a reloaded active
 *    conversation's pane paints only after its by-id answer (lookup-only
 *    reads are never in the boot snapshot), with the latency reported.
 *
 * Seeds go straight into the deploy's database (out of band, so anything that
 * arrives came off the server), are reactor-inert (`title_auto = false`; the
 * attempt has a nonexistent worktree, its one conversation is `done`, and
 * nothing runs the code paths that emit `pushes.landed` or
 * `tasks.statusChanged`) and are deleted at the end (also on failure).
 * Refuses main.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

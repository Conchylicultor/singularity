Before debugging, read the \`debug\` skill (\`.claude/skills/debug/SKILL.md\`) — the map of logs, profiling, slow-ops, crashes and DB surfaces.

1. Find the root cause. Reproduce it if you can, and quote the evidence (log lines, trace, query) that pins it.
2. Fix the cause, not the symptom — take the highest rung of the fix ladder in CLAUDE.md.
3. Run \`./singularity build\` and confirm the reports stop recurring.
4. If you cannot find or fix the cause, write up what you learned and raise a flag.

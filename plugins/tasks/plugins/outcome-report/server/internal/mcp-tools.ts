- **Problem** — what was wrong or missing, and why we care.
- **Before → after** — the mental model before the change and after it.
- **What changed** — the change itself, in plain words (files only where they help).
- **Caveats** — anything you ran into, left out, or are unsure about.

If the work needs ONE decision from the user (a design choice, a risky change you did not push), put it in \`question\` with up to six short one-click \`answers\`; the user's choice arrives as your next message. Otherwise make the call yourself and leave \`question\` out.

Calling it again replaces the earlier report. Do not close the conversation (no \`exit_clean\`): it stays open for the user to review.`,

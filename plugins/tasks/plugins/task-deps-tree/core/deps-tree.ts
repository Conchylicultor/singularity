 * Project the shared cluster (see {@link taskClusterIds}) as a dependency TREE.
 *
 * Every `task_dependencies` edge inside the cluster becomes a literal tree edge:
 * a task nests under its primary parent (the oldest edge in `dependencies`, which
 * `tasks_v` already orders by edge `createdAt`); any further in-cluster
 * prerequisites fan in as `extraDeps` chips. Members with no in-cluster
 * dependency — including tasks pulled in only by creation edges — render as
 * top-level roots. Settled tasks stay in rows (muted at render).
 *
 * `memberIds` is the exact set of rows to emit; the caller computes it once and
 * feeds the SAME set to the creation tree, so both views show one set two ways.

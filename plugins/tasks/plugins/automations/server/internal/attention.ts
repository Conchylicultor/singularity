 *   only started): only `attempted` while it still holds its slot — its agent
 *   went away without reporting. Its agent leaves the person a report instead
 *   (whose own surface asks for them), so `need_action` — which it passes
 *   through at every turn's end, a build wait included — would only be noise;
 *   `held` was a person's own act; and once released, closing its

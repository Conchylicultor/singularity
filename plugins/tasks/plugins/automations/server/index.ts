    "Automations registry: defineAutomation declares something that files a task and launches its agent on its own (file kind) or launches agents on existing tasks a few at a time (launch kind: candidates, concurrency slots held until a task settles or releaseLaunchedTask), and owns its job (automation.<id>) — its config document (defineAutomationConfig: enabled, push policy, model, excluded sources, trigger — a schedule re-installed live on change, or an event whose bursts settle into one run — and the prompt template), the one-open-task dedupe, the filled prompt, the filing (task + category + tasks_ext_origin row in one transaction) and the armed launch. Serves the automations.catalog value and the automations.tasks collection (the origin side-table), and notifies the bell when an automated task needs its person.",

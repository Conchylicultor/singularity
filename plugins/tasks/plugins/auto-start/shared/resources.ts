// task's marker), minting `tasks-auto-start:rows` alone. A reader asks with
// `useLiveRow(taskAutoStart, taskId)`, and `found: false` is "not armed".
//
// Every consumer asks about ONE task and needs an exact answer — the launch
// option's select control both reads and writes this row — so a point read is
// the right bound rather than a window, which could silently render an armed
// task as "Off". Subscribers name the task they render: a task row asks for its
// own id, the open task's Prompt card for that task's id. The `:rows` point
// routing sends an arm/disarm to a tuple iff the changed ids intersect its set,
// so arming one task never sweeps the table.
//
// NOT preloaded (a lookup-only collection cannot be): it hydrates post-mount
// via its sub-ack.
//
// **The row id is `taskId`, the table's primary key**: the point membership
// intersects the ids a write touched — PK values — with each reader's id set.
// Served from the extension handle in `server/internal/resource.ts`.

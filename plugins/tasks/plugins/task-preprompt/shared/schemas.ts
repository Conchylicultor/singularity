// `parent_id`) — so it is a lookup-only collection: no default window (nothing
// lists every task's selection), minting `task-preprompts:rows` alone. A reader
// asks with `useLiveRow(taskPreprompts, taskId)`, and `found: false` is "none
// selected".
//
// Every consumer asks about ONE task and needs an exact answer — the launch
// option's picker both reads and writes this row — so a point read is the
// right bound rather than a window, which could silently render a selected
// preprompt as "None". The `:rows` point routing sends a write to a tuple iff
// the changed ids intersect its set, so selecting one task's preprompt never
// sweeps the table.
//
// NOT preloaded (a lookup-only collection cannot be): it hydrates post-mount
// via its sub-ack. Served from the extension handle in
// `server/internal/resource.ts`.

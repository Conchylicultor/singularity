/**
 * The git reads behind an attempt's standing. Deliberately DB-free: every
 * function here takes the paths, refs and ids it needs, so the measurement is
 * exercisable against a throwaway repo (`measure.test.ts`) with no database and no
 * plugin runtime. The DB-fed orchestration (which attempt, which conversations,
 * the memo) lives in `work.ts`.
 *
 * `readBranch` / `readMergeBase` / `readDeltaCounts` / `probeHeadMain` are lifted
 * from `commits-graph`'s `compute-graph.ts` — same semantics, same reasoning; the
 * `rev` parameter is new and defaults to `HEAD`, so a worktree-side caller reads
 * exactly as before while a reaped attempt can be measured through its branch ref.

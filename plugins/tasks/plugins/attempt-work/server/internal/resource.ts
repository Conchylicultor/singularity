// sync-to-head, or main moving) changes the standing of every visible attempt —
// so `recomputeOn: [refHeadServed]` recomputes every subscribed attempt.
// git-watcher only tracks `main` + this worktree's own branch, so a notify
// already implies a relevant ref moved — no need to inspect the refName.
//
// There is deliberately NO `pushesResource` dependency. The landed set is now
// git-measured, so a ref advance is the COMPLETE refresh signal; the ledger only
// corroborates, and its own arrival moves the signature (see `attemptWorkEtag`)
// so a push row landing without a ref advance still invalidates on the next read.

  // unmeasurable standing — an attempt row that no longer exists. Every real git

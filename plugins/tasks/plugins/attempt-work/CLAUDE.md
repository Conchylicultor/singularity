# attempt-work

One authority for a single question: **where does this attempt stand relative to
`main`?** The answer is measured from git — how far the attempt's branch is ahead
of `main`, plus which of `main`'s commits carry this attempt's conversation
trailers — and it is the fact every "is it safe to drop this?" decision reads.

It lives under `plugins/tasks/` rather than inside `commits-graph` (a chip-and-pane
plugin) because the server-side exit-drop guard needs it and because the standing
is a task-domain fact. Dependency direction: `tasks-core` ← `attempt-work` ←
{`commits-graph`, `push-and-exit`, `drop-and-exit`}. `tasks-core` never imports it,
so there is no cycle.

## Why not the `pushes` table

The `pushes` table was an **event ledger**, written by a `tasks.push-ingest` job
reacting to `git.refAdvanced`. When that job lagged — it was observed 40+ minutes
behind a wedged queue — the table was empty for work that is fully merged into
`main`. So `pushes.length === 0` conflated two different facts: *"nothing was
pushed"* and *"nothing has been ingested yet"*. Read as the former, it offered
**Drop & Close** over landed work, and `maybeDropTaskOnExit` actually performed the
drop.

That lag is now closed at the source: the ledger is a projection of `main`,
re-derived in-process on every ref advance and guaranteed on read (I5,
`tasks/tasks-core/CLAUDE.md`,
`research/2026-08-18-global-push-ledger-git-projection.md`). **This plugin still
does not read it as an authority**, and the reason is no longer freshness — it is
that the ledger answers a different question. It records what LANDED; the standing
also has to account for commits that have not been pushed yet (D2), which no row
in that table will ever describe. A complete ledger also still cannot see a commit
that carries no trailer. So I3 below stands unchanged.

Git has no such lag. Every commit that lands via `./singularity push` carries
`Singularity-Conversation: <convId>` and `Singularity-Push: <uuid>`, and the
pre-push `conversation-trailer` check *fails the push* when a commit lacks the
conversation trailer — so this is an enforced invariant, not a convention. `main`
is only ever fast-forwarded, so its history is a complete record of what landed.
Full design: `research/2026-08-17-global-attempt-work-git-derived-standing.md`.

## I3 — a ledger row is positive evidence only

`AttemptWork.ledgerPushes` is still read from `pushes`, and that is deliberate: a
row **proves** a push happened, which is what keeps a pre-trailer-era attempt (its
commits carry no trailer to grep for) from reading as droppable. But it may only
ever be **ORed into** a positive answer — see `standingOf` — and never used to
conclude a negative one. Its absence proves nothing at all.

Anything new that wants to know whether an attempt has work at stake reads
`getAttemptWork` / `attemptWorkResource`, not the ledger. What stays on the ledger
is everything that is *about one specific recorded push* (`task-events`,
`push-profiling`, the per-push diff, the review pane, the `pushes.landed` trigger)
— those are display-only or self-healing.

`attempts_v.status` also reads the ledger, and now holds the same discipline: I6
(`tasks-core/CLAUDE.md`) makes every arm a fact the row proves, so no status claims
"nothing landed" and none can contradict `standingOf`. The badge and this plugin's
buttons agree by construction rather than by coincidence.

## I4 — the standing is a discriminated value, not a count

`standingOf(work)` returns `"none" | "pending" | "landed"`, and it is the **only**
place any of these counts is compared to zero. Decision sites `switch` on the
result, exhaustively, so a new arm becomes a `tsc` error rather than a silently
mishandled case. There is no array at a decision site whose emptiness can be
misread, and the destructive branch is reachable only from a measured `"none"`.

`"pending"` wins over `"landed"`: unpushed commits are the actionable state, so an
attempt with both still asks for a push.

## `no-branch` is an answer, not a failure

`AttemptPending` has two arms. `measured` carries `ahead` / `behind` /
`mergeBase` / `branch`. `no-branch` means the branch ref does not exist — and that
is a **determinate** answer: with no ref, no unpushed commit of this attempt can
survive to be lost, so `standingOf` may safely treat it as "nothing pending". It is
not a stand-in for a read that failed.

Everything that could make the standing merely *unknown* is kept out of that arm:

- A **reaped worktree** is not `no-branch`. `git worktree remove` does not delete
  the branch, so `refs/heads/claude-web/<attemptId>` (from
  `attemptBranchName`, the one definition of the convention) is still measurable
  from the main repo — and `landed` was always measurable there. This is why the
  resource does *not* collapse a missing worktree onto `unresolved`, the way
  `commits-graph` does.
- A **real git failure throws**. `refExists` distinguishes a clean "no such ref"
  (`rev-parse --verify --quiet` exiting 1) from every other non-zero exit, and
  `readMergeBase` / `readDeltaCounts` / `readLanded` propagate. A throw aborts the
  memo recompute and retains the previous entry; it never manufactures `ahead: 0`
  or an empty landed set.
- **Genuinely unmeasurable** is the payload's `Resolvable` unresolved arm — an
  attempt row that no longer exists. Consumers route that to the non-destructive
  action, exactly as they already do for an errored or never-loaded resource.

## Shape

- `core/protocol.ts` — the wire payload (`AttemptWork`, wrapped in `Resolvable`).
- `core/standing.ts` — `standingOf`, the decision layer.
- The reader half of the trailer grammar (key names, the `git log --format=`
  fragment, `parseTrailerLog`) lives in `tasks-core/core`, with the `pushes` table
  it fills, and is imported from there — so the format string, its parse, and the
  ledger's own projection have one home. The writer half (the shell hook, the push
  CLI) keeps its literals, bound to these readers by the `conversation-trailer`
  check.
- `server/internal/measure.ts` — the git reads, deliberately **DB-free** so
  `measure.test.ts` can reproduce each behaviour against a throwaway repo with no
  database and no plugin runtime. `commits-graph` shares these helpers rather than
  keeping its own copies.
- `server/internal/work.ts` — the DB-fed orchestration behind one
  `createSignedMemo`, so the resource's `revalidate` and its `loader` are provably
  the same authority over the same inputs
  (`research/2026-07-09-global-etag-value-coproduction.md`). The signature folds in
  both tips, the conversation set (it grows while an attempt runs) and the ledger
  count (a push row can land with no local ref moving).
- `server/internal/resource.ts` — `attemptWorkResource`, `mode: "push"`, refreshed
  by `refHeadResource` alone. There is deliberately no `pushesResource`
  dependency: now that the landed set is git-measured, a ref advance is the
  complete refresh signal.

// File a task with its launch options, and start it now — the operation the
// auto-start queue performs, invoked inline instead of from a job. So a launch
// always has its task up front, carrying the options it was launched with
// (preprompt, thinking mode, model), instead of an implicit "Untitled" task
// minted afterwards with none.
//
// Why the options are applied with `start: "now"`: auto-start's apply would
// otherwise ARM the task, which enqueues `tasks.maybe-launch` — and that job,
// running in this process's own worker, would race the claim below for the same
// marker. The claim is exactly-once, so if the job won we would have launched a
// conversation and have none to return. With `now`, the apply only records the
// model on the marker, and the claim below is the only runner.
//
// Two transactions, deliberately: the task and its options commit before the
// launch claims. A crash in between leaves a filed task still carrying its
// marker, so on main the boot reconcile finishes the launch the user asked for;
// with auto-start Off there is no marker and it stays a filed, unstarted task —
// a normal, visible state.

# backup

## The backup runs OUT OF PROCESS

`backup.run.supervised` is a `defineSupervisedJob`: it claims the ledger row,
spawns `./singularity supervised-exec backup.run.supervised` **detached**, and
suspends. So a backend restart mid-`tar` no longer kills the backup — the child
outlives it and whichever backend is up when the exit marker lands records the
outcome. The body is the job's `run` (`backup-body.ts`), which the child calls;
the job keeps its own ledger (`backup_runs`), which the child writes itself.

Three consequences that look like bugs and are not:

- **`reconcileBackups` writes to no table.** Its old second arm marked every
  unfinished row failed at boot, which would now kill the very backup that
  survived the restart. Closing rows is `closeBackupRow`, driven by the child's
  own exit marker. The filesystem sweep it still does is skipped entirely while
  a backup's pid is alive, for the same reason.
- **The cron is on the job itself** (`schedule` on `backup.run.supervised`, so
  it is `dedup: "singleton"`: one pending row, and a manual enqueue landing on a
  pending tick's row takes its payload). A run's identity is its queue row, so a
  scheduled supervised job cannot replay an earlier run's steps. A tick that
  fires while a backup is running loses the claim and returns.
- **`backup_runs.namespace` exists but the runs arm still reports `null`.** The
  column scopes `listUnfinished` (a worktree DB is a fork of main's and inherits
  its rows) and gives the in-flight unique index something to contend on. It is
  not a claim that a backup belongs to a worktree; a backup is host-global.
- **`runAttempts: 2` is not the odd one out by accident.** Every other supervised
  kind keeps the default 1; backup's old job carried `maxAttempts: 2`, so this
  preserves what it had. A backup's likeliest failure is the upload leg, and the
  fallback is the nightly schedule — one blip would otherwise cost a whole day.

Overlap is prevented by `backup_runs_inflight_uniq`, not by the queue: the
claiming INSERT is the lock. The run directory is named for the second the
assembly started, so `assembleArchive` creates it non-recursively and fails loud
on `EEXIST` rather than letting two runs share a staging tree and an archive
path — unreachable today, silent corruption if it ever is not.

## A source that fails costs the archive that source, and nothing else

Every source is assembled on its own and a thrower is recorded, not propagated.
`assembleArchive` runs each `BackupSource.assemble` inside its own `try`, and a
source that throws becomes a `failed` report in the manifest carrying its own
words; `assembleDatabases` does the same one level down, per database.

This is not a nicety. Both layers used to be a bare `Promise.all`, so ONE
rejection took the whole run: on 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-19 a composition
database that had not booted since the migration dropping
`mail_drafts.thread_id` still carried the constraint, the exclusion planner
rightly refused to dump it, and the machine went three nights with no archive at
all — no attachments, no secrets, no transcripts — because of a database holding
zero rows. The cluster will always hold databases this repo's schema does not
describe (dormant composition forks, leaked test databases), so this is a
standing condition, not an incident.

Three rules hold it together:

- **A source's outcome is a union, not a `skipped` boolean.** `included` /
  `skipped` / `failed` (`backup/core`), so a consumer cannot render a failed
  source as a fine one by forgetting an optional field. `failed` still carries
  `items` and `sizeBytes`, because a source can fail PART way and what it wrote
  is really in the archive.
- **A failed source keeps the run off `ok`.** `backup-body` folds source
  failures into the status beside the target tally. Before, the status came from
  targets alone, so a run whose databases source blew up and whose uploads then
  went fine recorded `ok`.
- **A partial dump is deleted, never archived.** A killed `pg_dump` leaves a
  truncated custom-format file that `pg_restore` only discovers is short while
  someone is restoring it. `assembleDatabases` reclaims it on the error path, so
  the archive holds a whole dump or no file.

Manifests are **v3**. v2 rows (`skipped: boolean`) are still read — the boolean
maps onto `included` / `skipped` losslessly, since v2 had no way to say `failed`
— by both decoders and by the runs arm's `sourceCountExpr`. `backupSourceWentIn`
in `backup/core` is the one reading of "did this source put anything in the
archive", so the list and the count cannot disagree.

## The gap now reaches the alert funnel

A run that does not end `ok` files a **`backup-incomplete`** report. It did not
before, and that was the bug behind the bug: three nights of failure showed up
only in the backup pane, so the way anyone found out was by going and looking.

The child writes it through the **outbox** (`reports/plugins/outbox`), not
`recordReport`. It does hold a database connection, but the reports engine is
more than a row — its velocity window, fan-out ceiling and shed buffer are
per-process in-memory state, and a process that exits seconds later would dedupe
against nothing. The kind is registered by `backup/server` so MAIN's drain can
resolve it.

It dedupes on WHAT is missing rather than on the run, so a standing gap is one
row with a rising count and a new source starting to fail mints its own.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Backup orchestrator UI: run backups, view history, and open one run's detail pane — whose sections (what went into the archive, where it was dispatched to, and the Grant access repair for a target that lost its OAuth token) are contributed by the backup arm. Backup orchestrator: assembles archives from registered backup sources, dispatches to registered storage targets. The assembly runs OUT OF PROCESS as a supervised job's `run` body, so a backend restart mid-`tar` no longer kills the backup.

  - **`runs-arm`** — The backup arm's presence on the merged run surface: the kind's label, its rows' activation into the backup run-detail pane, its four scalar columns (native status, archive size, source and target counts) as real filterable and sortable SQL dimensions, and the three detail sections — the archive's size on one line, the manifest's source reports, and the per-target outcome with its Grant access remediation. The backup arm of the unified run space: binds backup_runs into the runs union — its native status folded into the shared outcome vocabulary (partial included, since backup is the only kind that can half-succeed), a label naming what the run covered, and the source / target counts plus the raw per-target results as its own columns. Reads null for namespace (a backup covers the machine, not a checkout — the table's own namespace column is the in-flight index's scope discriminator, not a fact about the run) and for message (a backup's failure words are per-target).
  - **`sources`** — Umbrella for pluggable backup sources, each a self-gating sub-plugin contributing a BackupSource.
    - Plugins:
      - **`attachments`** — Config UI for the attachments backup source. Backs up file attachments into the backup archive.
      - **`claude-settings`** — Config UI for the Claude settings backup source. Backs up Claude CLI settings and history into the backup archive.
      - **`config`** — Config UI for the config backup source. Backs up Singularity config files into the backup archive.
      - **`cost-history`** — Config UI for the cost-history backup source. Backs up the permanent cost-history archive (year-sharded session records and the merged price table) into the backup archive.
      - **`databases`** — Config UI for the databases backup source. Backs up worktree databases into the backup archive.
      - **`project-memory`** — Config UI for the project memory backup source. Backs up Claude Code project memory files into the backup archive.
      - **`prototypes`** — Config UI for the prototypes backup source. Backs up the throwaway UI prototypes into the backup archive — they live outside git on purpose, so this is what makes them recoverable.
      - **`secrets`** — Config UI for the secrets backup source. Backs up encrypted secrets into the backup archive.
      - **`singularity-platform`** — Config UI for the Singularity platform backup source. Backs up Singularity platform files (auth, database config) into the backup archive.

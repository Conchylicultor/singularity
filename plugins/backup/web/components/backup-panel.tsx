    // cards that used to be here; it matters the moment a rail follower is.

    // table of six columns does not, and 42rem is where its cells stop being

          share and start showing builds the moment someone clicked that tab over
          there. Pinning also drops the switcher, which is right — inside the
          Backup app this is one scoped list, not a tab strip over every ledger.

          The hand-rolled expand/collapse cards that used to live here are gone,
          and so is the disclosure row that replaced them: a run's detail is now
          a pane of its own, which is what lets the row be an ordinary
          field-driven line that obeys the Properties panel. A new backup
          arrives through `runs.revision` rather than through this panel
          re-fetching a list of its own. */}

/**
 * Hard wall-clock ceiling on the `tar` below.
 *
 * It replaces the job's `ctx.signal`, which is gone with the in-process job: the
 * body runs in a detached child now, and there is no job deadline in a child to
 * abort anything. Passing a signal that never fires would have been worse than
 * passing none — a bound in the type that is not a bound at runtime.
 *
 * One hour, which is the ceiling this `tar` already had: the old job was
 * `hold: "minutes"`, whose `deadlineMs` is 3,600,000 ms, and that deadline
 * aborting `ctx.signal` was the only thing that ever stopped it. So this is the
 * same number, moved to where it is now knowable, and not a new policy.
 *
 * Not a target. A healthy archive of this machine is minutes; only a wedge —
 * a stalled network filesystem under the staging dir — reaches an hour, and at
 * that point the run has to end so its `.partial` can be reclaimed and the
 * in-flight lock released.

/**
 * The backup itself: the `run` body of `backupRunJob`, executed in its own
 * process (`./singularity supervised-exec backup.run.supervised`).
 *
 * A backup is ~11 contributed sources staged into a directory, one `tar`, and
 * ~2 contributed targets — there is no command line to type, so before it ran
 * out of process it was an in-process job handler and a backend restart killed
 * it mid-`tar`. The child boots the plugin graph in `exec` mode, which is what
 * makes `BackupSource` / `BackupTarget` contributions and the config registry
 * present here exactly as they are in the backend. Nothing is passed in but the
 * run id and what triggered it.
 *
 * **This row is claimed before the child exists** (`claimBackupRun`, in the
 * job's ledger `claim`), so everything here is an UPDATE. The final update — the
 * one that writes `finished_at` — is the last act of the run, which is what
 * makes a still-open row at exit unambiguously mean "the process died without
 * recording anything" (see `closeBackupRow`).

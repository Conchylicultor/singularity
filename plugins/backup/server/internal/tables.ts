    //     unscoped `listUnfinished` would hand every worktree's supervised-run

    //     does not exist there, and to close with an outcome nobody observed;
    //   - the partial unique index below needs a column to contend on, and
    //     "one in flight per namespace" is exactly today's behaviour (the job
    //     was `dedup: "singleton"`, which is per-database and therefore already
    //     per-namespace).

    // In practice nearly always `MAIN_WORKTREE_NAME` — the schedule is main-only

    // exactly why the scope has to be real rather than assumed. Backfills to the
    // same value, since every historical row was claimed on main.

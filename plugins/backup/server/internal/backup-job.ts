/**
 * One backup, as an ordinary durable job whose body runs in its own process.
 *
 * The handler claims this namespace's single in-flight slot, spawns
 * `./singularity supervised-exec backup.run.supervised` detached, and SUSPENDS — it holds a
 * worker slot for milliseconds, not for the length of a `pg_dump` fan-out plus a
 * `tar` plus a Drive upload. Whichever backend is alive when the child's exit
 * marker lands is the one that wakes and records the outcome.
 *
 * **This is what makes a backup survive a restart**, which it never did before:
 * the work is no longer inside the process the deploy, the sleep or the crash
 * takes down. The old boot-time "mark every unfinished row failed" sweep is
 * gone with it — after this change, an unfinished row at boot usually means a
 * backup that is still running.
 *
 * `runAttempts: 2` **preserves what this job already had**, and is not an opt-in
 * to something new: the old `defineJob` carried `maxAttempts: 2`, whose retry
 * re-ran the whole handler body — assemble from scratch, upload from scratch —
 * which is exactly what a second spawn does. The default is 1 everywhere else
 * because build, release and deploy never retried; backup did.
 *
 * It also earns its keep here in a way it would not for the others. A backup's
 * likeliest failure is the upload leg, a network blip reaching Drive, which is
 * the transient class a retry is for — and the fallback if we dropped it is the
 * nightly schedule, so one failure would mean no backup for a whole day.

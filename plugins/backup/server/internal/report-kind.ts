 * target that refused means the archive exists and went nowhere; and a run that
 * died in assembly, or was killed before recording anything, produced no
 * archive at all. Collapsing those under one heading would make the report say
 * the archive is missing a piece when in fact there is no archive.

/**
 * The `backup-incomplete` report kind: **the nightly backup did not fully
 * succeed.**
 *
 * This kind exists because of a three-night outage that alerted NOWHERE. The
 * backup ledger recorded `failed` each night and the run card said so, but
 * nothing pushed it: the bell stayed quiet, Reports held no row for it, and the
 * only way to learn that the machine had gone three days without an archive —
 * and six without an off-site copy — was to open the backup pane and look.
 * Under the front-door invariant that is the bug behind the bug, so the signal
 * now lands in the funnel everything else lands in.
 *
 * Variant `error`, with no warning arm for `partial`. A backup is the artifact
 * you only reach for when everything else is gone, so "we archived most of it"
 * and "we archived it but it never left the machine" are both the failure this
 * is for. Grading them would mean the quieter one is the one that goes unread.
 *
 * Deduped on WHAT is missing, not on the run: the same gap recurring every
 * night is one problem and collapses onto one row with a rising count, while a
 * new source starting to fail mints its own. The cooldown re-arms the bell
 * daily-ish, so a standing gap resurfaces instead of being marked read once and
 * never seen again.
 *
 * `duressExempt`, for the reason the queue-health kinds are: a backup is most
 * likely to fail on a night the box is in trouble, which is exactly the night
 * the shed engine would buffer this away.

/**
 * Boot-time sweep of the wreckage a hard-killed backup leaves on disk: an
 * orphaned ~GB `staging/` dir that would survive forever and corrupt retention,
 * a `.partial` sidecar, and a truncated archive.
 *
 * **A filesystem sweep, and nothing else.** It used to have a second arm that
 * marked every unfinished `backup_runs` row failed, on the reasoning that a row
 * still open at boot meant a process that died. That reasoning is now false and
 * the arm would be actively destructive: a backup runs in a detached child that
 * SURVIVES a backend restart, so the most likely unfinished row at boot belongs
 * to a backup that is still going — the very outcome this workstream exists to
 * produce. Closing rows is the supervised job's job now (`closeBackupRow`,
 * driven by the child's own exit marker); this function must never write to the
 * ledger.
 *
 * The same argument applies to the files, which is why the guard below exists:
 * a live run's `staging/` is mid-write, and deleting it would kill the backup
 * that survived the restart just as surely as failing its row would.
 *
 * Host-global BACKUPS_DIR + main-only lifecycle: callers gate on isMain().

// it is deferred past serving-ready, throttled, and scope-gated by the warmup
// executor. `worktree` scope — pages live in each worktree's own DB, so every
// backend must seed its own corpus (this is not host-global work). The warm-up
// body only enqueues; the (now incremental) scan runs in the job.

 * The factory id is `"pages.detail"` — NOT `"pages"` — because the emitted slot

 *    full page `row` (derive id/title from it) via `ItemActionProps<PageRow>`.
 *  - `Fields` — extra DataView `FieldDef<PageRow>[]` injected by other plugins. A
 *    field extension is a *component* (not plain data) so its `value` closure can
 *    capture hook-loaded data — e.g. `starred` reads its own live resource and
 *    yields a `starred` bool field. Contributed fields show up in the Sort pill,

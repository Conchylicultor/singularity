 * Create a new page and seed it with content blocks so it is immediately
 * typeable. By default a page is seeded with one empty text block; callers
 * (e.g. the landing-page templates) may override the title and/or the seed
 * block list to start the page from a template.
 *
 * A brand-new page has no content blocks, and `BlockEditor` renders nothing
 * typeable in that state — the first block can only be created by splitting an
 * existing one. So every page must start with at least one block; when `seed`
 * is omitted we fall back to a single empty text block.
 *
 * This lives in the consumer (the pages app) rather than the editor plugin on
 * purpose: the editor plugin must not import the text block
 * (`@plugins/page/plugins/text`), since that would create an editor↔text plugin
 * cycle. The pages app may depend on both editor and text (acyclic), so it is
 * the right place to combine them. Centralizing here keeps every create path
 * (root "New Page", per-row "Add child", landing templates) seeding
 * consistently — and template seed payloads come pre-shaped from the caller's
 * block cores, which the server stores as-is.
 *
 * Seed blocks are parented to the page block (`parentId: page.id`):
 * `computePageId(null)` is null, so top-level page content must hang off the
 * page node, which the server then stamps with the page's `pageId`. They are
 * created sequentially (await each, in order) with no explicit rank, so the
 * server appends them in caller order.
 *
 * Returns the new page id so the caller can open it.

 * The page's big in-body title.

 * It is one of the two caret surfaces of a page — the block list below it is the
 * other — and it implements the editor's own `CaretSurface` contract so the caret
 * can cross between them exactly as it crosses between two blocks. The traffic
 * runs both ways through that contract:
 *
 * - Downward (here): Enter, ArrowDown, and ArrowRight-at-the-end hand the caret to
 *   `body`, which is a `CaretSurface` too.
 * - Upward (there): ArrowUp, ArrowLeft-at-the-start, and Backspace-at-the-start of
 *   the first block resolve to a backwards `nav`, which the editor lands on this
 *   component via the `ref` the host passes as `<BlockEditor caretBefore>`.
 *
 * A title is a single line, so it exposes only the boundary landing: entering from
 * below always parks the caret at its end. Nothing here knows about blocks.

 * sub-pages, CRDT docs, and version history all survive), so the honest
 * affordance is an Undo, not a "cannot be undone" warning.
 *
 * The undo entry is recorded by the `infra/trash` seam onto the TAB's history, so
 * Cmd+Z restores the page from anywhere in the tab — and the toast's Undo button

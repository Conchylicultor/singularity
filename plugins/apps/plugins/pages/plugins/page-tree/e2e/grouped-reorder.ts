/**
 * Pins the regression: the Pages sidebar tree must stay **drag-reorderable while
 * it shows only part of the roots**.
 *
 * The sidebar splits the page tree into sections — Private (`origin is user`)
 * and Scratch (`origin is agent`), each a root-scoped filter of its own view —
 * and before that into `groupBy: "origin"` groups. The tree used to drop
 * `hierarchy.onMove` whenever it saw only part of the roots (under a group-by)
 * — so reordering silently stopped working in the default view, with no
 * visible cause. The suspension existed because a partial `TreeList` could mint
 * a rank colliding with a hidden root; the drop contract now carries only an
 * anchor, which the server resolves against the complete sibling set
 * (`research/2026-07-30-global-anchor-only-rank-authority.md`).
 *
 * ## What this asserts, and why it is the affordance rather than a gesture
 *
 * `RowChrome` wires the row's drag source **only** when `canReorder`
 * (`= !!onMove`, `tree-list.tsx`). So dnd-kit's draggable attributes
 * (`aria-roledescription="draggable"`, `aria-disabled="false"`) are present on a
 * grouped row **iff** `onMove` survived the gate — which is exactly the bug.
 * Under the old code they were absent, because the tree passed no handler.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT synthesize a pointer drag. dnd-kit's `PointerSensor`
 * does not reliably activate under Playwright's synthetic pointer stream, so a
 * simulated drag here reports nothing about the product — an earlier version of
 * this file did exactly that and produced a false PASS while a loose
 * `getByText().first()` grabbed a page-link in the editor and let the *block*
 * editor's own DnD reparent a page. Rows are therefore located as tree rows
 * (`.group/tree-row` containing the exact label), never page-wide text.
 *
 * The rank round-trip the drop depends on is covered where it can be asserted
 * exactly — `rankAdjacentTo`'s unit tests
 * (`plugins/primitives/plugins/rank/server/internal/adjacent.test.ts`) and the
 * `POST /api/blocks/:id/move` contract itself.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/pages/plugins/page-tree/e2e/grouped-reorder.ts [--headed]

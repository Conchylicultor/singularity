/**
 * Verifies that creating a page from the sidebar tree OPENS it.
 *
 * A row's hover "+" ("Add child") creates the page and asks the tree to
 * activate it by the id the create returned — one live-state round-trip before
 * the row itself lands. The data-view tree layer used to drop an activation it
 * could not resolve to a row yet, so the page was created and the user stayed
 * on whatever was already open. It now holds the id and activates on arrival.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/pages/plugins/page-tree/e2e/add-child-opens-page.ts [--headed]

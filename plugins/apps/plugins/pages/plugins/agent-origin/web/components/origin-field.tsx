 * closed over the set. That makes `origin` a filter dimension of the one
 * `pages-sidebar` DataView — the **Private** and **Scratch** sections are two
 * view instances of it, `origin is user` / `origin is agent`, each authored
 * with `filterScope: "roots"` in that surface's config, with no bespoke
 * sidebar.

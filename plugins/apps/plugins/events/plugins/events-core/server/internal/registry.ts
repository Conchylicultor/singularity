 * ## Why two phases instead of one `run()`
 *
 * The split makes the extraction cache **structural**. The engine holds
 * `lastFingerprint`, so it is literally unable to call `extract` on an unchanged
 * source: it compares the probe's fingerprint first and returns
 * `outcome: "unchanged"` without ever reaching the expensive half. A single
 * `run()` returning `{ unchanged } | { events }` would leave "don't pay for the
 * LLM when nothing changed" as per-provider discipline that a future marketplace
 * source type silently forgets — the cost of forgetting being real money, on
 * every tick, invisibly.
 *
 * ## Failure is a type, never an absorbable value
 *
 * `probe` / `extract` **throw**. A plain throw is transient (the refresh job
 * retries); `NonRetryableError` from `@plugins/infra/plugins/jobs/server` is
 * terminal and gets classified onto the source row's `status: "error"` +
 * `lastError`. A source type must NEVER return `[]` to mean "it broke" — an
 * empty array means the page genuinely lists no events, and the engine will
 * happily stamp `disappearedAt` on everything it previously found.

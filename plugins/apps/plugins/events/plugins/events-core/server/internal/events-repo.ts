//
// Why a funnel rather than "remember to set updatedAt": the `events.revision`
// live tick is `count(*) + max(updated_at)`, so a write that forgets the stamp
// lands in the DB and never reaches the open DataView — a silent staleness bug,
// invisible in tests, that any future writer re-introduces for free. Here the
// stamp is applied by the only code that can write, so forgetting it is not
// expressible. The barrel therefore exports the events table as a READ handle
// (`eventsTable`) plus the writers below, and the `events/no-raw-events-write`
// lint rule fails any `db.insert/update/delete(eventsTable)` outside this file.
//
// The three functions below are the only write SHAPES performed on `events`:
// the extraction diff ("upsert → stamp disappearedAt") plus the re-anchor that
// keeps a recurring row's occurrence projection current as time passes.
// Everything else about refreshing — externalId derivation, the run ledger,
// error classification, scheduling — is the `refresh` plugin's, and is
// deliberately not here.

 * at any instant. The `startsAt` / `endsAt` / `allDay` COLUMNS are the
 * denormalized answer for one instant — the one the extraction ran at — because
 * the list filters, sorts and keyset-paginates on plain indexed columns rather
 * than digging into jsonb. That answer expires the moment the occurrence it
 * names passes.
 *
 * So the columns are maintained derived state, and this is the maintainer.
 * Without it a weekly event keeps claiming to start on the last day it was
 * scraped, and every "upcoming" view — a `startsAt >= today` filter — silently
 * drops a series that is still running. That is not hypothetical: it is what
 * made six live weekly events invisible on the Events list, and it gets worse
 * the longer a source goes without a re-extraction (a manual-refresh source
 * goes without one indefinitely).
 *
 * EVERY recurring row is examined, not just the ones whose anchor has visibly
 * passed. The invariant being restored is "`startsAt` is the occurrence at or
 * after the start of today", and a row can violate it in both directions — an
 * anchor too far FORWARD (a bad extraction, or a sweep that once resolved at
 * the wall clock and skipped an all-day occurrence) is invisible to a
 * `startsAt < today` candidate query, so such a query can only ratchet and
 * never converge. Checking all of them costs one indexed read of a set bounded
 * by the recurring events, and `planReanchor` answers `keep` for the ones
 * already right, so a correct pass still writes nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT limited: a cap would leave the remainder stale, which is the
 * exact bug this closes.
 *
 * A series with no occurrence left is left ALONE rather than stamped or
 * deleted. Its last anchor is the honest answer to "when does this happen" —
 * it happened, and it is over — and falling out of an "upcoming" filter is
 * then correct rather than a symptom.
 *
 * Disappeared rows are re-anchored too: the column means the same thing on
 * every row, and a row the source stops listing is hidden by the query's own
 * default rather than by a lie in its date.

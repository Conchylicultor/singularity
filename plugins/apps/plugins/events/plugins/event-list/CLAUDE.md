# event-list

The Events app's main surface: every event, as a **live DataView**
(`defineDataView("events.list")`) over the `events.list` collection
(`core/internal/collection.ts`). The set grows without bound and the user
filters/sorts across all of it, so filter/sort/search compile to SQL per window
tuple, read as a segmented scroll (`scroll: true`) — the mail threads shape.

```
core/internal/fields.ts       the shared field-id vocabulary (browser-safe data)
  ↓                                ↓
web/internal/fields.tsx       core/internal/collection.ts   (liveCollection)
  (FieldDef[] + value/cell)        ↓
                              server/internal/collection.ts (serveCollection:
                                the source lookup + the default scopes)
```

One vocabulary, two runtimes: the web `FieldDef[]` derives from
`EVENT_LIST_FIELDS`, and the collection declares `EVENT_LIST_FILTERABLE` /
`EVENT_LIST_SORTABLE` (the same file), so they cannot drift on which dimensions
exist or what domain they filter in.

## Live, with no tick

The list is kept fresh by the routed change feed
(`research/2026-09-29-global-scoped-change-routing.md`, P4), never by a
revision tick and a refetch:

- an event write refills exactly that event in the segments that hold (or now
  admit) it; one no tuple's where / order reads (a title edit) reaches only the
  windows holding the event (`moves`);
- each row carries its source's ref (`sourceType` / `sourceConfig`, a REQUIRED
  lookup `source` on `events.source_id`), so a source write reaches the list
  through the lookup's REVERSE route, gated on the source columns the list reads
  (`id`, `type`, `config`, `enabled`): a run's `status` / watermark writes reach
  nothing; a type / config edit refills that source's events a tuple holds; an
  `enabled` flip refills its events (at most 500, then the window reloads,
  bounded);
- a deleted source's events arrive as event deletes (the FK cascade);
- the sighting stamps (`firstSeenAt` / `lastSeenAt`) are not on a listed event
  (`ListedEvent`), so a re-extraction that finds nothing new moves no row.

`e2e/list-live-verify.ts` drives each arm against a deploy.

## Every typed field is a filter AND a sort dimension

That is the whole reason this is a DataView. Adding a dimension means adding a
`FieldDef` + an `EVENT_LIST_FILTERABLE` entry (and `EVENT_LIST_SORTABLE`, if it
sorts — the live source refuses a sortable field whose column is not) — **never**
a bespoke toggle chip on the toolbar, and never a hand-rolled `.map()` of
`<Row>` (`no-adhoc-row-list`). A few ids differ between the two sides on purpose:

- **`sourceId` is declared with no web field here.** The `source` dimension
  arrives as a *contributed* field extension through the exported
  `EventList.Fields` descriptor — only the `sources` plugin holds the live
  `event_sources` rows its option list is built from. Because the column is
  already declared under the same id, that contributed field filters and sorts
  server-side the moment it lands, with zero edits here. This plugin names no
  source type, ever.
- **`tags` is the jsonb string array**, filtered in the `stringArray` domain
  (has all / any / none of). It is not sortable: a jsonb array has no order.
- **`description` is searched only** (no field): the search box lowers to
  `contains` over `EVENT_LIST_SEARCHABLE`. A tag is not searchable text any
  more (the fetchPage query searched `tags::text`; a live collection's filterable
  columns are row fields) — the Tags filter finds one.

## Disappeared events, and a disabled source's, are hidden by DEFAULT

Both are the collection's `defaults` (`server/internal/collection.ts`, network/live's
default scopes): a predicate ANDed into a tuple unless its filter names the
column, with any op.

- **Disappearance is soft** (`disappearedAt` stamped, row never deleted), so
  those rows must not clutter an ordinary browse — but they must stay reachable,
  since a user may have annotated one. Naming `disappearedAt` is the view saying
  "I know about disappearance — here is what I want".
- **Disabling a source** is the user saying "I don't care about this any more",
  so its events stop cluttering the list — but nothing is deleted or stamped, so
  re-enabling the source brings every one of them straight back. Naming the
  `source` dimension ("source is X", "source is not empty") is asking about
  sources, a disabled one's events included.

The predicate is on the joined `event_sources` row, stated positively as "the
source is active" — never a denormalized `enabled` copy on the event row, which
would duplicate a *mutable* FK attribute across an unbounded table and owe a
backfill on every flip. The flip is routed instead (above).

## The gallery cover is an accessor, not a field

The poster comes from `viewOptions.gallery.cover` in `web/panes.tsx`, not from
`coverField` — which resolves only `FieldDef` ids, and `imageUrl` is deliberately
not a field (above). Don't mint one for the gallery: that adds a dead sort/filter
axis to every view to serve one view's chrome.

The src passes `externalUrl()` (absolute `http(s)` only — rows come from
untrusted scraped pages). The browser then loads it **directly from the event's
host**, unlike mail's `remote-images` proxy: an email image is an attacker-chosen
per-recipient tracking pixel, an event poster is a public asset on a site the
user configured. A same-origin proxy here would belong in a generic primitive,
not a copy of mail's app-scoped route.

## A row opens the event's page, else its source's

`onRowActivate` (host-level, so list/table/gallery agree) resolves
`event.url ?? source origin URL` through `externalUrl()`. The fallback is the
common case — an extraction often yields no per-event link — and it comes from
the source ref joined onto every row (`SourcedEvent`'s `sourceType` /
`sourceConfig`, read back by `sourceRefOf`), through `events-core`'s
`useEventSourceOrigin()`, whose answer each source type supplies via its
`originUrl`. No sources window is read, so an event of any source resolves, and
nothing is ever "not loaded yet". This plugin still names no source type. No
destination (hand-entered event) → the click is a no-op.

## Config is the only source of view instances

There is no code-synthesized default: the instances come only from
`config/apps/events/event-list/events.list.jsonc`, and
`config:overrides-authored` fails until its `// @review` marker is deleted. The
intended set is `Upcoming` (filter `startsAt is-on-or-after` today, sort
ascending), `All`, and `By category` (grouped). The surface is the collection's
`columnScope`, so its custom columns sort and filter server-side.

## Plugin reference

Reachable from the Events sidebar. Events DataView server: the `events.list` live collection over the events table joined to its source (a required lookup, routed in reverse: a source write refills that source's events, gated on the columns the list reads), with soft-deleted events and a disabled source's events hidden by default.

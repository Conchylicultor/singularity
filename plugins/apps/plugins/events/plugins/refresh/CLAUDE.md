# refresh

The Events app's **engine**: the only code that knows how a source becomes rows.
`events-core` owns the contracts, a source type owns the HTTP/LLM detail, this
owns everything between.

## `runSource` — the phase order, in one place

```
mark running → probe() → fingerprint === lastFingerprint ?
   yes → record run{unchanged}, bump the watermark, DONE      (extract never runs)
   no  → extract() → derive identities → upsert → stamp disappearances
       → record run{extracted}, store the fingerprint, bump the watermark
```

Two invariants the *shape* enforces:

- **`extract` is unreachable on a cache hit.** The engine — not the source type —
  holds `lastFingerprint`, so "don't pay for the model when nothing changed"
  cannot be forgotten by a future marketplace source type. `fingerprint: null` is
  never a hit — it declares "cannot probe cheaply", so that source always
  extracts; do not "simplify" the guard to a bare `===`, which would turn that
  declaration into a permanent skip.
- **Disappearance is stamped only after a successful full extraction** — the call
  sits inside the `try` after `extract`, so any failure exits before it, and a
  failed run also leaves `lastFingerprint` untouched (else the NEXT run skips
  extraction for material we never read).

## Identity is derived here, not per source type

`events` is unique on `(source_id, external_id)`, so identity IS idempotence. An
LLM extraction has no upstream id, and letting each type invent its own fallback
would make idempotence a per-provider discipline one of them gets wrong.
`external-id.ts` derives
`sha256(sourceId + normalizedTitle + eventDateIdentityKey(date))`, and the date
half is where the whole design sits:

- a **one-off** contributes the UTC **day** key of its instant — a door time
  nudged 30 min is the same party. Byte-identical to the pre-recurrence
  derivation, so no existing row's identity moved when the format landed
  (pinned by a literal digest in `external-id.test.ts`).
- a **series** contributes its RULE signature, independent of the anchor. One
  series is ONE row: next week's extraction reports a later anchor, and hashing
  that would insert a duplicate every week and bury the previous one as
  disappeared.

`plan-writes.ts` is a **pure function** (no DB, no randomness, and `now` is a
parameter rather than a clock read — even `events.id` is derived), which is what
makes the interesting half of the engine unit-testable. One extracted event
becomes exactly one row. It re-validates the extractor's output rather than
trusting it, collapses same-identity duplicates last-wins, and writes every
absent optional as an explicit `null` — the upsert's conflict path sets exactly
the keys present, so an omitted key would keep a price the venue removed on the
row forever.

`date` is written verbatim and the `startsAt`/`endsAt`/`allDay`/`recurring`/
`recurrenceLabel` columns are **projections** of it (`eventDateProjection`), never
hand-set — one fact, one writable home. The anchor is re-derived through
`nextOccurrence(date, now)` rather than trusted: a model that anchors "every
Thursday" on a Tuesday is corrected deterministically. An **exhausted** series
(`{ found: false }` — its `until` passed) drops out of the plan *and* the
seen-set, so its row is stamped disappeared: "this series has ended", not a
failure.

## Scheduling

`events.refresh-tick` — `*/15 * * * *`, `singleton`, **main-only**
(`perWorktree` unset). The cron job is the sanctioned no-polling exception (a
scraped page has no change signal to subscribe to). Main-only because worktrees
inherit events through the DB fork — a per-worktree schedule would have every
live agent worktree hammering the same third-party sites. "Refresh now" is a
normal endpoint and still works in any worktree.

Its whole decision is `enabled AND refresh <> 'manual' AND (next_run_at IS NULL OR
next_run_at <= now)`. `next_run_at` is the only watermark, so a cadence change
needs no cron edit; the NULL branch exists because `<= now` alone silently
strands a scheduled source that has no watermark.

`events.refresh-source` — `dedup: { key: sourceId }`, `maxAttempts: 3`: tick,
click, and retry coalesce onto one run rather than racing two model calls over
one page.

## Terminal vs transient

`classify-error.ts` is pure and matches on `error.name`, never `instanceof` —
both recognised classes set `name`, and a name check survives the module-identity
differences that would misclassify a terminal failure as transient.

`NonRetryableError`→`source`, `SsrfError`→`blocked_url`, `ZodError`→`extraction`,
`UnknownSourceTypeError`→`config` are terminal; **everything else is transient**
(guessing wrong costs a few retries, whereas guessing terminal parks a healthy
source until a human notices).

Terminal → source row parked `status: "error"` + classified message, rethrown as
`NonRetryableError` so graphile dead-letters after ONE attempt instead of paying
for three identical failures. Transient → detail stays on the run row
(`lastError` is terminal-only), source drops to `idle`, graphile retries. Either
way a `failed` run row is written and the job still throws: recording it is
reporting, not handling.

## Extraction caveats

`extract` returns `{ events, flags }`. `flags` is what the extractor could not
*express* on a run that otherwise succeeded — never a failure, never per event.
`finishExtracted` writes it to the run row AND to the source's `lastFlags` in the
same transaction; `finishUnchanged`/`finishFailed` write `flags: []` on their own
row and leave `lastFlags` **alone** — neither re-read the page, so the last
extraction's caveats still stand.

## The ledger is written at the end, not the start

`run-ledger.ts` is the only writer of `event_source_runs` and of a source row's
runtime state, and writes both **in one transaction** — a source that says
`error` always has the failed run explaining it. Inserting only at the end means
every ledger row is complete by construction; an in-flight run is already visible
as `status: "running"` on the live-pushed source row.

The run's **id** is the exception, minted by `runSource` before the first phase
and handed to the phases (`ProbeContext.runId`) and to every `finish*`. A nuance,
not a reversal — nothing is *written* earlier, so rows stay complete by
construction; only the identity exists earlier, which is what lets work in flight
(a model call, a fetched artifact) stamp itself with the run it belongs to. Don't
"fix" it back to minting the id at insert time.

A backend killed mid-run leaves `running` set. That is cured, not swept:
`runSource` re-marks the row every run, and "Refresh now" **enqueues even when the
row says running** (reporting `already-running` only as a hint), because gating on
a row flag would make a wedged source permanently unrefreshable.

## Retention

Both sweeps live here, not in `events-core`, because this plugin owns the writes.
`events` disappeared > 90 d (a live event is `disappeared_at IS NULL`, structurally
out of reach of the predicate); `event_source_runs` > 30 d. Main-only — the
canonical DB is main's, a worktree fork is ephemeral.

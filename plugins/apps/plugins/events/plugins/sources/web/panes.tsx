/**
 * One source: `/events/sources/source/:sourceId`.
 *
 * Chaining under the list keeps it beside this pane as a Miller column, which is
 * also what puts the list segment in the URL — a pane's path is its route chain,
 * so this cannot be the design doc's `/events/s/:id` without orphaning the list.
 * The chain is what types every descendant's params as the full `{ sourceId, … }`
 * too, so a run can be opened by a caller holding no source route of its own.
 *
 * The `source/` prefix is mandatory AND must be globally distinct, for two
 * separate reasons: a segment starting with a bare `:param` is REJECTED
 * (URL-parsing ambiguity), and pane segments are matched across the whole app —
 * param names do not disambiguate, so a short `s/:sourceId` collides with
 * Story's `s/:pageId` (`pane:segments-unique` catches it at build; left unfixed
 * it throws at runtime on navigation). Spelling the noun in full is the same
 * shape `deploy/servers` uses for `server/:serverId` under its `servers` list.

/**
 * Proves the run ledger is a LIVE window (`events.source-runs`), sorted and
 * filtered by a custom column server-side, with no reload:
 *
 *  1. seeds three failed runs on a source (each run's error IS its id, so its
 *     row is findable by the text the list renders for a failure);
 *  2. defines a number custom column on the runs surface, gives the runs
 *     3 / 1 / 2, and sets the landing view to sort by it ascending and keep
 *     `> 0`; opens the source — the list reads b, c, a;
 *  3. a → 0: a leaves (the filter); a → 5: it comes back, last; c → 9: c moves
 *     to the bottom; each in place;
 *  4. a fourth run lands in the database — the very insert a refresh's
 *     run-ledger makes at the end of a run — with a value: it appears in its
 *     sorted place. (Seeded rather than a real "Refresh now", which fetches a
 *     live page and may pay for a model call: the claim is about the ledger
 *     write reaching the screen, and the seeded insert is that write.)
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the NO-RELOAD one: a marker stamped on
 * `window` before the first live change must survive to the end, or "the row
 * is there" could equally mean "the page came back with fresh data".
 *
 * The seeded runs and their cells are deleted at the end (also on failure);
 * the surface's config writes are put back by the harness's agent-write ledger.
 * Refuses main (it seeds rows into the deploy's database).
 *
 * Manual only, like every script under `e2e/`:
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/events/plugins/sources/plugins/source-detail/plugins/runs/e2e/runs-live-verify.ts [--source <sourceId>] [--headed]

/**
 * One run: `/events/sources/source/:sourceId/run/:runId`.
 *
 * Chaining to `eventSourceDetailRoute` is what puts the source in the URL, and
 * what types an opener's params as the full `{ sourceId, runId }`. Today the one
 * opener is the runs section inside the source pane, so the source slot is
 * already to its left and the push inherits it; the chained param it passes is
 * spare. A caller holding no source route of its own would have to open with
 * `mode: "root"`, which is the path that reads the supplied `sourceId` and
 * builds the chain from scratch — nothing does that yet.
 *
 * The run is still read by its OWN id (the `events.source-runs` point sibling,
 * `useLiveRow`) rather than reached through the source's runs list, and that is
 * unrelated to the chain: a deep link must resolve from the URL alone, not from
 * whatever window the parent's list happens to have loaded. (`useParams()` stays own-only, so
 * this pane reads `runId`; the source id stays the source pane's to read.)
 *
 * `run/` is globally distinct after param-name erasure — segments are matched
 * across the whole app and param names do not disambiguate. `rg 'segment: "run'`
 * finds nothing else; the nearby `r/:runId` (build) and `rel/:runId` (Studio
 * release) are why the noun is spelled in full, the same call
 * `deploy/deployments` makes with `dep/:deploymentId`.
 *
 * `titleOwner` is deliberately NOT set — the source page keeps the tab title; a
 * run is a drill-in under it, not a new main surface.

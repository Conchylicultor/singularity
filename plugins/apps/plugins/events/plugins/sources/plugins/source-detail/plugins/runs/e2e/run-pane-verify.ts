/**
 * Drives the run ledger's one affordance: click a run row and land on the run's
 * own pane, carrying its contributed regions.
 *
 * The row itself is the target. It used to be a hover-revealed "Open run" action
 * pinned over the row, and this script used to assert the hit test at the
 * action's centre — the row body is a button and won that stack, so the action
 * was unreachable by pointer. Activating the row removes the stack rather than
 * arbitrating it, which is why the hit test is gone from here too: there is now
 * one target and it is the whole row.
 *
 * Manual only, like every script under `e2e/`. Needs a deployed worktree and a
 * source that has run at least once:
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/events/plugins/sources/plugins/source-detail/plugins/runs/e2e/run-pane-verify.ts --source <sourceId>

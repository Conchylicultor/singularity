/**
 * Turn one `RefreshAllResult` into the toast that reports it — arm by arm,
 * the same discipline the single-source `RefreshSourceResult` gets in the
 * schedule section, for the same reason: a resolved promise is NOT
 * "everything refreshed", and a tally is only worth returning if the caller
 * renders all of it.
 *
 * Each count is a genuinely different thing the user needs to know when the
 * list does not move afterwards:
 *
 * - `enqueued` — runs that will actually start.
 * - `alreadyRunning` — sources mid-run; the request joined the run in flight
 *   rather than starting a second one.
 * - `skipped` — a source disabled between the server's listing and its own
 *   enqueue. Rare and racy, but a real refusal of a request we did make, which
 *   is why the tally carries it at all. A source that was simply disabled all
 *   along is counted NOWHERE — nothing was asked of it, so it is not a skip.
 *
 * Never `success`: what succeeded is the *enqueue*, and the runs have not
 * happened yet. Claiming success for work that has not started is exactly the
 * over-statement the arms exist to avoid.

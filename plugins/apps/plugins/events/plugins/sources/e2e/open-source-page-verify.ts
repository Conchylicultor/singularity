/**
 * End-to-end check of the sources list's `open` row action, against a deployed
 * worktree.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/events/plugins/sources/e2e/open-source-page-verify.ts [--headed]
 *
 * Each step is written against a claim the action is built on, not a pixel:
 *
 *   1. it is a real LINK, not a button calling `window.open`. That is the whole
 *      reason it renders an `<a>` — the browser previews the destination on
 *      hover and its own link gestures work — and none of that survives a
 *      button;
 *   2. every destination is an ordinary `http(s)` address opening in a new tab.
 *      A source's URL is read out of a free-text config field, so the gate is
 *      `useEventSourceOrigin`'s, and a relative or `javascript:` string must
 *      never reach an href;
 *   3. the action belongs to ITS row — matched by geometry, because every row's
 *      cluster is in the DOM at all times (the reveal couples opacity with
 *      pointer-events) and a page-wide match returns a neighbour's just as
 *      happily;
 *   4. a source type that stands for no page renders NOTHING rather than a dead
 *      button. `manual` is that type — the user IS the extractor — so its rows
 *      are the assertion.
 *
 * Read-only: it opens no tab and writes nothing, so it is safe against a
 * populated instance and needs no cleanup. It deliberately never CLICKS the
 * link: following it would fetch a third-party site, and what a browser does
 * with an `<a target="_blank">` is not this app's behaviour to test.

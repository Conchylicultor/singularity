/**
 * End-to-end check of the three source ACTIONS, against a deployed worktree.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   bun plugins/apps/plugins/events/plugins/sources/e2e/source-actions-verify.ts [--headed]
 *
 * `sources-verify.ts` covers the surface (the registry-driven `+` menu, the
 * generated form, the contributed sections). This one covers what the row and
 * the toolbar DO, and each step is written against a claim about the design
 * rather than against a pixel:
 *
 *   1. the row toggle is an ACTION, not a navigation — the button lives beside
 *      the row's own primary button and stops the click, so disabling a source
 *      never also opens its detail pane, and the very same button (relabelled)
 *      puts it back. That reversibility is why the action carries no confirm;
 *   2. a disabled source's events leave the events list as a query-time
 *      DEFAULT, never a delete. Three assertions, because that one word is the
 *      whole design: the unfiltered list drops by exactly the source's own
 *      count; a filter that NAMES `sourceId` still returns every one of them
 *      (naming the dimension defeats the default — `shouldHideInactiveSources`
 *      in event-list's `scope.ts`, the same rule `disappearedAt` gets); and
 *      re-enabling restores the original count, so nothing was stamped, moved
 *      or deleted;
 *   3. that scope is PUSHED, not polled. The toggle is flipped out-of-band
 *      (a PATCH from this script, never through the open tab's own UI), so an
 *      events list that updates can only have learned it from the server —
 *      `events-core`'s `events.revision` tick folding in the active-source set;
 *   4. "Refresh all" is a SET operation with a tally, and the tally is rendered
 *      arm by arm — a resolved promise is not "everything refreshed". Every arm
 *      `describeRefreshAll` can produce is accepted, so a deploy whose sources
 *      are all disabled passes honestly instead of demanding a success chirp.
 *
 * The fourth is checked last because it is the only one that spends anything:
 * it ENQUEUES real runs (a probe per enabled source, and an extraction — a live
 * model call for a `url` source — only where the page actually moved). The
 * script therefore asserts on the enqueue tally and never on a run's outcome;
 * the runs land long after it exits.
 *
 * Reads the app's own data through the app's own endpoints, in the page's own
 * session, so it keeps working on a machine whose sources are not this one's.
 *
 * Idempotent: every source it switches off is switched back on in a `finally`,
 * so a killed run cannot leave a source quietly disabled.

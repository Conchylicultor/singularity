/**
 * End-to-end smoke of the Events Sources surface, against a deployed worktree.
 *
 * Manual only. Run after `./singularity build`:
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/events/plugins/sources/e2e/sources-verify.ts [--headed]
 *
 * Verifies the registry-driven promises this plugin is built on, not just that
 * pixels appeared:
 *   1. the `+` menu IS the source-type registry (BOTH installed types appear,
 *      while nothing under `web/` names either of them);
 *   2. the add form is GENERATED from the type's own `configFields` — the
 *      zero-field type says "nothing to configure", the URL type grows a form;
 *   3. a created source round-trips to the list and opens its detail pane;
 *   4. the detail pane's sections are contributions, gated by `useAvailable`;
 *   5. a source can be RENAMED after creation, and an emptied name comes back as
 *      the server-derived default rather than a blank row;
 *   6. the `source` dimension reaches the *events* DataView's Filter — the field
 *      extension crossing a plugin boundary.
 *
 * Deliberately stops short of creating a `Web page` source: its `extract` phase
 * spends a live model call. The extraction path is a separate, explicit test.
 *
 * Idempotent: the source it creates is deleted in a `finally`, so repeat runs do
 * not silt up the sources list.

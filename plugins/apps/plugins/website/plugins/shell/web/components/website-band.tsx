 * matter which plugin drew them. That measure is declared here and nowhere else;
 * a section that sets its own `max-w-*` is a section that will drift.
 *
 * `divider` paints the hairline ABOVE the band. The site separates its bands
 * with a rule rather than with more air, which is what keeps a long page reading
 * as one document rather than a stack of unrelated cards. The rule is as wide
 * as the measure, not the viewport — it belongs to the column of text it
 * divides — which is why it and the rhythm's padding sit on the measure box:
 * the rule above the padding, both inside the gutter.
 *
 * `rhythm` is the band's vertical padding, named by the band's role rather than
 * spelled as a ramp step: the page's rhythm is a designed scale of its own, and
 * it lives in `website-band.css`.

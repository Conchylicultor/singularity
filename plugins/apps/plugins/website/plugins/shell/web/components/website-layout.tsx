/**
 * The website's app surface. A pure full-surface app (like Sonata): the
 * full-pane renderer paints the active site pane — landing at `/website`,
 * pillars / downloads at their own segments — filling the whole surface. The
 * persistent site header is NOT a layout concern: it is the shared
 * `WebsiteHeader` pane-header slot every website pane borrows, so navigation
 * chrome and pane chrome are one bar.
 *
 * The visit tracker is mounted here, beside the pane renderer rather than inside
 * any pane's chrome: this component is the app's surface, which stays mounted
 * while the visitor moves between pages, whereas each page's `WebsiteChrome`
 * is replaced with the pane it wraps.

/**
 * The wash's geometry, as the design measured it: a 1100×700 ellipse tile
 * centred on the page, its top 120px above the document's top edge. The
 * document's top edge is the site header's top — the header floats over the
 * page, 72px tall above this band, and is clear at rest so the wash shows
 * through it — so the tile starts 192px above the band.
 * Measurements, not ramp steps, which is what `<Placed>` is for. The width
 * caps at the pane's so a narrow viewport never scrolls sideways to reach it
 * (the blur beyond the box is ink, not scrollable overflow).

 *
 * Centred — the one place on the site that is. Everything below returns to the
 * left edge, which is what makes the heading read as a title rather than as the
 * house style. The headline and the lede each cap their own measure inside the
 * band's (900px and 720px on the title page; an inner page's 58px headline needs
 * no cap and its lede caps at 640px), centred by the stack.
 *
 * The glow is part of the heading rather than of the page because the heading is
 * what it lights: every page has exactly one, so every page has the glow. It is
 * deliberately NOT clipped to the band: its tail softens the top of the band
 * below, and it sits under the text because the band is positioned after it.

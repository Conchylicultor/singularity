/**
 * The landing pane — the site's index at bare `/website`. `appIndex` marks it
 * as the app's index pane.
 *
 * It wears the shared site header (`actions: WebsiteHeader`) like every other
 * website pane: the homepage is where the reader arrives, so the wordmark and the
 * nav have to be there before anything else can send them somewhere. The header
 * is declared once, by this plugin, and borrowed by all four pages.
 *
 * The body is the landing page itself: every `Website.Section` contribution
 * rendered top-to-bottom — the hero, the fork, the story link, the contact band —
 * in the order authored in `config/apps/website/shell/section.jsonc`. That file,
 * not the plugin load order, is what fixes the page's reading order.

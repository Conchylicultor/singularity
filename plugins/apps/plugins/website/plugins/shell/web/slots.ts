/**
 * The shared site header — ONE pane header slot worn by every website pane, so
 * the nav persists across the whole site and is authored in one place: one
 * contribution list, one reorder directive, one `⋯`.
 *
 * A pane borrows it with `Pane.define({ actions: WebsiteHeader })`; its
 * `pane.Actions` then IS this slot. It is declared exactly ONCE, by this plugin
 * (`slots: { header: WebsiteHeader }`), and the borrowing panes are deliberately
 * absent from their own plugins' `slots:` records — declaring one slot under two
 * names is what the declaration pass rejects.
 *
 * The shell contributes the wordmark; page plugins contribute their nav links
 * (use `<WebsiteNavLink/>` for the standard look). Which of them lead and which
 * trail is the slot's reorder config — see
 * `config/apps/website/shell/header.jsonc`, where the wordmark sits ahead of the
 * spacer and the nav packs against the trailing edge.

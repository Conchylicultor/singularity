 * The band between the fork and the contact block: one line offering the story

 *
 * It is a sentence with a link in it, not a call to action — the two cards above
 * are the page's real choices, and this must not compete with them. Which is why
 * it is one centred line on its own rule, and why the link is the `inline`
 * aspect of a `link` button — it takes the sentence's own size and sits in its
 * flow, underlined in the quiet grey, coming up to full foreground on hover —
 * rather than anything boxed or filled.

/**
 * "What is equin?" — the homepage's map of the project, as three stacked layers
 * joined by arrows: the technical foundations, the applications built on them,
 * and the vision they add up to.
 *
 * Each layer is one click target, opening the page that tells more about it.
 * The three are the same card, so they read as one stack: a flat panel that
 * lifts under the pointer, with a round arrow at the end of its title row that
 * is always visible — so the card says it can be opened before the pointer is
 * anywhere near it, which a hover lift alone cannot (and on a touch screen
 * never does).
 *
 * The stack is capped at 860px inside the reading measure, centred, like the
 * heading above it.

/**
 * "Improve" in the shared site header — the header's one call to action, so the
 * filled pill, with the same sparkle equin's own Improve button wears.
 *
 * It opens a panel hung off its trailing edge (`align="end"`: the button is the
 * last item in the header, so the panel grows back over the page rather than off
 * the side of it). The pill takes the accent fill while the panel is open, which
 * `WebsiteNavLink` reads from the trigger's `aria-expanded`.
 *
 * The draft lives HERE, above the panel, because the panel unmounts when the
 * popover closes: a visitor who clicks away mid-sentence gets their words back
 * when they reopen it. Filing is the one thing that clears it.
 *
 * So does `picking`, because it is the popover that changes while the visitor
 * points at the page: it is taken out of the layout (`hidden`) so the whole page
 * can be picked. Hidden, not closed — closing would unmount the editor, and with
 * it the caret the pick is inserted at. A panel with no box is also out of the
 * picker's hit-testing, and the picker's overlay swallows the presses and the
 * Escape that would otherwise dismiss a popover.
 *
 * `display:none`, not `visibility:hidden`: visibility is inherited AND
 * transitionable, so every `transition-all` control in the panel (every
 * `Button`) would lag the panel by its transition — lingering over the page as
 * the panel hides, and still hidden for a frame when it comes back, which is
 * exactly when the pick focuses the field (a focus that then fails silently).
 * `display` does not transition.
 *
 * On a narrow screen the header runs out of room and moves items into its "⋯"
 * menu. The call to action is the one item that must stay, so it pins itself
 * at full size; the page links give way instead.

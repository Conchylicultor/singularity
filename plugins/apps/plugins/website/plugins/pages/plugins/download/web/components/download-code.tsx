 * Something the reader copies whole — a shell command or a prompt — in a flat
 * panel with one copy button beside it.
 *
 * A `command` is monospaced, on one line that scrolls sideways rather than
 * wraps (a wrapped command reads as two), behind a `$` the copy leaves out. A
 * `prompt` is prose, so it wraps in the body face.
 *
 * Each copy is recorded as a `download_copy_<kind>` analytics event.

 * slot contributions, config and data are the real ones, and an isolated one

 *
 * `exhibit:<id>@<app path>` renders it inside that app's theme boundary
 * (`exhibit:ui-kit/menu-sheet@/agents` — the menus as the agent manager draws
 * them), so a mock of one app's look is compared against that app's real
 * theme rather than the Prototypes app's own.

 * mocks (`<meta name="mocks" content="<kind>:<ref>">`), dispatched to whichever
 * kind plugin handles the tag. A prototype that declares nothing, or declares
 * it malformed, gets the notice saying how to — in the frame, where the author
 * is looking for the comparison. This file names no kind.
 *
 * The declaration is one-directional — the prototype names its counterpart.
 * Prototypes are host-global and outside git while kinds and their catalogs are
 * per-worktree, so the lookup can only ever happen at runtime, and "this
 * worktree has no such thing" is an ordinary answer, not a fault.

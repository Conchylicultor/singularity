    "The prototype detail pane as a canvas of lettered frames: the prototype (frame A reads and writes the shared option picks, every other frame holds its own), each with its own version stepper and options pill, beside frames from contributed sources (FrameSource — the real app, from compare); one canvas-wide size & zoom chip (Responsive / device presets / custom, Fit or 10–200%, Whole page), a drag handle that resizes every frame and snaps to the presets, side-by-side or swipe, keep-only with Undo, link and spread across frames; the whole canvas is remembered per pane for the browser tab's session, so a reload reopens it as it was left while a new pane starts fresh.",

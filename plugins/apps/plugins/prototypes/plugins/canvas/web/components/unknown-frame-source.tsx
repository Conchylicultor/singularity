 * The frame-source dispatch fallback: a frame names a source nothing contributes.

 * canvas names its Real app frame before compare's plugin registers — so it
 * reads `loading`. After, the plugin is really gone (removed, or not in this
 * worktree) and the frame says so. Rendered through
 * the same `children(resolution)` path as a real source, so the frame's chrome
 * is the same — only the sentence differs.
 *
 * Its props are spelled out rather than imported from `slots.ts`, which imports
 * this file: the reverse import would be a cycle.

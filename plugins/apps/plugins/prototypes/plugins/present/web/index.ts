While presenting, hovering shows the frame's tag with its version stepper and 'i of n', Exit, the options pill and the size & zoom chip, and the left and right arrow keys flip through the canvas's frames. A new tab opens present/<id>/<sha|live>/<declared|size word>/<picks?>, a one-frame page carrying the frame's version and own picks. In the canvas header, Open the canvas in a new tab opens the whole canvas (frames, versions, picks, size, zoom, layout, encoded in present-canvas/<id>/<canvas>) chromeless in a new browser tab, so the frames get the whole screen to compare.",

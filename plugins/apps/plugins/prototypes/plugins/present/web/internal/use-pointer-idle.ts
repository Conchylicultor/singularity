 * iframe never reach its parent document. So besides `root`, every same-origin
 * document loaded under it is watched too — found on its `load` (captured at
 * `root`: `load` does not bubble, but it does pass through ancestors' capture
 * phase), which also re-attaches when a frame swaps or reloads its document. A
 * cross-origin frame (a source frame on another origin) cannot be watched; over
 * it the chrome wakes again when the pointer leaves it.
 *
 * Never idle while `hold` (a popup opened from the chrome is showing) or while
 * the chrome is in use (`IN_USE`); the next activity re-arms the countdown.

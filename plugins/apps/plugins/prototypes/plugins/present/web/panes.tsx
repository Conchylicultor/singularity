 *   part, and it must be the last: `picks` needs that place.
 * - `size` — the size the frame opens at: `declared` (the prototype's own
 *   `<meta name="prototype-viewport">`), or a size word (`responsive`,
 *   `window`, `phone`, …). Required for the same reason as `version`.
 * - `picks` — the frame's OWN picks (`a=b,c=d`), so a frame other than A opens
 *   on its variant. Absent, the page reads the shared picks record, as frame A
 *   does.

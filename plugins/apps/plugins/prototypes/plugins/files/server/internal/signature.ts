/**
 * What the prototypes tree looks like right now, one comparable string per
 * prototype folder: every file in it with its size and mtime.
 *
 * This is the answer to "did anything actually change?", and it is what the
 * list re-broadcast is gated on. A watcher event is a hint that something MIGHT
 * have changed — parcel also reports a touch, a chmod, an atomic-save's temp
 * file, and a reconcile tick — and nothing may be re-read for a tree that did
 * not move.
 *
 * Each folder's string is {@link readFolderSignature} — the same one the lister
 * hashes into `PrototypeMeta.rev`, so "the watcher saw this prototype move" and
 * "its live frames reload" are one fact.
 *
 * Per folder rather than one string for the tree, because a prototype's
 * version history cares WHICH prototype moved: the diff of two signatures
 * ({@link changedPrototypes}) is the set whose `dirty` flag may have flipped.

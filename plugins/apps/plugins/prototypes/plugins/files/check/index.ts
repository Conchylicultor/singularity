// The `prototypes:self-contained` check.
//
// Prototypes themselves are NOT checked in: they are throwaway user content
// living in `~/.singularity/prototypes/`, shared by every worktree, backed up by
// the `prototypes` backup source, and validated at read time so their problems
// land on the gallery card instead of blocking somebody's code push.
//
// What remains in the repo is the part that is code, and this check guards both
// halves of that split:
//
//   1. `_template/` — the blank page every prototype is copied from — must
//      itself satisfy the self-contained contract.
//   2. Nothing else may appear in `prototypes/`. A prototype folder committed
//      here is the mistake this check exists to make loud: it would be invisible
//      to every other worktree, would need a merge to be seen, and would live in
//      the code history forever.

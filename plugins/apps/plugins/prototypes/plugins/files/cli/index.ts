/**
 * `prototype` is a GROUP: it routes and never runs. The declaration union makes
 * that exclusive — a group carries `subcommands` and cannot also carry `run` —
 * so `./singularity prototype` printing its own help is a property of the shape
 * rather than a runtime check.
 *
 * Every leaf works straight against the filesystem, never over HTTP, and that
 * is the whole point of having them: the prototypes tree is host-global and
 * outside every checkout, so an agent can mint, enumerate and read or rewind
 * the history of mocks with no backend running and nothing built.
 *
 * This file is reached on EVERY `./singularity` invocation (commander needs the
 * names and flags before it can parse argv), so it imports `defineCliCommand`
 * and nothing else; `mintPrototype`, the lister and the history store sit
 * behind the dynamic `run: () => import(…)`. `cli:command-declarations-light` measures that
 * closure. The generics are pinned so this declaration is checked against each
 * implementation's default export — see `cli/core/internal/command.ts`.

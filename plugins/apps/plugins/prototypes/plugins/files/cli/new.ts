/**
 * `./singularity prototype new [title]` — the terminal spelling of the mint.
 *
 * Calls {@link mintPrototype} straight against the filesystem rather than
 * `POST /api/prototypes`, which is the point of having the verb at all: the
 * prototypes tree is host-global and outside every checkout, so a folder can be
 * minted with no backend running and nothing built. The endpoint and this share
 * the mint, so they cannot produce differently-shaped prototypes.
 *
 * Prints the id first, on its own line: it is what the agent writes into a
 * message (where active-data turns it into a chip) and what names the folder.

 * endpoint and live resource use — it sits in `shared/` precisely so this
 * process can call it — rather than fetching `GET /api/prototypes`. So the verb
 * answers with no backend running, and there is one implementation of "read the
 * metas" rather than a terminal-shaped second one that could disagree with the

 * An empty tree is a legitimate answer (nobody has authored a mock yet), not a
 * failure, so it prints as a sentence instead of nothing at all — a bare empty
 * output would read as "the command is broken".

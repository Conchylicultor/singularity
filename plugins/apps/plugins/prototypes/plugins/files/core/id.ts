// `prototypeIdsIn` all read it from here (`plugins/ids`).
//
// A prototype's id IS its directory name, so the filesystem is the uniqueness
// authority and the mint is a `mkdir` (`shared/mint.ts` re-mints on a
// collision): there is no dir↔id map in front of the routes, the watcher, the
// thumbnail cache or the backup source. It is opaque rather than a slug because
// the folder is minted BEFORE the agent has designed anything — any name chosen
// at that moment is a guess, and renaming later would change the id, which is
// the one thing an id exists to prevent. Nothing is lost to a human: every
// surface that displays a prototype reads `meta.title` out of its `<title>`.
//
// The mint is the `stamped` shape (`proto-<epochSeconds>-<6 base36>`); folders
// minted before it carry a 4-char suffix and stay valid, because recognition is
// the generic body every kind shares, not the current mint's exact shape.
//
// `core/` is browser-importable, so this module stays dependency-free.

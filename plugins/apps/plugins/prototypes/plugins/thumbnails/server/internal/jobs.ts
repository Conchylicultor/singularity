 * Render one prototype's thumbnail.
 *
 * `dedup` by slug, so a burst of saves — or a reconcile racing the watcher —
 * collapses to one render per prototype instead of racing two browsers over
 * the same folder. The payload carries the fingerprint the enqueue was for, so
 * the job can tell it has been superseded.
 *
 * `dedup` has a limit worth naming, because it cost main's queue 70 minutes on
 * 2026-08-17: it cannot collapse onto a row that is already LOCKED. Three saves
 * of one prototype in 14 seconds therefore became three rows, not one — the
 * first running, the next two behind it.
 *
 * `serial: true` is what makes that harmless. One browser at a time is the
 * right bound — a chromium launch plus a render saturates roughly a core, and a
 * gallery open can ask for several prototypes at once — but it must be enforced
 * BEFORE dispatch, not inside the handler. This job used to hold a
 * `createSemaphore(1)` around the browser; a run wedged holding the permit, and
 * the two behind it were dequeued and then blocked *waiting for it*, each
 * burning a worker slot to do nothing. `serial` is graphile's `queue_name`: a
 * job whose queue is busy is never fetched, so it waits in the ready backlog
 * where waiting is free and visible.
 *
 * Known limit, unchanged: this bounds THIS backend, not the host —
 * `browser-fetch` reserves a host-wide pool for its own launches and this does
 * not share it. Fine while prototype renders are rare and short; if galleries
 * get opened across many worktrees at once the fix is a `RESERVED_POOLS` entry
 * in `host-admission/core`, not anything here.
 *
 * `maxAttempts` is left at the default because it only ever governs the
 * UNEXPECTED case: a classified render failure is caught here and becomes a
 * visible state on the card, which is a successful job.

// Three settings, changed by the learner at any time: each chord's state, how
// much of the loop is blank, and how many chords that are off a loop may hold
// besides. It is what the trainer draws its loops, its answer buttons and its
// blanks from, so it is live: a change in one tab changes every open tab. The
// chords alone decide which loops fit, whatever key the song is labelled in.

/**
 * What a chord is to the learner:
 *
 * - `practice` — its boxes can be blank, and it has an answer button (or, when
 *   no track lists it, the Rare button answers it);
 * - `hear` — it can play in a loop, but its boxes are always given;
 * - `off` — a loop holding it plays only as one of the loop's `extras`.

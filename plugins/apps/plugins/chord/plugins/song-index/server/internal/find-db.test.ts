/**
 * The two loop reads, and the skip summary's shape, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * What only a database can show: that `next-chords` and `find` agree — every
 * window `next-chords` credits a chord with is a window `find` returns once
 * that chord is unlocked — and that a jsonb column keeps a list's order while
 * it re-orders an object's keys.
 *
 * The agreement is over the windows (`findLoopsWhere`). `find` also leaves out
 * videos known to be unplayable (`playableVideoWhere`), which the count
 * deliberately does not — see `nextChordsQuery` — so that part is not compared.
 *
 * Requires the running embedded cluster (`./singularity build` first);
 * `createTestDb` throws loudly rather than skipping when it is not up.
 *
 * Run: `./singularity test plugins/apps/plugins/chord`

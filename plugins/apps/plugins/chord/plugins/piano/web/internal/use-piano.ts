 * Lifecycle (the first consumer outside Sonata, so it is spelled out):
 * - **Created on the first chord played**, inside the click that asked for it.
 *   So the samples download only when a chord is first played, and the context
 *   is born inside a user gesture, which is what lets it start running. (A
 *   chord struck by the piano following the song comes from the playhead, not
 *   a click — but the song only plays after the learner pressed Play, and that
 *   earlier activation is what lets the context run.)
 * - **One per screen**: later chords reuse the same context and voices, and the
 *   screen hands this ONE instance to everything that sounds — the chord
 *   buttons, the answer boxes, and the keyboard's own playable keys. A second
 *   `usePiano()` would open a second context beside it. Each new sound cuts the
 *   one before it (`allOff`), so nothing piles up.
 * - **Disposed on unmount**: the voices, then the context.
 * - **One level for everything it plays** (`volume`, 0–1): the chords
 *   following the song and every chord or key the learner strikes.
 *
 * The instrument is read generically from `SonataAudio.Instrument` (the one
 * contribution marked `default`), never by name. A failure — no default
 * instrument, or samples that fail to load — rejects the returned promise.

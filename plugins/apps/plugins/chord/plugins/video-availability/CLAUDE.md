# video-availability

Whether a song's YouTube video still plays in the trainer's embed. About 1
video in 6 in the Sheet Sage dump no longer does, so a loop query that ignored
it would offer a dead loop every sixth time. Design:
`research/2026-09-18-apps-chord-video-availability.md`.

## Using it

```ts
// Server, from the loop query: the status of each video it is about to offer,
// checking over oEmbed the ones nobody has a fresh answer for. Fails open.
ensureVideoStatus(videoIds) → ReadonlyMap<videoId, VideoStatus>

// Filter in SQL: left-join the verdict view, keep a missing row (never checked).
.leftJoin(chordVideoStatus, eq(chordVideoStatus.videoId, …))
.where(or(isNull(chordVideoStatus.status), notInArray(chordVideoStatus.status, [...UNPLAYABLE_STATUSES])))

// The player, once it has tried a video. Answers the status after the report.
POST /api/chord/videos/:videoId/playback  { outcome: "playing" } | { outcome: "error", code }
  → { status: VideoStatus }

// How the videos looked at so far resolve (not the whole index: nothing sweeps).
GET /api/chord/videos/summary → { videos, byStatus: { unknown, ok, gone, not-embeddable } }
```

`VideoStatus` is `unknown` | `ok` | `gone` | `not-embeddable`;
`UNPLAYABLE_STATUSES` is the last two. Nothing calls the playback endpoint yet:
the player belongs to the training-loop step.

## Two sources, one row per video

`chord_videos` is an observation ledger, not a verdict. oEmbed and the player
each own three columns (status, code, checked-at) and write only those, so one
source can never overwrite the other's evidence. A null status is "no answer we
could read"; the code is kept either way. `unknown` is never stored.

**oEmbed** (`https://www.youtube.com/oembed`), measured on 720 video ids from
the dump, 2026-09-17/18:

| Code | Share | What it means | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | 82.2 % | The video is there | `ok` |
| 404 | 15.6 % | Removed or private | `gone` |
| 400 | (rare) | Not a video id at all — a transcriber typed `cheerleader`, which passes as eleven URL-safe characters | `gone` |
| 403 | 2.1 % | Sign-in required / age-restricted: cannot play in an embed | `not-embeddable` |
| 401 | 0.1 % | The owner disabled embedding | `not-embeddable` |
| anything else | — | Throttling, a server fault: says nothing | null (code kept) |

Each 401 and 403 repeated identically on three serial re-checks, so neither is
throttling. oEmbed is cheap and tolerant (~1,000 requests, 12 in flight, no
429). The watch page is never read: scraping it got the machine a
`google.com/sorry` captcha after about a hundred pages.

**The player** (IFrame API `onError`): 100 and 2 → `gone`; 101 and 150 →
`not-embeddable`; `playing` → `ok`; any other code (5, an HTML5 fault) is kept
with a null status. The columns hold the player's last report.

## The verdict: `chord_video_status_v`

A derived view (rebuilt on every boot, no migration). Evidence older than
`EVIDENCE_TTL_DAYS` (90) counts as none. Then:

1. oEmbed says `gone` → `gone`. A removed video is gone whoever played it last
   month.
2. Else the player's answer, when it has one. **The player wins** because
   oEmbed is blind to region blocks and to label videos that refuse playback on
   other sites — of 74 readable oEmbed-`ok` videos none had embedding disabled,
   so the blind spots are exactly what only a player sees. A fresh oEmbed `ok`
   must not resurrect a video the player just failed on.
3. Else oEmbed's answer, else `unknown`.

The status column is decoded through `VideoStatusSchema`, never asserted. The
rule lives only here: `ensureVideoStatus` re-reads the view after its checks
rather than re-deriving the answer.

## No sweep

A video is checked when a loop query is about to offer it and it resolves
`unknown` — never checked, answered with a code that says nothing, or aged past
the TTL. So nothing checks a video nobody will see, there is no backlog and no
burst of traffic to YouTube, and a re-check happens lazily, the next time the
video is offered. (A scheduled sweep would also run only on main:
scheduled jobs install only under `isMain()`, so it would never run on a
release.)

The wave: at most 8 requests in flight across the backend, each bounded to 2 s,
and two queries asking about the same video share one request. A cold batch
costs ~150 ms once. **It fails open**: a request that errors or times out
records nothing and leaves the video `unknown`, and the loop query offers it —
an unreachable YouTube must never empty the trainer. Each such check, and each
code that says nothing, is written to the `chord-video-check` log channel. A
failing database write is not covered: it throws.

## Forks, backups, change feed

`chord_videos` is **kept** in worktree forks and backups: ~13k tiny rows at
most, it holds the player's reports, which nothing can recover, and copying it
spares every worktree the re-checks. It is **excluded from the change feed**: no
live surface reads it (the loop query reads it per call). Remove that exclusion
if one ever does.

No growth bound is declared: rows are minted only for videos a loop query
offered (plus player reports, which are id-validated), which the dump bounds at
~12.7k, and the retention monitor's silencing set must only hold bounds that
are real.

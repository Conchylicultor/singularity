 *   share** (`pickNext` over the pool, against the chords of the last
 *   `SHARE_HISTORY` dealt loops and each chord's `desired` share).
 * - **The pool refills when it runs low**, in parallel: one unfocused batch
 *   (`find` over every chord on, the practised ones, the extras), plus one
 *   focused batch for each of the (at most 2) chords furthest below their
 *   share — so the pool always holds loops that can catch them up. The
 *   sections of the last 20 loops moved past, of the round and of the pool are
 *   left out. Nothing is asked while `desired` is unknown (the progress has not
 *   loaded) or no chord is practised.
 * - **Any change of the chords or the extras empties the pool** behind the

/**
 * Verifies the v2 mailbox model end-to-end against the deployed app:
 *
 *  1. bare `/mail` lands on the ONE threads surface (`/mail/threads`) — no
 *     `/mail/v/*` route survives;
 *  2. the eight mailboxes render as a TAB STRIP, and switching tab re-scopes the
 *     list (each tab's own `filter` is its live window's `where`);
 *  3. each tab renders a genuinely DIFFERENT ROW SET (read off the rows'
 *     `data-thread-id`). This is the assertion that catches the dangling-rule
 *     failure mode: a typo'd fieldId/operatorId lowers to nothing on the
 *     client, and the only visible symptom is every tab showing the same rows;
 *  4. the mailbox scope is an ORDINARY, EDITABLE filter rule — not the locked
 *     chip v1 shipped — and removing it PERSISTS across a reload, landing in the
 *     USER-LAYER config file. That round trip is the whole point of making
 *     mailboxes view instances instead of route params, so it is the assertion
 *     that catches a regression back to v1.
 *
 * Step 3 is destructive by nature (it edits the Inbox tab), so the script
 * finishes by deleting the user-layer override it just created and asserting the
 * authored scope comes back — which doubles as proof that the edit really was a
 * config write, not device-local state.
 *
 * A worktree carries no mail corpus (`mail_threads` is left out of the fork),
 * so against a worktree whose account holds no thread the script seeds its own
 * (`fixture.ts`: 25 Inbox, 2 Sent, 1 Draft) and deletes them at the end; on
 * main it reads the real mailbox and seeds nothing.
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

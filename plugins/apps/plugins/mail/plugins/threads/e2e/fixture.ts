/**
 * Synthetic mail threads for the threads e2e scripts.
 *
 * A worktree's database carries no mail corpus (`mail_threads` is excluded
 * from the fork — sync is main-only), so a script that needs rows seeds them
 * for the connected account, straight into THIS deploy's database, and deletes
 * them when it is done. Every seeded id carries the run's prefix, so cleanup
 * can never touch a real thread; opening a fixture first sweeps what a killed
 * run left behind (every id under the `e2e-` prefix).
 *
 * It refuses main (`singularity`): seeding writes into the database the
 * backend serves, and main's is the user's real mailbox. The account it seeds
 * for is the one the app scopes the list to, read from the `mailAccount` value
 * over HTTP rather than restated as SQL.
 *
 * Postgres is reached through `@plugins/database/core`'s config helpers with a
 * plain `pg.Pool` (the e2e runtime reaches only `core` / `e2e` barrels) — the
 * shape `database/admin/e2e/fork-bench.ts` uses.

 * ordinary `filter` — so switching mailbox is switching tab, and the scope is an
 * editable chip in the Filter pill that the user owns. There is no route param
 * and no server-derived scope: the active view's tree travels the standard
 * filter → live window path like every other rule (the scope of each window
 * tuple is the connected account's id, stated as data), and an edit persists
 * straight back into the config row.

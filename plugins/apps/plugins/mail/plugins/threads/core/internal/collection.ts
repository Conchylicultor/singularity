/**
 * The threads list's live collection: `mail_threads`, read by the DataView as
 * a segmented scroll (`scroll: true`) and kept fresh by the routed change feed
 * — a thread write refills exactly that thread in the segments that hold (or
 * now admit) it, with no revision tick and no refetch of the loaded pages.
 *
 * `filterable` is the ONE declaration of what the list can filter on: the
 * DataView's Filter control offers exactly the fields whose column is here,
 * and the server strict-decodes against it. `labelIds` is the jsonb array every
 * mailbox tab's authored scope is a containment op over (the `labels` field
 * binds it through `MailThreadFieldSpec.column`). `snippet` has no field: it is
 * searched only. `accountId` has no field either: it is the SCOPE the pane
 * states as data (`mailThreadsSource.scoped({ where: { accountId } })`) — a
 * field cannot bind it (`MailThreadColumn` excludes it), and the DataView never
 * offers a scope column to the Filter control, so the user can neither name
 * nor widen it.
 *
 * `labelIds` is not sortable: a jsonb array has no order.
 *
 * `columnScope` is the threads DataView's id (`defineDataView("mail-threads")`,
 * asserted equal at mount): the user's custom columns on that surface sort and
 * filter the window server-side (`custom.<column id>`).

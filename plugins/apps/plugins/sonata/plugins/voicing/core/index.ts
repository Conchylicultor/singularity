/**
 * `@plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/voicing/core` — Sonata's chord-voicing
 * primitives.
 *
 * Pure, framework-free barrel. Owns the voicing engine (`voiceChords`) that turns
 * timed chord events into performed notes, and the per-hand {@link Figuration}
 * registry (the tone-order axis) it walks against a rhythm necklace. Every
 * chord-authoring source feeds its `ChordEvent[]` here, so the chord → notes
 * direction has exactly one home. Imports `score/core` (for `Note`) and
 * `theory/core` (for `chordPitches`), keeping the DAG acyclic.

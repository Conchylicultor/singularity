/**
 * The single chord-note generation chokepoint.

 * annotations under the global voicing config. Run reactively in the shell
 * (before key inference, so chord notes exist for detection), it makes
 * voice-leading an orthogonal modifier applied uniformly to every symbol source
 * — zero per-source code. The shell runs it a second time, after analysis, with
 * `include: "all"` when a song's chord mode is on — so a MIDI song's DETECTED
 * chords become playable notes through the very same voicing + groove.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free: a new `Score` in, a new `Score` out; the input is
 * never mutated.

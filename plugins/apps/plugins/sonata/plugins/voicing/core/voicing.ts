/**
 * The voicing engine: timed chord events → performed notes.
 *
 * The "chord → notes" direction of Sonata's two-layer model. A chord-authoring
 * source authors chord *annotations* (root + quality, timed in quarter-note
 * beats) and this engine *derives* the literal `Note[]` a player can sound and
 * draw — the opposite of the MIDI source, which carries notes directly.
 *
 * This is a shared leaf: any source (chord-grid, Ultimate Guitar, …) feeds its
 * `ChordEvent[]` here, so chord voicing has exactly one home. The caller owns its
 * own track id and note-id namespace via `VoicingOptions`, so two sources never
 * collide on track or note id. Pitch math is delegated to `theory`'s
 * `chordPitches`; *which* tones sound at each onset is delegated to a per-hand
 * {@link Figuration} (the tone-order axis); this engine only places the tone-sets
 * and walks the rhythm necklace.
 *
 * Two paths:
 *  - **No-groove** (`opts.rhythm` absent) — one block note per placed tone per
 *    chord, held for the chord's duration, with a bass root iff `voiceLead`. A
 *    figuration only bites when a rhythm necklace exists, so this path is
 *    byte-for-byte the historical block-chord behaviour.
 *  - **Groove** (`opts.rhythm` present) — two tone-sets are placed per chord (a
 *    voice-led chord register and a low root-position bass register) and each
 *    hand's necklace is walked, calling that hand's figuration per onset.

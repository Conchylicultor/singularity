/**
 * Sonata's app surface. Sonata is a pure full-surface app: the sidebar-less
 * app shell around the full-pane renderer, so the active pane (the library
 * index at `/sonata` or the player at `/sonata/song/:songId`) fills the whole
 * surface and its header — the surface's top chrome — carries the app
 * launcher at its leading edge. Navigation is URL-driven via the pane router —
 * reload / back / forward all persist.
 *
 * The whole surface is ONE player scope (`SonataPlayerScope`: the cursor, the
 * loaded song document, the playback session, the player view, the per-session
 * effects and the per-song setting observers), so each Sonata surface (desktop
 * window / keep-alive tab) gets its own isolated playback state, and a song
 * played from the library keeps playing whichever pane is active. Inside it,
 * the app's own state (the open song) and the app-only effects
 * (`Sonata.Effect`: shortcuts, play history, source persistence).

 *  - TransportEdge (state visual) — capability-filtered, screen-anchored edge-clamped overlays for off-screen transport boundaries (loop A/B edge indicator).
 *  - PitchAxis             — decorations in a display's pitch-axis gutter (the keyboard).
 *  - Hud / ViewOption      — screen-anchored chips over a display, and the per-lens prefs they surface.
 *  - Home                  — the app landing surface (the song library).
 *  - Effect                — headless app-scoped effects.
 *  - Section               — the player's free-floating panels (current-chord readout, …).

 * session its per-session wrappers and effects (`SonataSession.Provider` /
 * `.Effect`), the player its lenses and transport strip
 * (`SonataPlayer.Display` / `.Transport`). The player's header bar is the

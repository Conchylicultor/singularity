 * smplr's default soundfont CDN, pinned to one kit directory. smplr's
 * `Soundfont` loads each instrument from Benjamin Gleitzman's pre-rendered
 * `midi-js-soundfonts` package: `<kit>/<gleitz-name>-<format>.js`. We bake the
 * kit (`MusyngKite` — smplr's default, the better-sounding of the two) into the
 * base so the *remaining* path segment the mirror sees is a single FLAT file
 * name (`flute-mp3.js`), satisfying the asset-mirror route's flat-file
 * constraint (it rejects any `:file` containing `/`). The mirror fetches
 * `<base>/<file>` on a cache miss and serves it same-origin thereafter, so the
 * browser only ever talks to the local server after one warm-up.
 *
 * Format is fixed to `mp3` (see web/voices.ts): mp3 is universally supported, so
 * unlike the piano's ogg/m4a split there is no per-browser format negotiation.

/**
 * Wrap one smplr `Soundfont` instrument (a single General MIDI patch, identified
 * by its gleitz file slug) into the Sonata `InstrumentVoices` contract.
 *
 * smplr@0.26 API used here (verified against `smplr/dist/index.d.ts`):
 *  - factory `Soundfont(ctx, { destination, instrumentUrl, loader })` — callable
 *    without `new` (an `InstrumentFactory`, like `SplendidGrandPiano`).
 *    `instrumentUrl` is a FULL url to one `<gleitz>-<format>.js` soundfont file
 *    (when set, smplr ignores `kit`/`instrument`); `destination` routes output
 *    into the AudioNode; `loader` supplies a `SampleLoader` in place of the
 *    private one the instrument would build — one of smplr's cross-instrument
 *    options, so it is accepted without appearing in `SoundfontOptions`.
 *  - `sf.ready: Promise<void>` resolves when sample loading settles (`.load` is
 *    the deprecated alias).
 *  - `sf.start({ note, velocity, time, duration })` — `note` a MIDI number;
 *    `time`/`duration` are AudioContext seconds (identical to the piano).
 *  - `sf.stop()` stops voices already dispatched to the audio graph;
 *    `sf.scheduler.stop()` flushes smplr's internal lookahead queue (the same
 *    two-layer silencing the piano needs — `Soundfont` shares smplr's scheduler).
 *  - `sf.dispose()` stops all voices, disposes the output channel, and stops the
 *    scheduler (`disconnect()` is the deprecated alias).
 *
 * Samples are served same-origin via the asset-mirror primitive: we point smplr's
 * `instrumentUrl` at `/api/asset-mirror/gm-soundfont/<gleitz>-mp3.js`; the server
 * lazily downloads that file from the gleitz soundfont CDN on first request,
 * caches it under `~/.singularity/cache/asset-mirror/`, and serves it from disk thereafter. So each
 * timbre needs network exactly once (first online play), then sounds fully offline
 * — the browser never talks to the external CDN. Format is fixed to `mp3` (the
 * gleitz CDN's universally-supported encoding), so there is no per-browser format
 * negotiation. The mirror route requires a flat file name, which `<gleitz>-mp3.js`
 * is (the kit directory is baked into `SOUNDFONT_REMOTE_BASE`).
 *
 * Caveat (mirrors the piano): smplr swallows per-sample fetch failures, so an
 * offline-and-never-warmed instrument resolves `load` but is silent; the loud
 * failure signal is the mirror's server-side 502 + log, not a client exception.
 *
 * The engine builds one voice manager per TRACK, so two tracks on the same
 * timbre create two of these. They are given the context's shared `SampleLoader`
 * (the `sample-loader` leaf) for the same reason the piano is — but note that it
 * buys nothing HERE today: `Soundfont` fetches its `<gleitz>-mp3.js` file and
 * base64-decodes every note itself, then hands the finished buffers to smplr, so
 * the loader never sees a URL to cache. Passing it is correct and free, and it
 * starts paying if smplr ever routes soundfont samples through the loader.
 * The `scheduler` is deliberately NOT shared: `allOff` flushes it, and a shared
 * one would flush every other track's queued notes too.

  // methods are safe no-ops (there are no voices left to stop or notes worth

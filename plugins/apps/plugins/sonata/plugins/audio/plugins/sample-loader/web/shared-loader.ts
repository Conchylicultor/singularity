 * `AudioBuffer`s belong to the context that decoded them and cannot be played
 * through another one — or keep every context that ever existed alive through
 * the megabytes of samples cached inside its loader. A `WeakMap` gives each
 * context its own loader and lets the whole pair go when the context does.
 *
 * The PROMISE is cached rather than the resolved loader, so callers racing to
 * create the first loader for a context all join the one in-flight dynamic
 * import instead of each starting their own.

 * piano score creates two `SplendidGrandPiano` instances. Left alone, each
 * builds its own private loader and fetches and decodes the entire sample set
 * for itself. smplr's loader caches decoded buffers by resolved sample URL, and
 * an instrument honours an injected one (`SmplrOptions.loader`, used verbatim in
 * place of the private one it would otherwise build), so one loader per context
 * collapses those N downloads and N decodes into one.

 * both miss the empty cache, and both fetch and decode the whole sample set.
 * Coalescing here is what makes the sharing actually pay.
 *
 * Two callers are only joined when the preset ALONE determines the result, i.e.
 * when neither injects pre-decoded buffers of its own. That exclusion is
 * load-bearing rather than cautious: smplr's `Soundfont` decodes its samples
 * itself and hands them in as `buffers`, under a preset whose `baseUrl` is the
 * empty string and whose sample names are bare note names — so two DIFFERENT
 * soundfont patches covering the same note range describe themselves
 * identically, and joining them would give one patch the other's sound.

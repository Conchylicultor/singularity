 * builds one stable `LivePlayApi` and publishes it here; the playable keyboard
 * (a sibling in a different slot branch) reads it via `useLivePlay()`. Scoping
 * to the `<Provider>` (folded above the whole Sonata subtree via the
 * `Sonata.SurfaceProvider` wrapper slot) keeps two open Sonata surfaces playing
 * independently instead of sharing one module-level singleton.

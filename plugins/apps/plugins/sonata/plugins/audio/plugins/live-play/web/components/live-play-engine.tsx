/**
 * The headless Sonata live interactive player — a `Sonata.Effect`, mounted once
 * inside `SonataProvider` and therefore always mounted while the Sonata app is
 * open; it renders nothing.
 *
 * It turns hand-played key presses (from the playable keyboard) into sustaining
 * note-on/note-off voices, REUSING the engine's shared graph: it routes voices
 * through the published `master` gain (so the master-volume slider governs
 * hand-played notes too) on the same `AudioContext` playback is anchored against
 * — never a second context. The timbre is the DEFAULT instrument, resolved
 * generically via the `Sonata.Instrument` collection API (never naming a
 * contributor).
 *
 * The published `LivePlayApi` is a STABLE object whose methods read refs, so the
 * keyboard can depend on it without churning. The graph + resolved instrument
 * are mirrored through `useLatestRef` and read live inside those methods.

 * A per-surface reactive store sharing the small slice of audio state that
 * crosses the engine ↔ control boundary.
 *
 * The Web Audio graph lives in the headless, always-mounted `AudioEngine`
 * (a `Sonata.Effect`) so no piece of mountable UI can tear the `AudioContext`
 * down. The `VolumeControl` (a `SonataToolbar.End` widget) is therefore decoupled
 * from the graph: the slider *writes* `volume` here and the engine reads it to
 * drive master gain; the engine *writes* `status` / `loadError` here. Either
 * component can mount, unmount, or remount independently.
 *
 * State is scoped per `<AudioStoreProvider>` (folded above both consumers via the
 * `Sonata.SurfaceProvider` wrapper slot) so two open Sonata surfaces have
 * independent volume/status — a module-level singleton would bleed across them.

 * The headless Sonata audio engine — a `Sonata.Effect`, mounted once inside

 * Sonata app is open**, independent of which pane is active or whether the
 * player's section column is collapsed. It owns the Web Audio graph
 * (`AudioContext` + master gain), the per-track channel strips, and the
 * scheduling effect; it renders nothing.
 *
 * Previously this lived inside `AudioPanel` (a collapsible `Sonata.Section`), so
 * collapsing the panel unmounted the component and `ctx.close()`'d the
 * `AudioContext` mid-playback — killing all sound. Splitting the graph into this
 * always-mounted effect makes panel visibility purely cosmetic; the slider and
 * status line now talk to the engine through the per-surface `audio-store`
 * (provided above both via the `Sonata.SurfaceProvider` wrapper slot).
 *
 * On each `isPlaying → true` transition it captures one anchor (`ctx.currentTime`
 * + the cursor beat) and hands it to `startScheduling`, which schedules notes
 * against the Web Audio clock in a bounded look-ahead window (re-arming itself
 * via audio-clock events, never a JS timer / polling) so playback start stays
 * cheap regardless of Score size. Because both the visual rAF cursor and this
 * schedule anchor at the same play instant and derive time from `beatToSeconds`,
 * sound stays locked to the cursor through tempo changes.
 *
 * Instruments and levels are PER-TRACK: there is no global picker here — both
 * the instrument choice and the fader live in the Tracks panel. The engine keeps
 * one CHANNEL STRIP per audible track: a `GainNode` connected to master, fed by
 * a voice manager created into it, with every one of that track's notes routed
 * to it. Two tracks on the same instrument share nothing, and that is precisely
 * what makes a per-track fader possible — a voice manager shared between tracks
 * has a single output node, so there would be nowhere to put one. The strip set
 * derives live from `useTrackInstrumentMap()` + the audible score, so changing a
 * track's instrument mid-session loads the new timbre and re-schedules to play
 * it, in the same gain node, at the same level.

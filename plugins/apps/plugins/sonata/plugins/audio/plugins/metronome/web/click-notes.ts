/**
 * Build the synthetic click track for the continuous metronome, one tiny note
 * per grid cell of `beatGrid(score, subdivision)`. Each click carries one of
 * three accent tiers via its `pitch` sentinel:
 *
 *  - {@link ACCENT_PITCH} — a bar downbeat (only when `accentDownbeat`).
 *  - {@link NORMAL_PITCH} — a main (notated) beat that is not a downbeat.
 *  - {@link SUB_PITCH}    — an in-between subdivision cell (present only when
 *                           `subdivision > 1`), sounded as a lighter, quieter tick.
 *
 * The song's meter always wins: main-beat positions are `beatGrid(score, 1)` and
 * downbeats are `bars(score)`, so the subdivision only *inserts* finer clicks
 * between the notated beats — it never shifts or overrides the pulse.
 *
 * PURE and tempo-INVARIANT: it reads only beat positions (`bars` / `beatGrid`),
 * which `scaleTempo` never touches — so a tempo drag leaves this list unchanged
 * and the engine's `retime` re-times the clicks without rebuilding them.

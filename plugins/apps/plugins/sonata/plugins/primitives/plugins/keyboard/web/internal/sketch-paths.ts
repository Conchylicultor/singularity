 * from. No React, no DOM, no colours — just path strings.
 *
 * Ported from the prototype at `~/.singularity/apps/prototypes/sketch-roll`
 * (`keyRng` / `drawnKeyPath` / `drawnLine`), which is where the numbers were
 * settled. The arithmetic is unchanged; only the 8-positional-number signature
 * became an options object.
 *
 * **Seeded purely from the pitch.** A key's shape is therefore stable across
 * every re-render, every note-on and every remount, with no ref bookkeeping and
 * no cached-shape state anywhere: the same key always redraws as the same
 * squiggle. That is the whole reason the wobble does not shimmer during
 * playback — and it is why this module is the testable half of the skin.

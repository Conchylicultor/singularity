/**
 * The hand-drawn key skin — a decorative SVG layer painted UNDER the keyboard's
 * real key divs, which stay in place as transparent hit targets and label hosts
 * (the same layering `BLACK_FACE` already uses). Nothing here is interactive:
 * the whole layer is `pointer-events-none`, so `usePlayableKeyboard`'s
 * `data-pitch` hit test never sees it and glissando / multi-touch are unaffected.
 *
 * WHY AN SVG AT ALL. The other two skins are CSS gradients on the key divs,
 * which is fine for bevels and useless for an irregular outline — a drawn key
 * has bowed edges and uneven corners, and no box can have those. So the drawn
 * look leaves the divs entirely transparent and paints the keys as paths.
 *
 * ONE `<svg>` PER GROUP, not per key: a single `<defs>` of shading gradients is
 * referenced by all 52 whites or all 36 blacks, so a key costs a handful of
 * paths and nothing else — no per-key svg, no per-key gradient.
 *
 * MEASURED PIXELS, NOT A UNIT BOX. The keys are percentage-positioned divs, but
 * a 0..1 viewBox stretched with `preserveAspectRatio="none"` would scale the
 * wobble and the stroke widths by the (wildly non-uniform) key aspect ratio —
 * horizontal pen strokes would come out fat and vertical ones thin. So the layer
 * measures its own box and builds the viewBox in real px.
 *
 * DEPTH COMES FROM SHADE, NOT BEVELS. A graphite wash down the front of each
 * ivory, a blurred cast shadow where each ebony meets the white beside it, a
 * sheen down the black, and the outline drawn twice, slightly off — SVG has no
 * per-length stroke width, so that overdraw IS the pen pressure.
 *
 * LIGHTING A KEY REWRITES `fill`, NEVER `d`. Every path string is memoized on
 * the geometry alone; the lit tint is a permanently-mounted overlay path whose
 * fill flips between a colour and `none`. A note-on therefore costs one style
 * write per key, with no path re-generation and no element churn.

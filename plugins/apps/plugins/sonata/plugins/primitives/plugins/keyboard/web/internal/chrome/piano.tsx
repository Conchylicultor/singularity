/**
 * The piano chrome — ivory naturals tiling the keybed, ebony accidentals riding
 * the boundaries above them.
 *
 * Key colors. A piano is a physical object — white keys are always ivory,
 * black keys always near-black, the keybed felt always deep red — so every
 * surface color here stays fixed in both light and dark themes rather than
 * tracking the UI's foreground/background tokens (which flip in dark mode and
 * would invert the keys). The lit state tints the key with the theme's accent
 * (`var(--primary)`) or a caller-supplied color via `color-mix()`, layered
 * over the fixed key chrome. Inline styles keep all of this out of the
 * className-only `no-hardcoded-colors` check (the sanctioned escape hatch for
 * physical-object colors).
 *
 * THREE skins, applied to EVERY keyboard render (full roll + readout chips),
 * and all three come from ONE switch — Sonata's look:
 *  - `realistic` — skeuomorphic ivory/ebony: gradients + box-shadow bevels, a
 *    pressed-key depression, and a lit key tinted (translucent) over the ivory.
 *  - `flat` — Synthesia-style: solid fills, no gloss/gradients, strong dark
 *    white-key borders, and a lit key painted in the note's ACTUAL color (the
 *    same color it fell in — no translucent tint washing it out).
 *  - `drawn` — the sketch look's hand-drawn keys, an SVG layer
 *    (`sketch-skin.tsx`); here it only means the key divs go transparent and the
 *    felt strip stands down.
 *
 * There is no second axis to reconcile. The keys used to have their own
 * flat/realistic config alongside the look, but the drawn look never consulted
 * it — paper lane under glossy ivory keys is not a combination worth reaching —
 * so the pair was really one three-valued choice wearing two controls. The skin
 * is now read straight off the look's palette, which is why the unwanted
 * combination has no spelling rather than a rule that suppresses it.
 *
 * Realism (realistic variant) is pure CSS — gradients + box-shadows only,
 * expressed in percentages and 1–2px values so the same chrome scales from a
 * readout chip to the full 88-key roll gutter. Layers, back to front:
 * white keys → red felt strip → black keys.

 * shape that must NOT track the app's shape preset (a "Pill" theme should not

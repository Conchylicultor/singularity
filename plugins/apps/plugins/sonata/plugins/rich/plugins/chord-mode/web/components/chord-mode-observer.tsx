 *
 * It writes only a settled answer: a newly loaded song's settings start
 * pending, so until this song's row arrives nothing renders under the previous
 * song's mode or a stand-in "off" — and a write for a song no longer loaded is
 * dropped. An absent row (`found: false`) IS the song's mode: off.

 * the loaded song, whose score pipeline reads it to re-voice the chords with
 * the groove.
 *
 * It writes only a settled answer: a newly loaded song's settings start
 * pending, so until this song's row arrives nothing renders under the previous
 * song's groove or a stand-in "no groove" — and a write for a song no longer
 * loaded is dropped. A settled `null` — an absent row, or `enabled` off — IS
 * the song's groove: block chords.

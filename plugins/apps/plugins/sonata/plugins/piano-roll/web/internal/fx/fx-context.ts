/**
 * Builds the {@link FxContext} handed to every FX contribution — the bridge
 * between the live scene/app pair and the effect plugins' headless components.
 *
 * Built ONCE per scene (identity-stable across resizes): geometry flows
 * through the `getProjection`/`getLaneSize` ACCESSORS, which the host wires to
 * refs holding the latest values, so effects always read current geometry per
 * tick without the context object ever changing identity (which would force a
 * full effect remount on every lane resize).
 *
 * PARTICLE BUDGET: exposed as a live getter computed from the CURRENT lane
 * area — `min(2000, laneW·laneH / 400)`, floored at 256. The getter (rather
 * than a value snapshotted at build time or mutated on resize) means a read is
 * never stale by construction. Effects read it once at mount to size their
 * fixed-capacity pools; the floor guards the mount-before-first-layout window
 * where the lane still measures 0×0 (a 0-capacity pool would silently disable
 * the effect forever). A later resize doesn't re-size existing pools — pool
 * capacity is a ceiling, and spawns dropping at the old ceiling is acceptable
 * degradation (documented contract on FxContext.quality).

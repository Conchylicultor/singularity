/**
 * The note layer: ONE custom Mesh for ALL notes — 4 vertices / 6 indices per
 * note, a single draw call, uint32 indices (a dense MIDI can exceed the 16k
 * notes that would overflow uint16).
 *
 * Why a mesh and not Graphics/Sprites: the whole point of the GL rewrite is
 * that resize must be O(1), not O(notes). Vertices are authored ONCE per score
 * in AUTHORED space — X in key-fractions (0..1) and Y in authored seconds,
 * exactly the {@link NoteVisual} contract from `geometry.ts` — and the parent
 * container's transform maps them to pixels (`scale = (laneWidth,
 * PX_PER_SECOND)`). A lane resize changes one container scale plus two shader
 * uniforms; the buffers never re-upload.
 *
 * Y-SIGN CONVENTION: quads are authored at y = -seconds (top = -y1Sec,
 * bottom = -y0Sec) with a POSITIVE container scale.y — the same content-space
 * convention as `geometry.ts`'s `beatToY` (y = -seconds × pxPerSec), so the
 * canvas and the DOM overlays share one formula and land pixel-exact.
 *
 * Rounded corners and the inter-note gap are computed in SCREEN PIXELS inside
 * the fragment shader (an SDF rounded-box) from the `uScale`/`uDpr` uniforms —
 * resolution- and DPR-independent with zero per-note CPU work. The fill is FLAT
 * (Synthesia-style): the white-key / black-key shade is baked into the vertex
 * color upstream (`NoteVisual.fillExpr`), so the shader just fills it. This
 * replaces the DOM version's `rounded-sm border shadow-sm` + the `w-1/h-1`
 * inset.
 *
 * ONE shader pair carries BOTH looks behind the `uSketch` flag — the flat bar
 * above, and the sketch look's hand-drawn pen (the same SDF, displaced by seeded
 * fbm and stroked). Not two `Shader` objects: that would be four sources to keep
 * in agreement instead of two, a pipeline compile the first time a user toggles,
 * and two shaders sharing one `UniformGroup` to `destroy()` carefully. The flat
 * path returns before a single instruction of the pen runs.
 *
 * The shader is authored twice (GLSL for WebGL, WGSL for WebGPU — Pixi v8's
 * dual-backend requirement) and the two sources are kept structurally parallel,
 * statement for statement, so a reader can diff them by eye; that discipline is
 * the only thing limiting drift between them.

//
// Vertex: standard Pixi v8 mesh transform (projection × world × local) with the
// quad's corner UV, authored size, and color passed through. Pixi auto-binds
// `uProjectionMatrix`/`uWorldTransformMatrix` (globals) and `uTransformMatrix`
// (local) for GL; for WGSL the `globalUniforms`/`localUniforms` binding NAMES at
// groups 0/1 are load-bearing — Pixi's mesh pipe auto-assigns those bind groups
// only when the reflected layout declares them.
//
// The vertex stage also carries the SKETCH look's two preparations, both exact
// no-ops under the digital looks (where uMargin is 0): it hashes the note's own seed,
// and it grows the quad by uMargin CSS px per side so the pen may write outside
// the note box. Neither costs a byte of geometry — see the comments in-shader.
//
// Fragment: maps the corner UV to a position in CSS pixels (sizePx = aSize ×
// uScale), shrinks the box by 0.5px per side (the DOM drew notes at w-1/h-1 — a
// 1px gap between adjacent notes), rounds corners at min(4px, half the min
// dimension), fills FLAT with the (already-shaded) vertex color, and
// anti-aliases over one PHYSICAL pixel (CSS px × 1/uDpr). Output is
// premultiplied alpha (Pixi's blend convention). Under the sketch look the same
// SDF is instead displaced by seeded fbm and drawn with a pen — one branch on
// uSketch, taken after the flat path has already returned.

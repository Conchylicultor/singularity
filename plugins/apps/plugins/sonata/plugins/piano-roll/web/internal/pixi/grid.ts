/**
 * Grid layers for the canvas piano roll: time-axis BAR LINES and pitch-axis
 * PITCH LINES — the canvas replacements for the DOM `GridLines`/`OctaveLines`
 * components.
 *
 * Two different spaces, mirroring the DOM version's layering:
 *
 *  - Bar lines scroll with the notes, so they live in CONTENT space (authored
 *    units: x in 0..1 key-fractions, y = -seconds) under the content-scaled
 *    container. A line is a filled rect of height 1/PX_PER_SECOND seconds —
 *    scale.y is the constant PX_PER_SECOND, so it renders exactly 1px at any
 *    lane size. Built ONCE per score; resize never redraws it.
 *
 *  - Pitch lines mark a fixed pitch axis, so they are SCREEN-space (a direct
 *    stage child): vertical 1px lines at the natural white-key boundaries
 *    (B–C octave splits, plus the E–F mid-octave split), at each boundary key's
 *    left-edge fraction × laneWidth, full lane height. Octave (B–C) lines render
 *    stronger than the mid-octave (E–F) lines. Redrawn on resize only.
 *
 * Color: both layers draw WHITE geometry and carry a tint + per-layer alpha
 * taken from the active LOOK (`SonataLookStyle["grid"]`), never from the theme.
 * The lane is a fixed stage — Synthesia-dark under the digital looks, cream paper under
 * `sketch` — in every theme, so the grid is theme-independent by design and not
 * the `var(--border)` token (which would vanish on the dark lane under a dark
 * theme). A look is NOT a theme: it swaps which fixed palette this handle is
 * pinned to, which is why the ink is STORED here — `refreshColors` (a theme
 * flip) re-resolves the stored expression and cannot clobber an active look.
 * Both remain tint/alpha writes plus, for a dashed rule, one pitch-line redraw.

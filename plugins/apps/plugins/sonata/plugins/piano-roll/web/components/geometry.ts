/**
 * The piano roll's coordinate model — pure, framework-free, so the renderer and
 * the published `Projection` share ONE source of truth. The roll is VERTICAL,
 * Synthesia-style:
 *
 *  - X (pitch): the range A0–C8 laid across the container width by the ACTIVE
 *               keyboard layout (see the `pitch-layout` plugin) — a piano's
 *               tiled naturals and boundary-riding accidentals, or Jankó's
 *               uniform pads. The roll holds no key formula of its own: it is
 *               handed one `PitchPlane` and reads its `columns`, the same pads
 *               the keyboard below renders, so every note lands exactly on its
 *               key. A pitch the plane does not carry has no column, and is
 *               DROPPED rather than drawn at a fabricated position.
 *  - Y (time):  the time axis is anchored in AUTHORED (base-tempo) seconds and
 *               lives in CONTENT-SPACE (cursor-invariant):
 *               y = -seconds(beat) * pxPerSecond, where
 *               pxPerSecond = PX_PER_SECOND * tempoScale. The incoming `score`
 *               already has `tempoScale` folded into its tempo map
 *               (seconds = authoredSeconds / tempoScale), so multiplying by
 *               tempoScale here cancels it: a note's pixel HEIGHT is its authored
 *               duration and never changes with tempo. What tempo changes is the
 *               SCROLL SPEED — the cursor sweeps wall-clock seconds at 1×, so the
 *               roll scrolls at PX_PER_SECOND * tempoScale px/sec: slow the tempo
 *               and the whole roll scrolls slower instead of notes stretching.
 *               The per-frame scroll is NOT baked into the geometry — the display
 *               applies it as a single `translateY(offset)` on one layer, where
 *               `offset = height + seconds(cursorBeat) * pxPerSecond` maps the
 *               cursor to the lane bottom (the keyboard). Because the cursor never
 *               enters the geometry, the projection (and every note rect) is stable
 *               while playing; only the layer's transform moves. Layout is a pure
 *               function of the score + lane width + tempoScale — no per-frame
 *               React state.
 *
 * A note rectangle spans from its end (top, further in the future) to its onset
 * (bottom), and is as wide as its key. `noteToRect` is the canonical note
 * geometry both the renderer and overlays consume.

 * the same speed). Unlike `tempoScale` — which scales the scroll RATE but cancels
 * out of note heights — `spread` scales EVERYTHING, including heights, which is
 * exactly the "taller notes" zoom. The live value is ephemeral transport state
 * (the Sonata context). `SPREAD_MIN` is the DEFAULT zoom-out floor and the

/**
 * Every look the Sonata roll can be drawn in, in picker order — the lane, the
 * grid, the falling notes, and the keys below them, all from one switch.
 *
 *  - `flat`      — the Synthesia stage with flat keys: a dark lane, faint white
 *                  rules, opaque note bars, and keys as solid fills with strong
 *                  dark borders, a lit key painted in the note's actual colour.
 *                  The default.
 *  - `realistic` — the same stage under skeuomorphic ivory/ebony keys:
 *                  gradients, bevels, gloss, and a pressed-key depression.
 *  - `sketch`    — the whole roll as a drawing on paper: cream ground with a
 *                  paper grain, graphite rules, notes inked by a wobbling pen,
 *                  and hand-drawn keys.
 *
 * ONE axis, on purpose. This used to be two — a `digital`/`sketch` look and the
 * keyboard's own `flat`/`realistic` key style — but they were never independent:
 * paper lane under glossy ivory keys is not a combination worth reaching, so the
 * drawn look simply never consulted the key style. Three of the four pairs were
 * reachable, which is to say it was always one axis with three values wearing two
 * controls. Naming it as one leaves the unwanted pair with no spelling at all,
 * rather than a row that sits in the popover doing nothing.
 *
 * This array is the single source: {@link SonataLook} is derived from it, so the
 * palette table, the picker's options and the {@link asSonataLook} narrowing
 * cannot list different looks.

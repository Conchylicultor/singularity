/**
 * Captures the roll in whichever look is active, and asserts the thing a look
 * change can actually break: that the Pixi scene still mounts and paints.
 *
 * Run it once per look to get the pair — the switch itself lives in the View
 * popover (`Sonata.ViewOption` → `FieldRenderer`), and driving it from here
 * would be testing Playwright's ability to find a combobox rather than testing
 * the roll:
 *
 *   ./singularity build
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/look/e2e/look-verify.ts --out /tmp/flat
 *   # switch Look → Sketch in the app
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/look/e2e/look-verify.ts --out /tmp/sketch
 *
 * `--song` takes a song id, NOT a library card to click: the cards' actions are
 * hover-revealed, so a click-through has to hover first and still races the
 * DataView's own load — and when it silently lands on a text node instead, the
 * run fails much later at the canvas wait, pointing at the wrong thing. A song
 * URL is the stable entry point. It just needs a generous wait, because a cold
 * player parses the MIDI, boots Pixi and installs three bitmap fonts before the
 * first frame.

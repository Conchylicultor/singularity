/**
 * Background playback for the library: play a song in place (no navigation) by
 * hydrating every registered source's raw, loading it into the surface's player
 * (`useLoadDocument` + `setCurrentSong`), then arming `requestPlayOnLoad` so
 * playback starts as soon as the recomposed score is ready. Because the player
 * scope (and with it the audio engine) is mounted above the pane router, the
 * song keeps playing while the user stays on the gallery/table.
 *
 * `togglePlaySong` is play/pause-aware: clicking the already-current song
 * toggles it (resume/pause from the live cursor, no reload); clicking a
 * different song loads + auto-plays it from the top. Stable identity
 * (`useEventCallback`) so it can be passed to memoized rows; the returned
 * `currentSongId`/`isPlaying` are reactive so callers re-render their icon.

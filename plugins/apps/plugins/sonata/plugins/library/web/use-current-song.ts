 * `error` (with the row as last seen, as `stale`) when the read failed;
 * `found: false` when no song is loaded (determinate at once — nothing is
 * read), or the loaded id is no longer a song (deleted). THE read path for the open song's title — the shell context
 * deliberately keeps no copy.
 *
 * Neither `loading` nor `error` is ever collapsed into "no song": callers
 * branch on `status`, so an inline-editable title is only ever seeded from a
 * ready row.

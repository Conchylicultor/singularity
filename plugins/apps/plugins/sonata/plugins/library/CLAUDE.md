# library

## Navigation (the Sonata panes live here)

Sonata navigation is URL-driven via the pane router — this plugin owns both
panes (it is the natural owner: it already holds `useSongLink`, the
`Library.Source` registry, and contributes `Sonata.Home`; the shell can't own
them without a `shell → library` import that would cycle with the existing
`library → shell` dependency on `useSonataApp`).

- `sonataLibraryPane` — index pane at bare `/sonata` (`appIndex: true`,
  standard chrome titled "Library"). Renders the gallery via
  `Sonata.Home` inside `PaneChrome`.
- `sonataPlayerPane` — player pane at `/sonata/song/:songId;bar;view`. Both
  are keyed (named) views of the song, absent by default: `;bar=12` opens it
  with the playhead at that bar (`sonataSongLink(id, bar)`), and `;view` is the
  display lens (`…;view=notation`, absent for the default lens) — the surface
  wraps its chrome in the player's `PlayerDisplayBinding`, so the header's
  display switcher writes it in place and a reload, bookmark or shared link
  reopens the same lens. Its own header
  slot (`sonataPlayerPane.Actions`) IS the player's header — ← Library, the song
  title as the pane's title item, then the tools: the speed wheel, metronome,
  transpose, volume, the spread (zoom) wheel and, far right, the display
  switcher — rendered by `PaneChrome` as one overflow-collapsing row. Playback
  is the transport strip at the body top, above the display (`PlayerTransport`:
  play / pause, the scrubber, loop — the `SonataPlayer.Transport` slot). **This plugin's barrel is where every other Sonata plugin reaches
  that header**: it exports `sonataPlayerPane`, and a control is contributed as
  `sonataPlayerPane.Actions({ id, component })`. Which side of the row an item
  lands on is the slot's reorder config
  (`config/apps/sonata/library/sonata-player.actions.jsonc`), not a field on the
  contribution.
  Carries the optimistic title in `input`; its `resolve` hook
  (`useSonataPlayerResolve`) hydrates every `Library.Source`'s raw for the song
  and loads it (`useLoadDocument({ kind: "library", songId }, rawMap)`) — so
  direct nav / reload restores it — and gates on the song existing. A song
  already loaded (playing in the background, reopened from the now-playing bar)
  is NOT reloaded: a reload would rebuild its timeline and the session's content
  reset would stop and rewind it. The surface composes the player parts
  (`PlayerTransport`, `PlayerDisplay`) with the `SectionPane`.

`useSongLink` opens the player with `openPane(sonataPlayerPane, { songId },
{ mode: "root", hint: { title } })`. The ← Library button calls `clearRoute()`
(empty route → the index pane), which also works for deep-linked players. The
shell mounts `<FullPane/>`, which paints the active pane full-surface.

## Create affordances (`Library.Source.createOption`)

Each input source contributes its "add a song" affordance as a plain-data
`createOption: CreateOption` (the data-view create type) on its `Library.Source`
contribution — **not** a React component. `SongLibrary` maps every source's
`createOption` into the `DataView`'s `creators` prop, which renders them as a
toolbar "+" menu (N sources → menu, not a trailing card). The library stays
source-agnostic: it threads an opaque `s.createOption` and never names MIDI.

Because a `CreateOption.onSelect` is plain data (no component, no hooks), the
open-after-create step can't use the `useSongLink` hook. Sources call
`openSongImperative(song)` instead — the imperative twin exported from this
plugin's web barrel (`open-song.ts`), which writes to the live pane store via the
imperative `openPane` (mirroring `useSongLink`'s exact `mode:"root"` + `input`
call). `useSongLink` is kept for `SongLibrary`'s `rowActivation`, which runs
inside a component where the caller-aware context store is correct.

## One surface, no bespoke card

The library has NO custom card component. The gallery builds the shared
`DataCard` from the same `FieldDef` schema the table uses, plus a `leading`
music-note block (`viewOptions.gallery.leading`). Everything a card wants is
declared once on the `<DataView>` and honoured by both views:

| Affordance | Where it is declared |
|---|---|
| Play / Pause, Delete | `Library.SongActions` contributions (Play carries `zone: "persistent"`, so it is painted at rest) |
| Ring on the loaded song | `selectedRowId={currentSongId}` |
| Opening a song | `onRowActivate` |
| Anything per-song another plugin knows | a `Library.Fields` field extension |

Which fields the CARD shows is authored config, not code — `visibleFields` on
the `cards` row of `config/apps/sonata/library/sonata.library.jsonc`. Leave it
unauthored and every contributed field stacks another caption row.

## The section column (`SectionPane`)

`Sonata.Section` is a
[detail-sections](../../../../../primitives/plugins/detail-sections/CLAUDE.md)
slot — read that first; it owns the card chrome, the persisted per-section open
state, and the `useAvailable` gate. Sonata-specific on top of it:

- `web/components/section-pane.tsx` owns only the **column**: the
  collapse-to-rail toggle, the scroll body, and two `area`-filtered zones
  (`"editor"` above `"player"`). Each section is painted by the primitive's
  `SonataSectionItem`.
- **A collapsed card's body is unmounted**, so per-song work that must outlive
  the panel lives in a headless `Sonata.Effect` — hence the chord-grid / Ultimate
  Guitar `*PersistObserver`s and `rhythm-controls`' `RhythmObserver`.
- The shell exports the shared `useAvailable` gates `useHasChords` /
  `useHasDerivedChord` / `useHasVoicedChords`.

## The song list (`songLibrary`)

`songLibrary` (`core/resources.ts`, key `"sonata.songs"`) is a `liveCollection`
over `sonata_songs` — H 100, M 500, default order `createdAt desc` — declared
`scroll: true` (the library DataView reads it as live key-range pages through
`songLibrarySource`, `web/source.ts`, searching title and composer) and
`contributed: true`. Served by `songLibraryServed` (`serveCollection(songLibrary,
{ from: _songs })`), which compiles at boot once the contributions are collected.

- **Contributed columns.** Other plugins add columns to every row — the library
  names none of them. Each declares a `liveColumns` handle in its core and serves
  it over its entity extension (`LiveColumns.Serve(serveColumns(handle, { join:
  ext.join(alias) }))`): playback-history's `playback.playCount` /
  `playback.lastPlayedAt`, the MIDI source's `midi.trackCount` /
  `midi.sourceMissing`. A row carries them under `$columns` (`Song` is
  `WithContributedColumns<SongRow>`), each contributor's `Library.Fields` field
  reads its slice with `handle.read(song)` and binds `handle.column(…)`, so the
  list sorts and filters by them on the server — "Most played", "Recently
  played" and "Unplayed" keep their meaning (a never-played song reads its
  extension default, `playCount = 0`). A play refills exactly that song in the
  tuples that read the join.
- **Field → column.** A library field whose id is not its column binds it:
  `duration` → `durationSec`, `added` → `createdAt`. Field ids stay the persisted
  vocabulary (saved views, presets).
- **Readers.** `SongLibrary` (the DataView; a `useLive(songLibrary, { limit: 1
  })` probe decides the first-run onboarding — settled with no row — and
  otherwise the DataView owns its skeleton and errors); `useCurrentSong`, the
  player title (`useSongTitle`) and its resolve gate (`useSonataPlayerResolve`)
  each read ONE row with `useLiveRow(songLibrary, id)`, whose rows carry
  `$columns` too.
- **Behaviour under a live source.** Nulls sort last in both directions (the
  keyset rule; the nullable sortable columns are `composer`,
  `playback.lastPlayedAt` and `midi.trackCount`), an enum sort or group
  (`source`, the cards view's sections) reads in stored-value order, a section's
  count is exact only once a later section has started in the loaded rows or
  the scroll has read to the end (a library past one window, 100 songs, shows
  its last loaded section as `n+` until then).
- **Custom columns sort and filter server-side.** `songLibrary.columnScope` is
  the library DataView's id (`sonata.library`, asserted at mount), so a
  user-defined custom column binds as `custom.<id>` (the `custom` scoped column
  set — P3 of `research/2026-09-29-global-scoped-change-routing.md`), which
  lifted P2's accepted regression.

## Song title ownership

`sonata_songs.title` has exactly **one** client-side owner: this plugin's
`songLibrary` collection. There is no shell-context mirror of it. Anything that
needs the open song's title reads it through `useCurrentSong()` (the canonical
row for `currentSongId`, one `useLiveRow` point read, preserving the `status`
arms (loading / error / ready)), and the title is *edited* in exactly one place — the inline
`SongTitle` field, which is the player pane's TITLE node
(`title: { component: SongTitle }` on its `Pane.define`, `web/components/song-title-field.tsx`) and
patches `PATCH /api/sonata/songs/:id`
via `updateSong`. Mirroring the `PageHeader` pattern, the loading and error arms
gate the mount so `useEditableField` only ever seeds from a ready title, and an
empty/whitespace-only draft is never persisted (re-mounting re-seeds from the
canonical value). Source editors (chord-grid, ultimate-guitar) no longer write
the title — a chord-grid save endpoint physically cannot carry one.

## Plugin reference

- Description: Source-agnostic song library landing for Sonata. Renders the gallery of saved songs (via Sonata.Home) and opens a song into the player by collecting every source's raw through the Library.Source registry. Sources contribute persistence/hydration + their own add affordances. Persists source-agnostic Sonata song rows (generic metadata) and serves the `sonata.songs` live collection (sortable and filterable by the columns other plugins contribute). Per-source raw lives in each source's own entity-extension; sources create songs via the exported `createSongRow` helper.

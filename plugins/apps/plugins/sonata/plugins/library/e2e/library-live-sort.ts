/**
 * The Sonata library sorts and filters by columns OTHER plugins contribute
 * (playback-history's play stats) on the server, and follows their writes
 * live.
 *
 *  1. opens the library's "All" table and applies the "Recently played" sort
 *     preset (`lastPlayedAt desc`, a contributed column);
 *  2. records a play of a song that is NOT at the top — through the API, as a
 *     second tab's player would — and asserts the song moves to the top of the
 *     open table, without a reload, with its Plays cell counting the new play;
 *  3. applies the "Unplayed" filter preset (`playCount = 0`) and asserts it
 *     lists songs, every one of them "Not played yet" (a never-played song has
 *     no playback row: the join reads the extension's default, 0), and not the
 *     song just played.
 *
 * The preset clicks write the "All" view's sort and filter into this deploy's
 * library view config; the harness's agent-write ledger (`withBrowser`) puts
 * the file back when the run ends. The play is real: the song keeps it — so
 * the script refuses main (`singularity`), whose play stats are the user's,
 * and runs against a worktree deploy, whose database is a throwaway fork.
 *
 * It reads the whole library in one window (`limit` = the collection's
 * `maxLimit`, 500) to pick its target and count the never-played songs, and
 * refuses a larger library rather than reason over a partial one. The
 * Unplayed count is compared exactly only while it fits on screen (rows past
 * the viewport, or past the first page, are not rendered).
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/library/e2e/library-live-sort.ts [--headed]

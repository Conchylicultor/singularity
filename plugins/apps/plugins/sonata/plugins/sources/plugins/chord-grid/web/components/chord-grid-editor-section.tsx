/**
 * In-player editor for a chord-grid song, contributed to `Sonata.Section`
 * (`area: "editor"`). Mounts the `ChordGridLoader`, writing edits straight into
 * the context (`setSourceRaw` → live score recompile).
 *
 * This component no longer persists or gates:
 * - **Persistence** lives in the headless, always-mounted
 *   `ChordGridPersistObserver` (`Sonata.Effect`). It must stay outside this body
 *   because the section body is unmounted while its card is collapsed, so an
 *   in-body debounced save would be dropped on collapse.
 * - **Visibility** is the contribution's `useAvailable` gate (raw defined ⇒ this
 *   is a chord-grid song), so the card never appears for other sources.
 *
 * Because the gate guarantees the raw is defined by the time this renders, a
 * missing raw here is a genuine invariant violation — we throw loudly rather than
 * paper over it with a non-null assertion or a silent `null`.

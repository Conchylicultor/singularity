// 1 row per song — its primary key IS the song — so it is a lookup-only
// collection: nothing lists every song's alignment, so it mints
// `sonata-ug-alignment:rows` alone. A reader takes its row with
// `useLiveRow(ugAlignmentRows, songId)`; `found: false` is "this song never had
// a video".
//
// Bounded by construction: only an open UG song subscribes (the sync effect and
// the Recording section), a load is one primary-key seek, and the `:rows` point
// routing schedules a job's write for the one song whose row it named.

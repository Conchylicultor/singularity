/**
 * The UG sheet of a song changed (`sonata.ug.tabSaved`, on create and on every
 * content edit):
 *
 * - A song with no alignment row yet (just imported) gets one owned by the
 *   resolver (`pick: "auto"`, `queued`): the job will find it a video.
 * - A song with a video, or whose video the resolver owns, is handed to the
 *   job, which re-aligns the chosen video (or re-tries the candidates of one
 *   that needs a video) when the sheet really moved.
 * - A song whose user cleared nothing to align to is left alone.
 *
 * A plain job in between because a supervised job takes no event payload —
 * and deciding here keeps a song with nothing to do from spawning a child.

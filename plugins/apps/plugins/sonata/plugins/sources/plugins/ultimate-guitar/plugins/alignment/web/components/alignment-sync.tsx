/**
 * Headless, always-mounted bridge from the alignment's live row to the UG raw
 * (`Sonata.Effect`): when a job lands, the applied record is written into
 * `raw.alignment`, so the Score recompiles onto the recording's beats.
 *
 * What is written is `appliedAlignment` — the rule `hydrate` applies too: the
 * row's record when it was made for the row's video (or is the resolver's best
 * try, with none chosen) and the open sheet, whatever its score — else `null`
 * (another video's or sheet's record, no record, no row).
 * A re-align queued or running keeps the current alignment playing until its
 * result lands. The comparison is by value, so the raw changes (and playback
 * resets) at most once per finished job — not on every status write, and not
 * after `hydrate` already opened the song aligned. A row still loading or unreadable leaves the raw as
 * hydrated; the Recording section shows why.
 *
 * Lives outside the Recording section because a section body unmounts while
 * collapsed. The UG persist observer ignores a change of `raw.alignment`, so
 * this write is never saved as a sheet edit.

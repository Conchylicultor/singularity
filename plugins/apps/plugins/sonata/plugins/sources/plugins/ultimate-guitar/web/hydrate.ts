/**
 * Hydrate a song's UG source: fetch the persisted `UgTab` and its alignment
 * together and hand them back for `useLoadDocument` (keyed under `"ultimate-guitar"`),
 * so an already-aligned song opens aligned — no recompile-and-reset when the
 * alignment's live row arrives a moment later. The record goes in by the same
 * rule the alignment child's sync effect applies (`appliedAlignment`: made for
 * the row's video — or its best try when none was chosen — and this sheet,
 * whatever its score).
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for a song that carries no UG tab, so it's skipped in the
 * library's generic collection — and the UG editor section stays hidden for it.

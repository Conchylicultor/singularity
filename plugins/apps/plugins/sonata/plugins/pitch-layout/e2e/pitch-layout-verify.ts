/**
 * Asserts the two things a pitch layout can actually break, in whichever layout
 * is active: that the keybed under the roll holds the pads that layout declares,
 * and that each pad is still the thing the pointer lands on.
 *
 * It identifies the active layout from the PAD COUNT rather than by driving the
 * View popover — a run therefore never depends on Playwright finding a combobox,
 * and it reports which layout it saw instead of assuming one. Run it once per
 * layout to get the pair (and once per look for the full six):
 *
 *   ./singularity build
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/pitch-layout/e2e/pitch-layout-verify.ts --out /tmp/piano
 *   # switch Keyboard layout → Jankó in the View popover
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/sonata/plugins/pitch-layout/e2e/pitch-layout-verify.ts --out /tmp/janko
 *
 * `--song` takes a song id, NOT a library card to click: the cards' actions are
 * hover-revealed, so a click-through has to hover first and still races the
 * DataView's own load. A song URL is the stable entry point, and it needs a
 * generous wait because a cold player parses the MIDI, boots Pixi and installs
 * three bitmap fonts before the first frame.

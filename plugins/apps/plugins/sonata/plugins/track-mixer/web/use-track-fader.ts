/**
 * The write policy behind one track's fader.
 *
 * Three separate problems, which is why this is a hook and not three lines in
 * the row:
 *
 * **1. The thumb must follow the pointer.** A slider bound straight to the
 * persisted level lags by a round trip on every frame, which feels like the
 * fader is stuck in treacle. So the position on screen comes from local draft
 * state, and the server is told about it separately.
 *
 * **2. The write is throttled leading + trailing, never debounced.** A drag
 * fires a change event per frame. A trailing-only debounce — the reflex fix —
 * never fires at all during a continuous drag, because there is always another
 * event before the timer expires; the user would hear nothing until they
 * stopped moving. A throttle writes immediately on the first change and then at
 * most once per interval, so the audio moves *with* the fader, and its trailing
 * edge guarantees the value the user let go on is the one that lands.
 *
 * **3. The draft is held until the resource echoes it back.** The live-state
 * row is still the pre-drag value for as long as the write is in flight, so
 * dropping the draft at pointer-up would snap the fader back to where it
 * started and then jump forward again when the push arrived. The draft is
 * therefore held until the server reports the value we last sent. If the write
 * fails it never does, and the user's position simply stays on screen — the
 * repo's never-revert policy for local edits: losing a fader move because a
 * request 502'd is worse than showing a level the DB does not yet agree with.
 *
 * A value that arrives having been set by something *else* — the per-song reset
 * button, another surface — is adopted immediately instead, so an outside
 * change is never masked by a draft that is waiting for an echo it will not get.
 *
 * (`primitives/editable-field` is this same shape for text: debounced autosave
 * plus echo reconciliation. It does not fit here — it is `T extends string` and
 * carries caret mapping, neither of which means anything for a number — and
 * generalizing it is a separate piece of work, not this one.)

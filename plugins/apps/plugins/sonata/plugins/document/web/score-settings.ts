 * The per-song settings the document's score pipeline transforms the loaded

 * import (cycle), so the document DEFINES the setting — its identity, value
 * type and `absent` value — and the feature plugin registers it
 * (`SonataDocument.SongSetting`) with the observer that settles it; its
 * controls read and write it through `useSongSetting` / `useWriteSongSetting`.
 * Feature plugins depend on the document, never the reverse.
 *
 * This is the only place the document names them, and only because the
 * pipeline reads their VALUES. What the score waits for is not this list: it is every
 * setting the composition registers (`useSettledSongSettings`), so a
 * composition without one of these features loads without hanging, and the
 * pipeline reads that setting's `absent` value — the identity transform.

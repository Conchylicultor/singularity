/**
 * Which song a document is. A union, so a file opened for preview can never be
 * mistaken for a library song — and so nothing persisted per library song
 * (settings, play counts) can be read or written for a file:
 *
 *  - `library`: a saved Sonata song. Its per-song settings are persisted by
 *    their feature plugins and settled by the registered observers.
 *  - `file`: content read from a file outside the library (`key` names the
 *    file, e.g. its file-ref key). It has no persisted settings: every setting
 *    reads its `absent` value, and no setting can be written.

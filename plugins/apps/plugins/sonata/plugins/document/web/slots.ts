  // (keyed on the load), so an observer reads the non-null `useMountedSongId()`
  // and starts from that song's own state. The score waits on exactly the
  // settings registered here — read generically, so the document names no
  // feature, and a composition without one of them never waits on it. A file
  // document mounts no observer: every setting reads its `absent` value. One
  // contribution per setting.

 *  - `failed`: content is loaded but one of its settings could NOT be read

  //  - transpose: the global offset in semitones, applied early in `baseScore`

  //    audio, roll geometry, overlays, key readout — transposes for free;
  //  - key auto-detect: when on, the pipeline ignores the authored key and

  //  - groove: the two-hand rhythm necklace plus each hand's tone-order
  //    figuration id, threaded into `reVoiceChords`. Like voicing, it lands notes
  //    on the chord annotations' EXISTING beats (a bar-anchored groove over the
  //    same timeline), so it belongs in the view layer and never rewinds the
  //    transport. `null` ⇒ block chords;

  //    chord analysis, so the analyzer-derived chords of a MIDI song become
  //    playable notes on the Chords / Bass tracks — through the same voicing
  //    config + groove a chord grid uses. A view transform: it lands notes on the
  //    chords' existing beats and never rewinds the transport;

  //    the pipeline, but part of the gate.

  // session's reset keys on — and the split is load-bearing precisely because a
  // view-transform *physically cannot* live in this memo, so it can never
  // re-trigger the rewind. A source that authors no tempo/time-sig (e.g. the
  // chord grid emits empty maps) defers to one that does via `mergeScores`'
  // first-non-empty rule — so a merged MIDI file owns the timeline here.
  //
  // Its input is the sources that HOLD input for this document, kept as one

  // re-key the content — that would rewind and stop a session already playing.

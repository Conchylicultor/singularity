/**
 * Drives the deployment pane's Test-locally section and the deployments row's
 * serve shortcut against the deployed app.
 *
 * Manual only (nothing runs this automatically):
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/deploy/plugins/local-serve/e2e/local-serve-verify.ts [--headed]
 *
 * It reads the first deployment out of the running app rather than seeding one,
 * for the same reason the remote-deploy script does: a deployment names a real
 * remote host.
 *
 * It never presses **Serve**. That kicks a full main build; only a human decides
 * to spend one.

/**
 * **The declared owner of remote-host filesystem facts.**
 *
 * Two kinds of thing live here, and only here:
 *
 * 1. Everything about a deployed install that is DERIVED from the composition
 *    name (below) — because the alternative is a column per value, and a column
 *    is something a human can set wrong.
 * 2. Absolute paths and interpreter locations **on the deployed host**.
 *
 * (2) is a genuinely distinct category from the paths `@plugins/infra/plugins/paths`
 * owns, and conflating them is a real error rather than a stylistic one: that
 * plugin resolves paths on *this* machine, whereas every path here describes a
 * *different* machine — an Ubuntu box, reached over SSH, whose layout has nothing
 * to do with the developer's laptop. A dev-host constant used in a generated
 * remote script would be silently wrong (this machine is macOS; the target is
 * not), so `paths` deliberately does not and cannot supply them.
 *
 * That is why `paths:no-hardcoded-paths` allowlists THIS file specifically, on
 * exactly the same principle by which it allowlists `paths.ts` itself and
 * `database/plugins/embedded/shared/internal/paths.ts`: the owner of a path
 * family is source-of-truth territory, while every consumer stays policed. So a
 * new remote-host path belongs **here**, named, not inlined into the CLI's
 * generated scripts — where the check would (correctly) reject it.
 *
 * `runUser` is the reason this file exists rather than a wider `deploy_deployments`
 * row. Its only real requirement is *not root* (embedded Postgres refuses to
 * `initdb` as uid 0), and a configurable field with a default is a field someone
 * can set back to `root`. Deriving `svc-<composition>` makes "never root"
 * inexpressible rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * The composition name is the ONLY identity below the URL — the install dir, the
 * systemd instance, the runtime namespace, and the database all carry it (see
 * `research/2026-07-29-global-composition-production-deployment.md`, §One name,
 * end to end). Every name here is therefore a pure function of that one string,
 * and `converge` / `ship` must read them from here rather than re-spelling them:
 * a path spelled twice is a path that eventually disagrees with itself.
 *
 * The caller is expected to hand in a composition name that exists in the
 * `compositions` config — the create/update handler is what enforces that, and
 * membership there also means the name passed `assertCompositionName`'s
 * `[a-z0-9-]` shape, which is what makes it safe as a unix user, a path segment
 * and a systemd instance name. This module deliberately does not re-validate
 * (and so does not import build-time tooling into a `core/` the browser loads).

 * `bash <path>` over SSH, so this line is documentation rather than the thing
 * that selects the interpreter — it matters because a failed run deliberately
 * *leaves the script on the host* for a human to read, and a script found in
 * `/tmp` should say what runs it.

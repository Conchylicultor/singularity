/**
 * Every value `deploy_runs.status` can hold, and the shared outcome each means.
 *
 * The mapping happens to be one-to-one, which is exactly why it is written down
 * rather than passing the column straight through. The union validates each
 * row's outcome against the closed vocabulary, so a status added to `deploy_runs`
 * and not mapped here would leak an invalid outcome into the page — silently, if
 * it were a passthrough. As a `Record<DeployRunStatus, RunOutcome>` folded into
 * the `CASE`, the branch set IS the status set and an unmapped one is a `tsc`
 * error.
 *
 * `running` is a legitimate row to read back and sometimes a stale one: a
 * backend that died mid-run leaves it, because the process that would have
 * stamped an outcome is the one that went away. Reading `running` is the honest
 * record of that; nothing here invents a terminal status nobody observed.

/**
 * Where a deploy row goes when it is clicked.
 *
 * `deploymentDetailPane` nests under the server page, so opening it needs BOTH
 * ids, and both are spelled here: a pane's params are its route's CHAINED set,
 * so the ancestor's `serverId` is nameable even though this row is nowhere near
 * the server page. An open never discards a param the caller supplied — a
 * relative open materializes any declared ancestor the route does not already
 * hold and whose params the caller named — so `serverId` is what puts
 * `server/<id>` in the URL from all three of this row's hosts (the build
 * button's popover, and inside the build and backup panes). Trimming it to the
 * pane's own id strands the pane without its ancestor.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the barrel because a barrel may hold only
 * imports, re-exports, type aliases and the single default export.

/**
 * The Deployments section of a server's page: which compositions this server
 * serves, and the two verbs over each.
 *
 * A deployment is `(composition × server) → { hostnames, loopbackPort }`, so on
 * this pane the server half is fixed and only the composition and its URL vary.
 * The row carries only what a person scans down the list — the composition, the
 * last run, and (contributed) the release state; the record's editable fields and
 * the derived install names live in the row's own pane, one click away.
 *
 * The list reads this server's rows of the `deployments` collection (`where:
 * { serverId }`), and it is gated together with the run map
 * (`useCombinedResources`), so the list and the run chips can never render from
 * a half-loaded snapshot — a deployment showing "not run" only because the run
 * map had not arrived would be exactly the wrong-state-while-loading bug.
 *
 * Contributed as a `ServerDetail` section, so the card, its "Deployments" title
 * and its collapse state all belong to the host.
 *
 * There is deliberately no log panel here any more. The deployment pane's Output
 * section subscribes to the same `deploy` channel, and a second live
 * subscription to one channel — under a heading, on a page that no longer hosts
 * the actions — was duplication rather than a view. Nothing is lost: the channel
 * replays its ring buffer on subscribe, so the pane shows the last run's tail on
 * open, and `RunFailureNotice` still surfaces a failed run here with the CLI's
 * own words.

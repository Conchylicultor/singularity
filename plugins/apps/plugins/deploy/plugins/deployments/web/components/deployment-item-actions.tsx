 * Why a verb cannot be launched right now, as the sentence to put in the tooltip

 *
 * Two kinds of reason, and both are facts this app already holds: a run is
 * already in flight on the box, or the probe has not established a platform for
 * it (never checked / last check failed / reported something no release targets —
 * spelled out separately rather than folded into one null test).
 *
 * The probe ones deliberately MIRROR the CLI's own refusals rather than replacing
 * them: the platform a deploy needs is discovered by that probe, so a button that
 * would certainly be refused says so before it is pressed. Every other refusal
 * stays the CLI's, reported after the fact on the row.
 *
 * Exported because the deployment pane's Deploy button gates on the same facts.
 * Sharing the hook rather than the sentences is the point: a row tooltip and the
 * pane's primary action must never disagree about why something is blocked.

 *
 * ONE action rather than the `converge` and `ship` pair this replaces. Those two
 * were the constraint chain rendered as buttons — ship refuses on an unconverged
 * host, and refuses without a platform-matched bundle — and the chain is now the
 * phases of a single run, sequenced server-side. Neither could do anything
 * `update` does not: converge is its first leg and genuinely a no-op the second
 * time, and ship is its last, differing only by skipping the build (which
 * `compareToHead` already skips when nothing moved). The pane's Deploy button
 * gave up the same two buttons for the same reason; a row that kept them made
 * the same deployment answer to two different vocabularies.
 *
 * `converge`/`ship` alone remain CLI verbs — `./singularity deploy converge`
 * repairs host drift without restarting what is serving — but a bare icon on a
 * list row is the wrong place to offer a partial deploy, because the row has
 * nowhere to say which part it left out.

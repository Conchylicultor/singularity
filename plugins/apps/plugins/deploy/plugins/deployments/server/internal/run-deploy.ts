 * the window the 2026-08-28 incident died in: an unrelated `./singularity build`
 * hot-restarted the backend, the gateway signalled its process group, and
 * `drun-1787890652933-wr3v6d` lost its ship 0.9 s after spawning it.
 *
 * A `defineSupervisedJob` `steps` body: each leg is a `step` — spawned detached
 * inside a memoized step, then waited on with the shared observe-then-wait loop
 * — and every other gap is a `ctx.step` or a `ctx.waitFor`. So the handler
 * returns through the jobs plugin's suspend sentinel and comes back as a fresh
 * dispatch in whichever backend is alive by then. Nothing holds a worker slot
 * while a leg or a release runs.
 *
 * **The step names ARE the leg names** (`converge`, `ship`), so a step's child
 * id `<runId>.<step>` is `legRunId(runId, leg)` — the id the ledger records and
 * the transcript and marker are named by.
 *
 * `hold` is **`seconds`**, not `instant`: what bounds a dispatch is one `git`
 * read (`compareToHead`, behind the shared heavy-read pool) plus a handful of
 * indexed queries. `instant` would be a claim of no blocking I/O that a `git`
 * invocation makes false.
 *
 * The ledger's `claim` ADOPTS the row the endpoint claimed (`startDeployRun`),
 * answering `null` when it is already closed, so a job for a finished run
 * sequences nothing.

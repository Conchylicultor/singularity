/**
 * How one spawned `./singularity deploy` verb ended, and the single line that
 * says so — the `message` stamped on the run and rendered in the UI.
 *
 * Its own file because the choice of sentence is a pure decision worth testing,
 * and because it is where a whole class of wrong answer was possible: a status
 * of `128 + signo` is what POSIX reports for a KILLED child, so a run that was
 * signalled came back looking exactly like a run that chose to exit with that
 * status. It was then recorded, and shown, as `Exited with code 143` — a
 * sentence about a command that never exited and never refused. Observed:
 * `drun-1787890652933-wr3v6d`, whose `ship` was killed 0.9 s after it spawned
 * because a `./singularity build` hot-restarted the backend it was a child of.
 *
 * The verb now runs under the supervised-run primitive, which fixes both halves
 * of that incident: the child is detached, so a backend restart no longer kills
 * it, and `signalCode` is **observed** — the shim's signal trap fired — rather
 * than guessed from the status. Nothing here may re-derive killed-ness from
 * `exitCode > 128`; that is the original guess wearing a different hat.

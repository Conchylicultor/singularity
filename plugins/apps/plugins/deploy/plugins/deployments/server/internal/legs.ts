/**
 * A **leg**: one spawned `./singularity deploy` command inside one deploy run.
 *
 * A run and a leg are not the same thing, and this file exists because the
 * supervised-run primitive names legs while everything else here names runs. A
 * `converge` or a `ship` is one leg; an `update` is two legs with a release
 * build between them (that build spawns nothing of its own here — it is another
 * plugin's job, waited on durably — so it is a phase, never a leg).
 *
 * Each leg needs its own supervised-run id because each gets its own transcript
 * and its own exit marker, and the primitive refuses to reuse an id whose marker
 * already exists. So the leg id is `<runId>.<leg>`, which the run id itself can
 * never contain (`drun-<ms>-<rand>`) and which `assertRunId` accepts unchanged.
 *
 * **This file used to hold two in-memory maps as well** — `waiters`, keyed per
 * leg, and `driving`, keyed per run — and both are gone. They existed because a
 * supervised leg's outcome arrived at the kind's `finish` rather than at the
 * call that started it, and because an `update` spent minutes between its legs
 * awaiting a release in-process with nothing durable to resume from. The
 * sequence is a `defineSupervisedJob` `steps` body now: each leg is a step,
 * whose memo remembers the child it spawned and whose wait is durable, so "who
 * is sequencing this run" stopped being a question about which process is alive.

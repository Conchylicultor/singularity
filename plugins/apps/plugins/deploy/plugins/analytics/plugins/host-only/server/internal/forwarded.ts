 * The proxy chain in front of a deployed backend, and the ONE place that knows it.

 *   visitor ──▶ Caddy ──▶ gateway (127.0.0.1:<port>) ──▶ backend (unix socket)
 *
 * - Caddy's `reverse_proxy` treats every client as untrusted (no
 *   `trusted_proxies` in the generated site block), so it REPLACES any
 *   client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` with the one address it saw.
 * - The gateway is an `httputil.ReverseProxy` in Director mode
 *   (`gateway/worktree.go` `newReverseProxy`), which APPENDS its own peer —
 *   Caddy, on loopback — to the header.
 *
 * So a public request reaches the backend with exactly two hops
 * (`<visitor>, 127.0.0.1`), while a request made on the box straight to the
 * gateway's loopback port (an SSH `curl`, the activate script's health gate,
 * or local dev through `*.localhost:9000`) carries exactly one.

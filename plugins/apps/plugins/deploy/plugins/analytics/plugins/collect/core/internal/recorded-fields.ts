/**
 * What one visit records — the data behind the dashboard's "What one visit
 * records" panel, and the list the server's storage is checked against.
 *
 * Each field names the storage columns (drizzle keys of `analytics_visits` /
 * `analytics_hits`) that hold it. The server asserts at compile time that the
 * union of those columns is EXACTLY the set of stored columns minus row
 * identifiers — so a column added to the tables without a field here, or a
 * field here with no column behind it, is a type error, and the panel cannot
 * drift from what is actually stored.

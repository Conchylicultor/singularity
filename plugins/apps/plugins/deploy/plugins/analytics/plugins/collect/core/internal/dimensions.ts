 * Dimensions an analytics report breaks visits down by — a CLOSED list.

 * - a **visit dimension** has exactly one value per visit (its entry page, its
 *   channel, its browser…), read from one column of `analytics_visits`;
 * - a **hit dimension** can have several values per visit (every page it
 *   viewed, every event it fired), read from `analytics_hits`.
 *
 * Every dimension is also a filter: a filter `(dimension, value)` keeps the
 * visits that HAVE that value — for a hit dimension, visits with at least one
 * such hit.

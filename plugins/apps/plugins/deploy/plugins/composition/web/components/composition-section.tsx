 * **Composition** — *what* this deployment builds and ships, and where that is

 *
 * Every other section of this pane answers a question about the *placement*: at
 * which URL, on which box, from which bundle, on which run. The software itself
 * was named only by the pane's tab title and implied by the derived install
 * paths, so the one thing a deploy is *of* was the one thing the surface never
 * said out loud.
 *
 * It stays a **reference**, not an editor: `compositionId` is create-only on the
 * row precisely because re-pointing a converged install at different software is
 * not an edit, and the composition's own membership lives in the `compositions`
 * config, which Studio owns. So this section names the composition, states
 * enough of its shape to recognise it, and hands off.

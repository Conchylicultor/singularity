/**
 * One reachability verdict per server — the row of the
 * `deploy_servers_ext_health` side-table (built from this shape in
 * `server/internal/tables.ts`), minus `hostKeyLine`: the pinned known_hosts
 * line is `serverOnly`, so it stays server-side — no client surface needs it.
 * The row keys on `serverId` (the `parent_id` PK).
 *
 * `checkedPublicKey` is `deploy_servers.ssh_public_key` **as of the check**, and
 * it is what makes "verified" exact without any cross-plugin write: the setup
 * step is done iff `ok && checkedPublicKey === server.sshKey?.publicKey`.
 * Replace the key and that line changes, the comparison fails, and the verify
 * step drops back to `active` on its own — `health` never has to be told, and
 * `servers` never has to import `health` to invalidate it.
 *
 * The column is the same string `servers` projects into `sshKey.publicKey`, so
 * the two sides are comparable by construction. A pasted key is no longer an
 * exception: `servers` derives its public half at the door, so it too carries a
 * real line here rather than a `null` that compares equal to everything.
 *
 * `platform` is the probe's second byproduct, and unlike `hostKeyLine` it DOES
 * reach the wire: a deployment surface has to show which artifact a server will
 * accept. `(ok, platform)` spells out four distinct states, which is what keeps
 * the null from absorbing a failure:
 *
 * | state | meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | no row at all | never probed — we have never reached this box |
 * | `ok: false` | the last probe failed; there was no output to read a platform from |
 * | `ok: true`, `platform: null` | reached it, and it did not report a platform we support |
 * | `ok: true`, `platform: tag` | reached it, and it will accept `tag` artifacts |
 *
 * `converge` / `ship` therefore refuse on a null with a message naming which of
 * the three non-shippable states it is, instead of asserting against the null.

/**
 * Drives the deployment pane's remote-deploy section against the deployed app.
 *
 * Manual only (nothing runs this automatically):
 *
 *   ./singularity run plugins/apps/plugins/deploy/plugins/remote-deploy/e2e/remote-deploy-verify.ts [--headed]
 *
 * It reads the first deployment out of the running app rather than seeding one:
 * a deployment names a real remote host, so creating one here would leave a
 * record pointing at a box this script never touches.
 *
 * It never presses **Deploy**. That button converges a real host and ships to
 * it; only a human, on a deployment they own, gets to start that.

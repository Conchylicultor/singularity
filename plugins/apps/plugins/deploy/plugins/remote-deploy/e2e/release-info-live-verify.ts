/**
 * A deployment's release info is LIVE (I7c of
 * research/2026-10-01-global-scoped-change-routing-p5-p8-v2.md): the newest run
 * is the routed `release.history` window (limit 1) and the bundle verdict the
 * external `release.candidate` value — no revision tick, no refetch. And the
 * two are gated so a just-finished build never flashes a stale answer.
 *
 *  1. seeds a server whose last probe reached it and reported `linux-x64`, and a
 *     deployment of a fresh composition on it (no bundle on disk);
 *  2. opens the server's deployments list and the deployment's pane: the
 *     Release chip reads "Not built" and the pane says nothing is built;
 *  3. a candidate run of that composition starts (a row INSERT): the chip
 *     reads "Building", live;
 *  4. its bundle lands on disk (run dir, `RELEASE.json`, the packed binary, the
 *     `latest-linux-x64` pointer) and its row flips to succeeded by hand —
 *     which, unlike the engine's own close, nudges no candidate observation.
 *     The chip must NOT fall back to "Not built": the candidate provably
 *     predates the run, so the info holds `loading` (or, if something else
 *     took a fresh observation meanwhile, already reads "Built");
 *  5. a reload takes a fresh observation: "Built", and the pane names the
 *     platform;
 *  6. a newer run starts — "Building", live — and fails: with a good bundle
 *     still on disk the chip goes back to "Built", live (a failure is not the
 *     state while Ship would still pick the older bundle).
 *
 * Seeds and cleans its own rows and bundle dir (also on failure). A seeded
 * running row carries THIS script's pid, so the supervised-run reconciler (which
 * closes a running row whose pid is dead) sees it alive and leaves it to the
 * script. The seeded server is never probed, so nothing reaches a real host. Refuses main (it
 * seeds rows into the deploy's database).
 *
 * Manual only — nothing runs this automatically.

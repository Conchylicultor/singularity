/**
 * The SSH section's header-right controls — the one region visible both
 * collapsed and expanded, i.e. the section's real status line.
 *
 * It carries the two things a collapsed card must still answer:
 *
 * - **Which provider this server is on**, as a chip. The provider is a property
 *   of the *server*, not of the section, so it cannot live in the section's
 *   static `label`; a chip beside the title says the same thing without the
 *   title changing identity per row.
 * - **Which key we hold**, as its SHA256 fingerprint (or `No key`). Rendered
 *   exactly ONCE in the whole section: no step reprints it. Two places showing
 *   key state is the bug this section exists to have fixed. The *verdict* —
 *   whether that key works — is a different fact with a different owner, and
 *   lives in the last step (`health`'s `VerifyConnectionBody`).

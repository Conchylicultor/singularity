/**
 * The SSH-setup section of a server page — the BODY only. The card, its title,
 * its chevron and its open state belong to the `ServerDetail` host, so this
 * section cannot drift from its peers on any of them; what the contribution
 * declares beside this component is the header (`label`, `icon`, `actions`) and
 * the seed for the open state (`useDefaultOpen: () => !verified` — expanded
 * while action is needed, collapsed to one row once the connection is proven).
 *
 * It **always renders**: key setup is the collection's job, and a matched
 * provider is decoration (a chip in the header, console prose in a step) on top
 * of it. It used to bail out when the console URL was empty, unparsable, or
 * matched no provider — which left exactly those servers with no way to set a
 * key at all.
 *
 * Two facts, two owners, both rendered exactly once: the **fingerprint** (what
 * key we hold) lives in the header `actions` (`SshSetupActions`), and the
 * **verdict** (whether that key works) lives in the last step, owned by
 * `health`. The header is the one region visible both collapsed and expanded, so
 * it is the real status line; a step that reprinted the fingerprint would
 * recreate the two-places-disagree bug at a new pair of locations.

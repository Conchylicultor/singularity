/**
 * Recovers the public half of keys pasted before validation existed, so a row
 * that holds a usable private key can name it.
 *
 * Eager rather than lazy on purpose: the derived value has to be there the
 * FIRST time the page renders, or precisely the users with the problem (a
 * pasted key and a NULL column) see "No key" until they touch something —
 * reintroducing the confusion this change exists to remove. The `IS NULL` guard
 * makes every later boot a zero-row no-op, so a job + warm-up would be more
 * machinery than the work it schedules.
 *
 * A key we still cannot use (passphrase-protected, or not a key at all) keeps
 * its NULL column and the UI keeps saying "No key" — which is honest, and lets
 * the user generate over it since `assertReplaceAllowed` keys on the column.

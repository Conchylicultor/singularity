/**
 * Verifies the investigate action appears on exactly the failed runs in a
 * deployment's History, and that pressing it opens the launch form.
 *
 * The interesting assertion is the NEGATIVE one: the gate is
 * `status === "failed"`, not "not succeeded", so a permanently-`running` row —
 * one whose backend died mid-run — must stay clean too. Counting buttons
 * globally would pass with the gate written either way, so this walks each
 * button back to its own row and reads that row's outcome badge instead.
 *
 * Hover-reveal is opacity + pointer-events, not mount/unmount, so the buttons
 * are in the DOM without simulating hover; the click at the end goes through
 * Playwright's own hover, which is what makes them pressable.

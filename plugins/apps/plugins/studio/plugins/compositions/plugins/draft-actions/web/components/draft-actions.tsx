/**
 * Persistence actions for the active draft: an inline editable name plus Save /
 * Delete / Clear. The pane's `:id` is the composition being edited, so Save is
 * always an in-place update.
 *
 * Delete is available for every composition except the two the repo itself owns
 * as committed source — main's row and `base-exclusions`. Those entries must
 * exist, so the button is simply absent there (the config edit underneath
 * throws on them). It removes the row AND what the composition is serving: the
 * same `useDeleteComposition` the list row's Delete calls, so the two paths
 * cannot drift. The button pends while the server says what is at stake, then a
 * confirm dialog names every address and database that will go; only once they
 * are actually reclaimed does the draft clear and the pane close.
 *
 * Save is inert for those same two rows. What they contain decides what the app
 * ships, and codegen emits the registries from the COMMITTED config — so a
 * stored edit here would sit in the user layer looking like a change and never
 * reach a generated file. Changing them is an edit to
 * `plugins/plugin-meta/plugins/composition/core/config.ts` plus a build; the
 * `save` call underneath throws if this button is ever reached.

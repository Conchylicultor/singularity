/**
 * no-raw-history-nav
 *
 * Navigation must go through the sanctioned `navigate(url)` from
 * `@plugins/apps/web`, never a raw `window.history.pushState(...)` /
 * `history.replaceState(...)`.
 *
 * With the tab model, each tab carries both an `appId` and a URL. A raw history
 * write changes the focused tab's URL while leaving its `appId` stale —
 * `useActiveApp()` (URL-driven) then resolves to a DIFFERENT app than the
 * focused tab actually is, desyncing the tab bar and the focused store's base
 * path. `navigate(url)` resolves the target app, opens-or-focuses its tab, and
 * sets the route through the live `PaneStore`, keeping `appId` and URL in sync.
 *
 * Detection is leaf-name based (like `no-raw-web-fetch`): any CallExpression
 * whose callee is a MemberExpression ending in `.pushState` / `.replaceState` —
 * one check covers BOTH `window.history.X(...)` and bare `history.X(...)`
 * (the leaf property is identical; only the object chain differs). `.back()` /
 * `.forward()` and `history.state` reads are not matched. The two sanctioned
 * low-level URL writers (the pane store's `setRoute` and apps-layout's pre-tab
 * canonicalization) are exempted via the contributing plugin's `ignores` globs
 * (see lint/index.ts).

After making code changes, always run `./singularity build` to deploy. Don't skip this step.

**Why:** The deploy step (build frontend + server + register gateway) is required for the app to be available at `<name>.localhost:9000`. User was annoyed it was skipped.

**How to apply:** After finishing code changes in a worktree, always run `./singularity build` before telling the user the work is done.

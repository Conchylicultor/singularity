When the user says "push", always run `./singularity push` — never do manual git add/commit/push.

**Why:** The CLI handles the full workflow (commit, ff-only merge to main, push). Manual git commands bypass this.

**How to apply:** Any time the user says "push" or "now push", run `./singularity push` from the worktree.

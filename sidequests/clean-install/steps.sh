#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Steps run inside the throwaway guest VM, in order, following docs/setup.md
# as literally as a brand-new user would read it.
#
# Each step is a bash function that ECHOES the shell command(s) it wants run
# in the guest — it is a command GENERATOR, not the command itself, so
# run.sh can log the exact text it sent before it ran anything.
#
# Every step also sets two sibling variables:
#   <fn>_DOC  — one line saying what docs/setup.md (or CLAUDE.md) says at
#               this point, so the summary reads as a diff against the docs.
#   <fn>_TAG  — one of:
#     from-docs             the command a new user reading the doc would run
#     documented-elsewhere   the fix exists in writing, just not in the doc
#                            that was supposed to cover this
#     undocumented-knowledge no doc says this; a new user has to guess or
#                            search the web to find it
#
# A step may also set <fn>_EXPECT_FAIL=1. That marks a blocker an earlier run
# already recorded, whose fix is the step right after it: the run records the
# failure and carries on instead of stopping. Only set it for a failure whose
# exact error is already written down in the run's findings.
#
# New steps get appended here as a baseline run discovers what else is
# missing, each with its own DOC/TAG. Do not edit an existing step to route
# around a failure — the failure it produces today IS the finding; add the
# fix as the NEXT step instead, so the run stays a legible diff against
# docs/setup.md.

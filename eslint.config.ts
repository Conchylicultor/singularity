/**
 * Repo ESLint config — for the editor/IDE integration and ad-hoc `bunx eslint`.
 *
 * The rules, plugin contributions, and per-rule exemptions all live in the
 * shared builder `plugins/framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/lint/core/build-lint-config.ts`,
 * so this config and the `type-check` check (which builds the same config but
 * reuses a pre-built TypeScript program) can never drift. This file only picks
 * the parser's type source: `projectService: true`, which discovers each file's
 * tsconfig. A file that resolves to no project errors loudly.
 *
 * ESLint loads this file through its own jiti, which knows nothing of the
 * tsconfig `@plugins/*` alias. So the builder is loaded through a SECOND jiti
 * created here with that alias: everything the builder reaches — lint core, the
 * exempt primitive, every lint barrel and rule — then resolves `@plugins/*`
 * exactly as Bun does for the type-check worker, and no file below has to stay
 * alias-free for this one loader's sake.
 *
 * `exemptions: "config-off"`: an exempted file gets the rule switched off in
 * the config, so the editor shows no squiggle there. The type-check worker uses
 * the `"report"` mode instead, which also catches an exemption that suppresses
 * nothing. Both modes read the same manifests through one loader.

// ─── the environment every child process starts from ─────────
//
// The gateway used to hand each child its OWN environment plus a few additions
// (`append(os.Environ(), "SOCKET_PATH=…")`), and the exec sites that set no Env
// at all got the same thing implicitly: a nil Cmd.Env in Go means "inherit
// everything". The gateway's own environment is whatever its starter carried.
// Started from an agent shell, that was the shell's SINGULARITY_CONVERSATION_ID,
// TMUX and CLAUDE_* — so every backend on the host (main, central, each
// worktree) ran as that one conversation, and so did everything they spawned:
// op-log records and commit trailers named it, and tmux clients followed its
// TMUX socket instead of the default one.
//
// So the environment a child gets is now DECLARED. The launcher passes the
// declared names as `-child-env` (from runtimeEnvNames() in
// plugins/infra/plugins/launcher/core); the gateway captures the matching part
// of its own environment once, at boot, and every child starts from exactly
// that plus its own named additions. Go holds no list of names of its own: a
// Go-side default would be a second copy of the declaration, free to drift.
//
// This file is the ONLY non-test file that may call os.Environ() or
// exec.Command (enforced by the launcher:gateway-env-explicit check), so no
// exec site can fall back to the implicit inherit by forgetting to set Env.

// ChildEnv is the base environment every gateway child starts from: the
// declared subset of the gateway's own environment, captured once at boot.
//
// The zero value is an EMPTY environment, never "inherit" — With and Command
// always return a non-nil Env, so a ChildEnv that was never threaded through
// fails visibly (a child with no PATH or HOME) instead of silently leaking.

// by the launcher, so a bad entry means the declaration and this parser
// disagree, and forwarding "whatever parsed" would hide it. A lone `*` is
// rejected because it would match every name — the inherit-everything this

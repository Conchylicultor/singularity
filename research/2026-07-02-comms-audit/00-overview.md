## 1. The one-paragraph summary

Singularity has **one sanctioned way to do each kind of communication**, and
checks/lints that ban hand-rolled alternatives. Reads that must stay fresh go
through **live-state resources** (server-computed values pushed over a shared,
leader-elected WebSocket). One-shot reads and writes go through **typed
endpoints** (zod-validated HTTP contracts). Server-to-server change detection
goes through **Postgres itself** (statement triggers → `pg_notify` → LISTEN),
so no write can ever be missed — even writes made by `psql` from outside the
process. Recurring/background work goes through **durable jobs**
(graphile-worker) bound to **typed events**, never `setInterval`. Everything
rides through a **Go gateway** on port 9000 that routes by subdomain to
per-worktree Bun backends over Unix domain sockets.

## 2. Process topology (who talks to whom)

```

Key facts:

- **Backends have no TCP port.** The gateway hands each one a Unix socket
  (`~/.singularity/sockets/<name>.sock`) and dials it directly, for both HTTP
  and hand-rolled WebSocket byte-shuttling. Zero port allocation problems.
- **One Postgres cluster, many databases.** Every worktree gets a full fork of
  the main `singularity` DB (data + migration state), named after its attempt
  id. Isolation is per-database, not per-cluster.
- **Two connection paths to Postgres.** App queries go through PgBouncer
  (transaction pooling, port 6432). Anything session-bound — `LISTEN`,
  graphile-worker, logical replication, `pg_dump` — goes direct to 5433.
- **The central backend is a second, singleton Bun process** hosting state
  that must be shared across all worktrees (OAuth tokens, secrets). Browsers
  reach it via path-prefix routes (`~/.singularity/central-routes.json`) that
  work on *any* host — required for OAuth callbacks on bare `localhost`.

## 3. The three communication idioms (client ↔ server)

Every client↔server interaction in the codebase is one of exactly three
shapes. Picking the right one is the main design decision; the wrong one is
usually caught by a check.

### Idiom A — Typed request/response (`endpoints`)

For **actions** (mutations) and **one-shot reads** that don't need to stay
fresh. A contract declared once in `core/endpoints.ts` with `defineEndpoint`,
implemented server-side with `implement()`, consumed with
`useEndpoint`/`useEndpointMutation`/`fetchEndpoint`. Zod validation at both
ends, `HttpError`/`EndpointError` as the error model. Raw `fetch("/api/…")`
from web code is banned by lint.

### Idiom B — Level-state sync (`live-state` resources)

For **anything the UI wants kept in sync with server truth**. A resource is a
named, schema'd server-side loader (`defineResource`); the client subscribes
with `useResource` and receives *level state* (full values or keyed row
deltas — never event streams the client must fold). The server decides when
to recompute (triggered by the DB change-feed, not by mutation code), diffs,
and pushes over the shared `/ws/notifications` socket. Hand-rolled SSE or WS
for state sync is banned by check.

### Idiom C — Append-only firehoses (dedicated WS / NDJSON)

For streams that are genuinely append-only and unbounded: terminal PTY bytes
(`/ws/terminal`), live log tailing (`/ws/logs`), progressive results of a
heavy fan-out (NDJSON streaming responses). These are the sanctioned
exceptions to "everything is a resource" — level-state semantics don't fit a
byte stream.

**Rule of thumb the codebase follows:** if a component would need `useEffect`
+ refetch to stay correct, it should be a resource (Idiom B). If it's a
button click or a form submit, it's an endpoint (Idiom A). If it scrolls
forever, it's a firehose (Idiom C).

## 4. The server-side data flow (DB → client), end to end

The load-bearing pipeline — what happens when *any* row changes in Postgres:

```
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on any public table (from anywhere: handler, job, psql)
      │
      ▼  [L4 — change-feed]  STATEMENT trigger on every table
  live_state_notify()  ──┬──▶  pg_notify('live_state', {t, op, ids})     (live path)
                         └──▶  INSERT live_state_changelog (xid, t, op, ids)  (durable outbox,
      │                                                     same transaction — atomic)
      ▼
  change-feed LISTEN consumer (dedicated non-pooled connection)
      │  routeChange(): base table + every dependent view
      ▼
  applyDbChange()  — inverts the table→resources index
      │     • index fed by [L3 — read-set capture]: every SQL query a loader
      │       runs is recorded against that loader automatically
      │     • scope decision: UPDATE with ids + covered path → scoped;
      │       INSERT/DELETE/unknown → FULL recompute for that resource
      ▼
  scheduleNotify → flush cycle over the dependsOn DAG (level-parallel,
      │            affectedMap translates row ids across edges,
      │            signature gates suppress irrelevant cascades)
      ▼
  loader recompute (possibly scoped to affected ids)
      │     • keyed resources: diff vs per-subscriber snapshot → upserts/deletes  [L1]
      │     • boot-critical resources: value + xmin watermark + read-set
      │       persisted to live_state_snapshot  [L2]
      ▼
  WS frame to every subscribed tab:  update | delta | invalidate
      │
      ▼
  leader tab NotificationsClient → TanStack Query cache → React re-render
  (followers receive the same frame via BroadcastChannel relay)
```

The four numbered layers (terminology used literally in code and research
docs):

- **L1 — keyed delta sync**: array resources with a `keyOf` ship row-level
  upserts/deletes instead of the whole array; unchanged rows keep object
  identity so memoized rows skip re-render.
- **L2 — persisted materialization**: boot-critical resource values are
  persisted (with an xmin watermark and their read-set) so a cold server boot
  serves them instantly and replays only the changelog rows it missed.
- **L3 — read-set capture**: the DB pool chokepoint records which tables each
  loader actually reads. No manual dependency declarations for the common
  case; the debug pane diffs this truth against the hand-drawn graph.
- **L4 — DB change-feed**: the Postgres triggers + LISTEN/NOTIFY above. Its
  design goal: *missed invalidations are structurally impossible*, because
  invalidation is driven by the database itself, not by remembering to call
  `notify()` in every mutation path.

Because of L4, a DB-backed resource **has no `.notify()` method at all** —
only `defineExternalResource` (for non-DB sources like files or git) gets
one. Forgetting to invalidate is a compile-time impossibility, not a bug
class.

## 6. The design principles that explain everything else

1. **Level state, not event streams.** Clients receive *values* (or value
   deltas), never domain events they must fold into state. This kills the
   whole "missed event while reconnecting" bug class: reconnect = resubscribe
   = fresh value.
2. **The database is the change bus.** Mutation code never signals
   invalidation; the write itself does, via triggers. Out-of-process writes
   (another worktree, `psql`, a job) are invalidation-equivalent to in-process
   ones.
3. **One socket per origin, one computation per change.** Leader election
   means N tabs cost one WebSocket and one server-side recompute; followers
   get frames relayed over BroadcastChannel.
4. **Contracts are single-sourced.** Endpoint route strings double as route
   keys; resource descriptors carry key + schema + keyed-ness so server and
   client structurally cannot drift; entity tables and wire schemas derive
   from one field record.
5. **Durability at every async boundary.** Jobs are graphile rows (survive
   restarts), the change-feed has a durable outbox (survives downtime),
   emitted events are durable dispatch jobs, boot catch-up replays the
   changelog. In-process timers and fire-and-forget are the exception and
   must be justified.
6. **Escape hatches are visible.** FULL recomputes, feed exemptions,
   unbounded waits, polling fallbacks all require an explicit, greppable
   opt-out with a reason — and debug surfaces (read-set pane, `_debug`
   endpoint, queue-health, churn monitors) measure how often the escape
   hatches fire.

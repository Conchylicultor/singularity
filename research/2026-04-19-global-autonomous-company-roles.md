## Context

Singularity today is a coding-agent manager: humans create tasks, agents execute them. The vision extends further — Singularity as the hub for a **self-running company** where agents handle not only engineering but marketing, support, ops, finance, and strategy, with humans supervising by exception.

This doc catalogs the full surface area: every function a real software company performs, reframed as agent roles. It does not specify how each role is implemented — that depends on the plugin primitive (part 2) and infra layer (part 3). It does specify *what* agents should be able to do, organized so the roadmap (part 4) can sequence them by blast radius.

## Organizing principle

A company's work splits along two axes:

- **Inward vs. outward**. Inward functions (analytics, docs, cost monitoring) have low blast radius — mistakes hurt internally. Outward functions (support replies, marketing posts, billing) reach customers; mistakes are public.
- **Tactical vs. strategic**. Tactical functions execute known workflows. Strategic functions generate goals from ambiguous signal.

Agents should land inward-tactical first (safe to automate), then outward-tactical (with human approval gates), then strategic (the hardest). This is the structure used in the roadmap.

## Functions

Each function below is one or more specialized agent roles. Each gets:
- **Purpose** — what the role exists to do
- **Typical inputs** — signals that wake it
- **Typical outputs** — artifacts or actions it produces
- **Default trust envelope** — `auto` / `review` / `approve` as a starting point (tunable per command; see part 2)

**Roadmap curation**
- Purpose: convert signals (support, research, metrics, strategy) into prioritized specs
- Inputs: the above + current objectives
- Outputs: spec drafts, priority ranking, dependency graphs
- Trust: `review` — the roadmap is load-bearing for strategic autonomy

### Finance & legal

**Billing**
- Purpose: plan definitions, invoices, Stripe ops, dunning, refunds, plan changes

- Outputs: invoice actions, dunning sequences, plan mutations, refund processing
- Trust: dunning `auto`, refunds under threshold `auto`, over threshold `approve`

**Accounting**
- Purpose: bookkeeping, expense classification, reconciliation, tax-prep handoff
- Inputs: bank feeds, Stripe payouts, expense receipts
- Outputs: categorized transactions, monthly close, tax-ready exports
- Trust: classification `auto`, close `review`

**Legal & compliance**
- Purpose: ToS/privacy drafts, DPAs, GDPR/SOC2 checklists, contract redlines
- Inputs: regulatory changes, enterprise contract requests, product changes with legal impact
- Outputs: doc drafts, redlines, checklists
- Trust: `approve` — legal exposure is high

### Ops & infra

**SRE / incident response**

## What stays human (near-term)

Even at "minimal supervision," some things stay human by design:

- **Capital allocation** — signing off on meaningful spend increases, fundraising, M&A
- **Hiring humans** — if the company employs people, humans decide
- **Final call on existential decisions** — pivots, shutdowns, acquisitions
- **Legal signatures** — contracts with real liability
- **Crisis response** — when something is on fire publicly, a human speaks

Everything else should trend toward `auto` as the trust system validates quality over time.

---

## Key tensions to resolve in design

1. **Blast radius vs. velocity.** Tighter trust envelopes are safer but slower. The system must make promotion from `approve` → `auto` easy once an agent earns it.
2. **Specialization vs. generalism.** One agent per function is legible but silo'd; a generalist agent has more context but diffuse quality. Likely answer: specialized agents with shared memory (part 3).
3. **Consistency vs. responsiveness.** Outward voice must be consistent (brand); agents must respond fast to incoming events. Shared institutional memory + style guides address this.
4. **Autonomy vs. auditability.** Full autonomy needs perfect audit trails or you can't debug failures. This is cheap if built into the primitive from day one (part 2).

## How this doc is used

The roadmap (part 4) sequences these roles by phase. The plugin primitive (part 2) defines how each role's tools and UI get expressed. The infra layer (part 3) gives them the shared substrate — memory, trust, cost, audit — to operate safely.

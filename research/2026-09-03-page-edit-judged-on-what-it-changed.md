# An agent's page edit is judged on what it changed

## Context

`edit_page` refuses edits nobody made. On 2026-09-02, `conv-1788356732-p7jw` spent
five attempts and ~4 minutes trying to append one `<agent-note>` card to a page,
was refused every time, gave up, and reported its findings in chat. The note was
never written.

Every refusal named a block the agent had not touched:

> block `block-8b56d608…` was rewritten or moved outside every "agent-note" card
> … (8 other writes in this edit landed outside a card too.)

`edit_page` re-applies the WHOLE scope document on every call, so every block on
the page round-trips through markdown → forest. Two things in that projection are
lossy, and each loss arrives at the boundary check as a write to the page's own
prose:

1. **An empty paragraph is a bare blank line**, and a blank line carries no
   indentation. It comes back at the depth of whatever follows, so one sitting at
   a different depth MOVES (a judged `parentId` write), and one at the start or
   end of a document or tag body is DROPPED. Designed behaviour, recorded in
   `research/2026-09-01-page-blank-line-empty-paragraph.md` as an accepted loss —
   what that doc did not anticipate is that it makes a whole page unwritable by
   any agent, for any edit.
2. **A paragraph whose text is only whitespace** (`" "`) is a blank line to the
   tokenizer, so it re-parses as empty — a text edit on prose. No dialect change
   can spell it: the tag means *empty*.

The agent could not have won. It diagnosed cause 1 correctly on its second attempt
and pinned the block the message named — but the refusal names ONE block and
counts the rest, and there were eight more it could not see.

**Measured, by replaying that exact edit through the real engine** (real handles,
main's 498 rows, the transcript's own `old_string`/`new_string`):

| | violations |
|---|---|
| today | 12 |
| noise subtraction alone | 7 |
| pin alone | 1 |
| **pin + subtraction** | **0** — 72 creates, nothing else touched |

Both halves are needed, and they fix different things. The pin stops the edit
RELOCATING untouched blocks (subtraction cannot cancel those: inserting a card
changes where neighbouring blank lines land, so the writes are not identical to
the identity round trip's). The subtraction absorbs what no projection can
represent — the whitespace-only paragraph.

Neither touches user content. The space stays a space; the blank line stays where
the author put it.

## Design

### 1. Pin an empty paragraph the dialect cannot place

In `serializeForestToMarkdown`'s inner `renderList`
(`plugins/page/plugins/editor/core/markdown.ts:1240`), in the flat-lines branch:
when the serialized line is whitespace-only and the node's position cannot be
stated by a blank line, emit the handle's tag form instead of the blank line.

```
line.trim() === ""  &&  (n.children.length > 0 || first || last of its sibling list)
```

The three positions mirror the parser's own rules: a blank line lands at the
following block's depth (so a node with children, or the last of its siblings,
lands wrong), and a leading or trailing blank run is dropped (so first and last
also vanish at a document or tag-body edge).

Two things this must NOT do:

- **It replaces only the LINE.** Do not route through the tag branch: a
  `body: "none"` tag self-closes and CONSUMES `n.children`. The walk keeps
  emitting children below the pinned line, exactly as for any other flat line.
  (No existing test covers an empty node WITH children — the fuzzer never
  generates one. Add that case, both directions.)
- **It never invents a spelling.** A handle whose `tagFor()` resolves to `null`
  keeps the blank line and keeps the loss.

`page/text`'s tag must emit no attributes, or the pin writes
`<text data="{&quot;text&quot;:[]}"/>`: add `attrs: () => ({})` to its tag
declaration (`plugins/page/plugins/text/core/text-block.ts:31`). The derived
projection JSON-encodes every non-string field into `data=` — see
`markdown.ts:379-401`. `parseAttrs` already ignores whatever it is handed, so a
bare `<text/>` still parses.

**The pin is agent-facing only.** `MarkdownContext` gains a second required
dialect field beside `blankLines`, in its shape and for its reason — a call site
that does not state its dialect is a tsc error:

```ts
/** How an empty block is EMITTED when a blank line cannot state its position. */
emptyBlocks: "pinned" | "blank-line";
```

| call site | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `markdown-apply/server/internal/markdown-context.ts` (`read_page`, `edit_page`) | `"pinned"` | the round trip must be exact |
| `markdown-apply/core/plan.ts` (the planner's own re-serialization) | `"pinned"` | must match the document the read produced, or alignment diffs two dialects |
| `editor/web/internal/clipboard-write.ts` | `"blank-line"` | a human pasting into another app never sees a tag; internal paste uses the structural clipboard flavour, so nothing is lost where it matters |
| the three web paste sites | `"blank-line"` | parse-side; states the field because the record is one dialect |

### 2. Subtract the round-trip noise

`ApplyBlockOptions` (`markdown-apply/server/internal/apply.ts:92`) gains:

```ts
/** The document the caller's edit was made against — what the read returned
 *  before the caller spliced it. Writes this document would ALSO produce are
 *  round-trip loss, not the caller's edit, and are dropped before judgement. */
baseline?: string;
```

`applyMarkdownToBlock` plans the baseline against the SAME rows, then subtracts
from the real plan every write that appears identically in both, and judges and
applies the remainder. The subtraction itself is a pure function in
`markdown-apply/core` (new `subtract-noise.ts`, exported from the core barrel) so
it is unit-testable without a database.

What can be compared, and what cannot:

- `updates`, `deleteIds`, `textEdits` — safe. They key off EXISTING row ids, and
  `planMarkdownApply` is otherwise deterministic (`Rank.nBetween` is
  deterministic; no randomness in `plan.ts` or `align.ts`).
- `creates` — **deliberately not subtracted.** Each pass mints fresh
  `crypto.randomUUID()` ids and a fresh `new Date()` (`plan.ts:336`, `plan.ts:569`),
  so two passes are not comparable. A create in the noise plan would mean the read
  invented a block; with the pin, none is observed. If one ever appears it lands
  outside a card and is refused loudly — which is the right failure.

The hook order stays as it is: subtract, then `assertAcceptable(plan, rows)`, then
write. The policy must judge what will actually be written.

`ApplyReport` is recomputed off the subtracted plan — `stats`, `createdIds`,
`survivingIds`, `textEditedIds` are all surfaced verbatim to the agent by
`applySummary` — plus one new count of writes the round trip absorbed, so the
subtraction is visible rather than silent.

Only `edit_page` passes `baseline` (`mcp-tools.ts:358` reads it,
`mcp-tools.ts:409` applies). `write_agent_note` builds its document from scratch
and holds no baseline; it needs none, since its apply is rooted at one card.

### 3. The invariant, as a test

**Reading a page out and applying it straight back must plan zero writes.**
Nothing asserts this today, which is why the loss was found by an agent burning
five attempts rather than by a failing test.

- Strengthen the existing property test (`markdown.test.ts:1568`): `representable()`
  currently filters out every empty node that is first or last of its siblings —
  precisely the cases the pin fixes. Drop that filter and let the property assert
  the exact round trip. Add empty-nodes-with-children to the fuzzer's generator.
- Flip `touched.test.ts:283` (`describe("an empty paragraph the blank-line dialect
  cannot place")`): the read now emits `<text/>`, the identity apply plans nothing,
  and `violationsOf(...)` becomes `toEqual([])`. Keep it as the regression pin,
  renamed to what it now proves.
- New unit tests for `subtractNoise`: identical write dropped, differing write on
  the same block kept, creates never dropped.

## Files

**Pin** — `editor/core/markdown.ts` (the branch + the `MarkdownContext` field),
`text/core/text-block.ts` (`attrs`), the five context call sites in the table
above, and the four test files carrying local mirror declarations of the `text`
handle (`markdown.test.ts`, `plan.test.ts`, `page-title.test.ts`,
`touched.test.ts`) which need the same `attrs: () => ({})` to match real output.

**Subtraction** — `markdown-apply/core/subtract-noise.ts` (new) + core barrel,
`markdown-apply/server/internal/apply.ts`, `agent-access/server/internal/mcp-tools.ts`.

**Docs** — `editor/CLAUDE.md`'s "Two empty blocks do NOT round-trip, knowingly"
paragraph (now false); the `read_page` tool description
(`mcp-tools.ts:126-136`), which currently tells agents to hand-place `<text/>`
themselves; and an addendum to `research/2026-09-01-page-blank-line-empty-paragraph.md`
recording that its accepted loss is closed and why.

## Verification

1. `./singularity build`, then `./singularity test plugins/page`.
2. The real repro, end to end: `read_page` on
   `block-f0d24b10-d743-409d-bbc1-844ed27db026` (the page that refused every edit),
   then `edit_page` appending a tagless `<agent-note>` card at page level. It must
   apply, reporting creates only — 0 updated, 0 deleted, 0 text-edited.
3. Confirm the read now shows `<text/>` at the four positions a blank line cannot
   state, and bare blank lines everywhere else.
4. Confirm a copy out of the editor still pastes with blank lines, no tags.

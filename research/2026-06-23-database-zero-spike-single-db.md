## Context

We hand-rolled a sync engine (`live-state` change-feed + IVM + delta-sync + optimistic
mutations) and keep fighting subtle correctness bugs in it. The roadmap proposes replacing it
with Rocicorp Zero. Before committing to that multi-stage migration, we need to answer one
question: **can `zero-cache` (zero-cache + Postgres logical replication) run at all inside our
embedded-Postgres / gateway world?**

This spike proves the mechanics on a throwaway, single-DB setup: enable `wal_level=logical` on
the embedded cluster, run **one** `zero-cache` against the **main `singularity` DB only**, sync a
tiny slice of the `tasks` table, and render it in a **new disposable debug pane** through ZQL —
with **no live-state subscription behind it**. Everything else stays on live-state. The goal is
to surface surprises (Bun-vs-Node, TCP-vs-socket, replication prereqs, install friction) before
Stage 1 commits to a real plugin.

## Decisions (locked)

- **Render surface:** a new throwaway debug pane (`plugins/debug/plugins/zero-spike/`). Does
  not touch the real `TasksRecentView`. Mounts its **own local `ZeroProvider`** wrapping only
  this pane (minimal blast radius — not the app root).
- **zero-cache runtime:** a **manual Node sidecar** (`zero-cache` run by hand). No
  `database.json` / gateway-supervisor wiring — that is explicitly Stage 1/2 work.

## Surprises already surfaced by research (carry into Stage 1/2)

1. **zero-cache cannot run under Bun.** It requires Node v22+ and the native
   `@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3` binary (postinstall build). It is a separate sidecar process,
   never embeddable in our Bun server. → Stage 2 must supervise a Node process.
2. **zero-cache needs a direct TCP connection to Postgres**, but our embedded cluster runs
   `-c listen_addresses=` (empty → **Unix-socket only, no TCP**). The spike must open a TCP
   listener. Replication **cannot** traverse PgBouncer (transaction-mode pooling breaks the
   persistent walsender connection). Use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` (node-postgres tries a
   socket for `localhost` and breaks replication); do **not** append `?schema=public`.
3. **The embedded cluster is shared system-wide** (gateway-owned at `~/.singularity/postgres`),
   not per-worktree. Enabling `wal_level=logical` + a TCP listener affects every worktree.
   Both changes are **additive and non-breaking** (the existing trigger/`pg_notify` feed keeps
   working), and `wal_level` is just a postmaster restart — **no data-dir wipe needed**.
4. **Views aren't replicated.** `tasks_v`'s computed `status`/`active`/`finishedAt`/
   `dependencies` are not raw columns, so the spike syncs **raw `tasks` columns only**
   (`id`, `title`, `updatedAt`) — no attempt to reproduce status client-side.
5. **Permissions can be fully open** (`ANYONE_CAN`) for a read-only spike; no auth/JWT bridge.

## Prerequisite task (self-contained, committable) — "make the embedded cluster logical-replication-capable"

This is the **only** lasting change and is submitted on its own, **before** the spike. It is a
prerequisite for every Zero stage, not just this one. Reviewable in isolation: additive,
non-breaking, reversible.

Scope: the Step 1 edit below (`wal_level=logical` + `max_wal_senders`/`max_replication_slots`
+ the `listen_addresses=127.0.0.1` loopback TCP listener) to
`plugins/database/plugins/embedded/scripts/start.ts`, plus the one-time cluster restart and the
"existing app still healthy" verification. Self-contained acceptance: `show wal_level` =>
`logical`, a TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:5433` succeeds, and the existing live-state surfaces are
unaffected after the restart.

> Boundary note: `wal_level` is uncontroversially committable; the loopback TCP listener is the
> more opinionated half (the cluster is socket-only today). Both ship together here because the
> spike can't run without TCP and splitting them means two restarts for no benefit. If the TCP
> listener should instead stay spike-local (uncommitted) and be designed properly in Stage 2,
> drop it from this task and add it as an uncommitted local edit in the spike.

The spike (Steps 2–4) assumes this task has landed.

## The spike (throwaway) — implementation

> **Prerequisite status: LANDED & verified (2026-06-23).** Live cluster reports
> `wal_level=logical`, `listen_addresses=127.0.0.1`, `max_wal_senders=10`,
> `max_replication_slots=10`; the `start.ts` change is on `origin/main`. **First execution step:
> rebase this worktree onto `origin/main`** (`git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`)
> to pick up the prereq commit, then proceed with Step 2.

### Step 1 — Enable `wal_level=logical` + a TCP listener on the embedded cluster *(belongs to the prerequisite task above — DONE)*

File: `plugins/database/plugins/embedded/scripts/start.ts` (the `pg_ctl ... -o "..."` flag
string, ~line 170). Today it is:

```
-o `-k ${PG_SOCKET_DIR} -p ${PG_PORT} -c max_connections=${MAX_CONNECTIONS} -c listen_addresses=`
```

Change to (additive):

```
-o `-k ${PG_SOCKET_DIR} -p ${PG_PORT} -c max_connections=${MAX_CONNECTIONS} \
   -c listen_addresses=127.0.0.1 \
   -c wal_level=logical -c max_wal_senders=10 -c max_replication_slots=10`
```

- `wal_level` and `listen_addresses` are postmaster params → **require a restart** to apply.
  The supervisor only re-runs `start` on watchdog failure, so apply once manually:
  ```bash
  # one-time, system-level — like ./singularity start, treat with care
  pg_ctl -D ~/.singularity/postgres/data-pg18 \
    -o "-k ~/.singularity/postgres/socket -p 5433 -c max_connections=500 \
        -c listen_addresses=127.0.0.1 -c wal_level=logical \
        -c max_wal_senders=10 -c max_replication_slots=10" restart
  ```
  (Use the embedded `pg_ctl` binary — resolve via `$SINGULARITY_PG_BIN_DIR` or the
  `@embedded-postgres/<platform>` package, the same way `start.ts` does.)
- The cluster was `initdb`'d with `-A trust`, so the default `pg_hba.conf` already contains
  `host replication all 127.0.0.1/32 trust` — **verify** it's present; no edit expected.

**Verify replication prereqs** (direct connection, bypassing PgBouncer):
```bash
psql "postgresql://singularity@127.0.0.1:5433/singularity" \
  -c "show wal_level;"            # => logical
psql "postgresql://singularity@127.0.0.1:5433/singularity" \
  -c "select rolreplication from pg_roles where rolname='singularity';"  # => t (superuser implies it)
```

### Step 2 — Stand up the zero-cache sidecar (isolated, Node-managed)

Keep it **completely outside** the Bun workspace so the native postinstall lives in Node-land.
Use a throwaway dir under the scratchpad:

```bash
cd <scratchpad>/zero-spike
npm init -y
npm install @rocicorp/zero    # Node/npm, NOT bun — exercises the native zero-sqlite3 postinstall
```

Copy the **`hello-zero` starter's** `schema.ts` shape (cite: github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero)
and pare it to one table:

```ts
// schema.ts  (shared verbatim with the browser pane — see Step 3)
import { createSchema, createBuilder, table, string, number } from '@rocicorp/zero'

const task = table('task')
  .from('tasks')                       // physical table name
  .columns({
    id:        string(),
    title:     string(),
    updatedAt: number().from('updated_at'),  // timestamptz → epoch number
  })
  .primaryKey('id')

export const schema = createSchema({ tables: [task], relationships: [] })
export const zql = createBuilder(schema)
export type Schema = typeof schema
```

Permissions (open, for the spike): `ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING` on `task` via `definePermissions`
(deprecated but functional). Deploy them if zero-cache demands it
(`npx zero-deploy-permissions`) — **this exact step is a likely friction point; resolving it
is part of the spike.**

Run the sidecar:
```bash
ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB="postgresql://singularity@127.0.0.1:5433/singularity" \
ZERO_REPLICA_FILE="<scratchpad>/zero-spike/replica.db" \
ZERO_PORT=4848 \
ZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
npx zero-cache-dev
```
Watch the logs for: publication auto-create (`_zero_public_0`), replication-slot creation,
and the initial COPY of `tasks` into the SQLite replica. **These logs are the proof the
replication path works** — capture them in the writeup.

### Step 3 — New throwaway debug pane rendering via ZQL

New self-contained plugin `plugins/debug/plugins/zero-spike/` (mirror the registration shape of
an existing debug pane, e.g. `plugins/debug/plugins/logs/`):

- `web/index.ts` — barrel; `definePlugin` contributing a Debug sidebar entry + a `Pane.define`d
  pane.
- `web/components/zero-spike-pane.tsx` — wraps **only this pane** in a local `<ZeroProvider>`:
  ```tsx
  import { ZeroProvider, useQuery } from '@rocicorp/zero/react'
  import { schema, zql } from '../schema'   // same schema as the sidecar

  function TaskList() {
    const [tasks, result] = useQuery(zql.task.orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc').limit(50))
    if (result.type === 'unknown') return <Loading />
    return <ul>{tasks.map(t => <li key={t.id}>{t.title}</li>)}</ul>
  }

  export function ZeroSpikePane() {
    return (
      <ZeroProvider cacheURL="http://localhost:4848" schema={schema} userID={null}>
        <TaskList />
      </ZeroProvider>
    )
  }
  ```
- `web/schema.ts` — duplicate of the sidecar schema (throwaway; Stage 1 unifies this).
- `package.json` — add `@rocicorp/zero` as a dependency.

**Install-behavior surprise to capture:** `bun install` (run by `./singularity build`) will try
to build `@rocicorp/zero`'s native `zero-sqlite3` postinstall. The browser bundle only needs the
client + react subpaths, but the package is one unit. If the Bun install of the native binary
fails, document it — that friction is a Stage 1 input (likely: pin to client-only import path,
or vendor the client subpackage). The browser never *runs* the native binary; it only needs the
schema + `@rocicorp/zero/react` hooks to bundle.

### Step 4 — Build, run, and prove liveness

```bash
./singularity build
```
Open the new Debug → Zero Spike pane at `http://<worktree>.localhost:9000`. Then write to
`tasks` **directly via psql** (deterministic — bypasses all app code and the live-state path):
```bash
psql "postgresql://singularity@127.0.0.1:5433/singularity" \
  -c "update tasks set title = title || ' [zero-spike]' where id = (select id from tasks limit 1);"
```
The pane row must update **live**, with no `useResource`/live-state subscription behind it.

## Verification (success criteria)

- `show wal_level` → `logical`; existing live-state app surfaces still work (additive change
  proven non-breaking).
- zero-cache logs show slot creation + initial COPY of `tasks`.
- The debug pane renders tasks **with no live-state subscription** (grep the pane — only
  `useQuery` from `@rocicorp/zero/react`, never `useResource`).
- A `psql` `UPDATE`/`INSERT` on `tasks` is reflected in the pane within ~a frame, confirming
  WS frames originate from zero-cache (verify in browser devtools: WS to `localhost:4848`, not
  `/ws/notifications`).

## Disposal

Throwaway — **do not push**. To revert: delete `plugins/debug/plugins/zero-spike/`, revert
`embedded/scripts/start.ts`, restart the embedded cluster without the extra flags, drop the
spike's slot/publication, and `rm -rf` the scratchpad sidecar dir + `replica.db*`:
```sql
select pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name) from pg_replication_slots where slot_name like '%zero%';
drop publication if exists "_zero_public_0";
```

## Critical files

- `plugins/database/plugins/embedded/scripts/start.ts` — `pg_ctl -o` flags (wal_level + TCP).
- `plugins/database/plugins/embedded/shared/internal/paths.ts` — data dir, socket, port 5433.
- `plugins/debug/plugins/logs/` — registration shape to mirror for the new debug pane.
- `plugins/framework/plugins/web-core/web/App.tsx` — provider tree (reference only; spike
  mounts `ZeroProvider` locally in the pane, **not** here).
- `plugins/tasks/plugins/tasks-core/server/internal/tables.ts` — `tasks` raw columns.
- (Reference, not modified) `plugins/primitives/plugins/live-state/web/use-resource.ts`,
  `plugins/infra/plugins/launcher/server/internal/boot.ts` (`ensureDatabaseConfig`),
  `gateway/supervisor.go` — the seams Stage 1/2 will touch.

## Explicit non-goals

- Gateway/supervisor wiring of zero-cache (Stage 1/2).
- Per-worktree fork × replication-slot topology (Stage 2 — the hard one).
- Custom mutators / write path / auth-JWT bridge (Stage 1/3).
- Touching any real pane or any live-state code.

# Results & findings (executed 2026-06-23)

**Verdict: GO on the hard part.** Zero's `zero-cache` + Postgres **logical replication runs against
our embedded cluster** end-to-end on the server side. The only piece left unproven is the final
browser ZQL render (one client-side subscription nuance — see below), which is a Stage-1
integration detail, not an infra blocker. All spike code was reverted after the run.

Versions: `@rocicorp/zero` **1.6.2**, embedded **PG18**, Node **v25.9.0**, target DB = this
worktree's own fork `att-1782229091-5gyz` (chosen over main `singularity` so the slot lives in a
disposable fork). zero-cache run manually as a Node sidecar; permissions = `ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING`.

## ✅ Proven (with evidence)

| Mechanic | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `wal_level=logical` on the shared embedded cluster | `pg_settings` → `logical`; existing live-state app unaffected (prerequisite, now on `main`) |
| zero-cache connects over **direct TCP** (`127.0.0.1:5433`) | `Ensuring upstream PUBLICATION on att-…@127.0.0.1` |
| Auto-creates publications | `Upstream is setup with publications [_zero_metadata_0,_zero_public_0]` |
| **Creates a logical replication slot** | `Created replication slot zero_0_a … output_plugin:"pgoutput"` |
| **Initial COPY of the whole DB** | `Started 5 workers to copy 80 tables`; replica `zero.db` grew to ~52 MB; **no missing-PK failures** |
| Live streaming after COPY | replication status `stage:"Replicating"`, `status:"OK"`; column map `timestamptz→number, text→string, jsonb→json, int4→number` |
| **bun builds native `zero-sqlite3`** | `bun install` succeeded (the package declares `bun: >=1.1.0`) |
| **vite bundles `@rocicorp/zero/react`** for the browser | `./singularity build` frontend build succeeded; pane mounted |
| **Browser client connects cross-origin** to `ws://localhost:4848` | WS frames: `["connected",…]`, `pokeStart`/`pokeEnd`, `ping`/`pong` |
| Permission deploy | `zero-deploy-permissions` → `Deployed new permissions (hash=…)` |

## ❌ Unproven last mile: rows on screen

The throwaway pane rendered but stayed `status: unknown · 0 rows`. WS capture shows the client
connects and receives empty pokes but **never sends a `changeDesiredQueries` frame**, and
zero-cache registers **0 `tasks` queries** (only its internal `zero_0.clients` / `zero_0.mutations`).
So `useQuery(zql.task)` is not pushing the desired query to the server.

Ruled out: permissions (fixed — see footgun #3), `userID` (tried `null` and a real string, no
change), CORS/transport (WS handshake completes), bundling (pane mounts, no console errors). The
React `useQuery` path is correct per the 1.6.2 source (`addContextToQuery` + `viewStore.getView`),
and the view object *is* created (returns `[[], unknown]`, not the disabled snapshot) — yet the
client never syncs the query. **Most likely a 1.6.2 provider/query-builder wiring or a vite
tree-shake of Zero's binding side-effects (`import "./bindings.js"`).** Owned by Stage 1, which
stands up the real provider integration. A headless Node repro was inconclusive because the
browser uses `viewStore.getView` (not the `materialize()` path, which threw "Query is not
runnable" outside React).

## 🔑 Surprises surfaced (the deliverable)

1. **`rank_text` is unsupported by Zero — and silently dropped.** Boot log:
   `WARNING: zero does not yet support the "rank_text" data type. The "tasks"."rank" column will
   not be synced to clients.` Same for `agents`, `conversation_group_members`, `conversation_groups`,
   `conversations_ext_queue`, `page_blocks`, `page_blocks_ext_starred`. Our **fractional-index
   ordering primitive** (`primitives/rank`) is pervasive, so **rank-based ordering cannot be done
   client-side in ZQL** as-is. *Stage 3 impact: high* — either change the column's stored type, or
   add a Zero custom-type mapping, before migrating any ordered list.
2. **zero-cache cannot run under Bun; needs Node 22/24 (not 25).** It's a separate Node sidecar
   (native `@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3`), never embeddable in our Bun server. Node 25 throws EBADENGINE
   and breaks the `tsx`-based schema tooling (`zero-cache-dev`, `zero-deploy-permissions`) with an
   `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND … ?namespace=…`; **workaround: add `"type":"module"` to the sidecar
   package.json.** *Stage 2 impact:* the gateway supervisor must run a **Node** process for
   zero-cache, and our Bun-first toolchain doesn't cover it.
3. **`ANYONE_CAN` ≠ `ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING` — and the wrong one fails silently.** `ANYONE_CAN`
   is a single *rule* (`[null]`); assigning it to a table key compiles to `{}` = **deny**, with no
   error — the query just never hydrates. The table-level grant is `ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING`
   (`{row:{select:[null],…}}`). Declarative permissions are also **deprecated** (Zero is moving to
   server query/mutate endpoints) — relevant to Stage 1/3's permission model.
4. **Replication can't traverse PgBouncer** (transaction-mode pooling breaks the persistent
   walsender); zero-cache must dial PG **directly**. Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`; no
   `?schema=public`.
5. **A breaking-change DDL on the upstream triggers a Zero resync.** `./singularity build`'s
   graphile-worker migration (`--! breaking-change … rename to _private_jobs`) fired a
   `zero/0/ddl/ddlStart` event mid-spike. Zero's event-trigger DDL detection handled it (superuser
   cluster), but *Stage 2/3 must account for build-time migrations churning the replica.*
6. **A leftover slot retains WAL and will block fork teardown.** After the sidecar died, slot
   `zero_0_a` remained `active=false` on the worktree DB **retaining 458 MB of WAL**. An undropped
   logical slot **prevents `DROP DATABASE`**, so worktree-cleanup cannot reap this fork until it's
   dropped. *Stage 2 impact: high* — fork teardown (`debug/worktree-cleanup`) must drop the slot +
   publications first. **Manual cleanup still needed here** (see below).

### Harness footguns hit (report-don't-memorize)
- The **Write tool's path allowlist excludes the designated scratchpad** (`/private/tmp/claude-501/…`)
  even though the system prompt nominates it for temp files — Writes there are rejected as if
  editing the protected main repo. Worked around with Bash heredocs; the allowlist should include
  the scratchpad.
- `psql` is guarded (intentional) → the planned `psql`-write verification was swapped for the
  `add_task` MCP / app-UI path. Fine, but worth noting the spike's "write via psql" step is
  unavailable to agents.

## Cleanup state

Reverted: throwaway plugin `plugins/debug/plugins/zero-spike/`, the `e2e/` verify script, the
debug-sidebar config edit, and `bun.lock`; rebuilt so all autogen is back in sync; sidecar killed;
scratchpad sidecar dir is disposable. **Still requires one manual step** (no agent tool can drop a
slot — `psql` guarded, `query_db` read-only):

```sql
-- against att-1782229091-5gyz (direct, port 5433):
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('zero_0_a');
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS "_zero_public_0";
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS "_zero_metadata_0";
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS "zero" CASCADE;          -- app metadata
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS "zero_0" CASCADE;        -- shard metadata (cvr/cdc)
```
Until the slot is dropped, this worktree's DB fork cannot be `DROP DATABASE`'d.

## Recommendations for Stage 1 / Stage 2

- **Stage 1:** resolve the client `useQuery` subscription (provider wiring / vite binding
  side-effects) on a single-table slice first; pin the Node version for the sidecar (22/24);
  decide the permission/auth model given the declarative API is deprecated.
- **Stage 2:** the `rank_text` gap (#1) and the slot-blocks-fork-teardown lifecycle (#6) are the
  two findings that most shape the worktree × zero-cache topology — treat them as first-class
  inputs alongside the slot-per-fork vs shared-cache question.

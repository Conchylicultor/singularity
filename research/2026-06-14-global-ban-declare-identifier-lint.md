# Ban `declare` as a value binding name (lint rule)

## Context

A top-level `const declare = …` followed by a statement that references it as a
value (e.g. `declare.foo = …`) is silently **miscompiled by Bun's TS transform**.
Bun treats a statement beginning with the contextual keyword `declare` as a TS
*ambient declaration* and **erases it from the emitted JS** — no type error, no
runtime error; the property is just `undefined` at runtime.

This already caused a real silent failure: while wiring `Resource.Declare`'s
2-arg opt-in, a `const declare = …` binding made `Resource.Declare.getContributions`
`undefined` at runtime, so the boot-snapshot returned 0 resources with no signal
anywhere. It was only caught by manual inspection. The instance was fixed by
renaming to `declareResource`, but the trap is open repo-wide for any future
binding named `declare`.

The goal is to **eliminate this class of silent miscompile at the source** with a
contributed ESLint rule, instead of leaving it as tribal knowledge.

### Reproduction & investigation (done)

Confirmed empirically in `/tmp`:

```ts
const declare: { foo?: number } = {};
declare.foo = 42;
console.log(declare.foo);   // -> undefined under Bun
```

- **Bun** (`bun build`): emits `var declare = {}` and the `console.log`, but the
  `declare.foo = 42;` assignment is **dropped**. `bun run` prints `undefined`.
- **tsc 6.0.3** (`ts.transpileModule`): **keeps** `declare.foo = 42;`, **no
  diagnostics**. So this is a Bun divergence from the TS compiler, not expected
  TS behavior.
- Swept every TS contextual keyword (`namespace`, `module`, `global`, `type`,
  `interface`, `enum`, `abstract`, `async`, `static`, `get`, `set`, `of`, `as`,
  `from`, `infer`) through the same `const X = {…}; X.foo = 42;` pattern:
  **`declare` is the only one that silently drops.** `enum` and `let` fail
  loudly as reserved words; everything else transpiles correctly.
- Searched the repo: **zero** existing value-position identifiers named
  `declare` (the only "declare"-ish names are `declareResource` / `declareToken`
  in `plugins/framework/plugins/server-core/core/resources.ts`, which the rule
  must NOT flag). The rule ships with no false positives and no code migration.

**Follow-up (not in this plan):** report the divergence upstream to Bun. The lint
rule is the defensive guard regardless of upstream fix timeline.

## Approach

Add a new lint sub-plugin `bun-safety` under the lint umbrella, contributing one
rule `no-declare-identifier` that bans `declare` as a **value binding name**
(variables, function/param/class names, imports, catch params, destructuring).

Rationale for bindings-only: if nothing can be *named* `declare`, then no
`declare.foo = …` statement can ever reference a local `declare`. A stray
reference to an undeclared `declare` is already a `tsc` "Cannot find name" error
caught by `type-check`. So banning the binding fully closes the class without
touching property keys / member-expression `.declare` (which are legitimate).

Mirrors the existing `icon-safety` / `reactive-server-io` sub-plugins
byte-for-byte (`ESLintUtils.RuleCreator`, `{ name, rules }` barrel). Contributed
rules are auto-discovered by codegen (`lint.generated.ts`) and enabled as
`error` repo-wide on `**/*.{ts,tsx}` — no manual registration.

The banned set is a `Set` so adding another name later (should a future Bun
version regress another keyword) is a one-line change.

    return {
      "Program:exit"(node) {
        walk(sourceCode.getScope(node));
      },
    };
  },
});
```

Scope-walk (vs. AST selectors) is deliberate: one `Program:exit` pass over the
scope tree catches every binding kind — `var`/`let`/`const`, function & class
names, params, `import` bindings, catch params, and destructuring — because all
become `scope.variables`. References to an *undeclared* `declare` don't appear as
variables, so bindings-only falls out naturally.

### `lint/no-declare-identifier.test.ts` (optional, recommended)

`bun:test` + `@typescript-eslint/rule-tester` `RuleTester`:
- **invalid:** `const declare = {}`, `let declare = 1`, `function declare(){}`,
  `(declare) => declare`, `import { declare } from "x"`, `const { declare } = o`.
- **valid:** `const declareResource = {}` (substring must not match),
  `obj.declare = 1` (property name), `import { foo as bar } from "x"`,
  `const x = obj.declare`.

## Verification

1. `./singularity build` — regenerates `lint.generated.ts` to include the new
   sub-plugin and runs `./singularity check` (the `eslint` + `type-check` checks
   pick up the rule automatically; `plugins-doc-in-sync` / `plugins-registry-in-sync`
   stay green from the regen).
2. Negative check — confirm the rule actually fires. Temporarily add
   `const declare = {};` to any `.ts` file and run
   `./singularity check eslint` (or `bunx eslint <file>`); expect a
   `bun-safety/no-declare-identifier` error. Remove the temp line.
3. Positive check — confirm no false positives: `./singularity check` is clean
   repo-wide (in particular `resources.ts`'s `declareResource` / `declareToken`
   are untouched).
4. If the test file is added: `bun test plugins/framework/plugins/tooling/plugins/lint/plugins/bun-safety/lint/no-declare-identifier.test.ts`.

## Out of scope

- No code migration (zero existing offenders).
- Not banning other contextual keywords — empirically only `declare` is unsafe;
  the `Set` makes future additions trivial if Bun regresses.
- Upstream Bun bug report — separate follow-up.
